BROCAS BRAIN Carl Sagan They were apes only yesterday Give them time Once an ape always an ape No it will be different Come back here in an age or so and you shall see The gods discussing the Earth in the motion picture version of H G Wells The Man Who Could Work Miracles 1936 I T was a museum in a way like any other this Musee de lHomme Museum of Man situated on a pleasant eminence with from the restaurant plaza in back a splendid view of the Eiffel Tower We were there to talk with Yves Coppens the able associate director of the museum and a distinguished paleoanthropologist Coppens had studied the ancestors of mankind their fossils being found in Olduvai Gorge and Lake Turkana in Kenya and Tanzania and Ethiopia Two million years ago there were fourfoothigh creatures whom we call Homo habilis living in East Africa shearing and chipping and flaking stone tools perhaps building simple dwellings their brains in the course of a spectacular enlargement that would lead one day to us Institutions of this sort have a public and a private side The public side includes the exhibits in ethnography say or cultural anthropology the costumes of the Mongols or bark cloths painted by Native Americans some perhaps prepared especially for sale to voyageurs and enterprising French anthropologists But in the innards of the place there are other things people engaged in the construction of exhibits vast storerooms of items inappropriate because of subjest matter or space for general exhibition and areas for research We were led through a warren of dark musty rooms ranging from cubicles to rotundas Research materials overflowed into the corridors a reconstruction of a Paleolithic cave t1oor showing where the antelope bones had been thrown after eating Priapic wooden statuary from Melanesia Delicately painted eating utensils Grotesque ceremonial masks Assagailike throwing spears from Oceania A tattered poster of a steatopygous woman from Africa A dank and gloomy storeroom filled to the rafters with gourd woodwinds skin drums reed panpipes and innumerable other reminders of the indomitable human urge to make music Here and there could be found a few people actually engaged in research their sallow and deferential demeanours contrasting starkly with the hearty bilingual This paper is being published with the kind permission of the author HYPHEN Vol VI Number I24 CARL SAGAN competence of Coppens Most of the rooms were evidently used for storage of anthropological items collected from decades to more than a century ago You had the sense of a museum of the second order in which were stored not so much materials that might be of interest as materials that had once been of interest You could feel the presence of nineteenthcentury museum directors engaged in their frock coats in goniometrie and craniologie busily collecting and measuring everything in the pious hope that mere quantification would lead to understanding But there was another area of the museum still more remote a strange mix of active research and virtually abandoned cabinets and shelves A reconstructed and articulating skeleton of an orangutan A vast table covered with human skulls each neatly indexed A drawer full of femurs piled in disarray like the erasers in some school janitors supply closet A province dedicated to Neanderthal remains including the first Neanderthal skull reconstructed by Marcellin Boule which I held cautiously in my hands It felt lightweight and delicate the sutures starkly visible perhaps the first compelling piece of evidence that there once were creatures rather like us who became extinct a disquieting hint that our species likewise might not survive forever A tray filled with the teeth of many hominids including the great nutcracker molars of Australopithecus robustus a contemporary of Homo habilis A collection of CroMagnon sled cases stacked like cordwood scrubbed white and in order These items were reasonable and in a way expected the necessary shards of evidence for reconstructing something of the history of our ancestors and collateral relatives Deeper in the room were more macabre and more disturbing collections Two shrunken heads reposing on a cabinet sneering and grimacing their leathery lips curled back to reveal rows of sharp tiny teeth Jar upon jar of human embryos and foetuses pale white bathed in a murky greenish fluid each jar competently labelled Most specimens were normal but occasionally an anomaly could be glimpsed a disconcerting teratology Siamese twins joined at the sternum say or a foetus with two heads the four eyes tightly shut There was more An array of large cylindrical bottles containing to my astonishment perfectly preserved humau heads A redmustachioed man perhaps in his early twenties originating so the label said from Nouvelle Caledonie Perhaps he was a sailor who had jumped ship in the tropics only to be captured and executed his head involuntarily drafted in the cause of science Except he was not being studied he was only being neglected among the other severed heads A sweetfaced and delicate little girl of perhaps four years her pink coral earrings and necklace still perfectly preserved Three infant heads sharing the same bottle perhaps as an economy measure Men and women and children of both sexes and many races decapitated their heads shipped to France only toBROCAS BRAIN 25 moulder perhaps after some brief initial study in the Musee de lHomme What I wondered must the loading of the crates of bottled heads have been like Did the ships officers speculate over coffee about what was down in the hold Were the sailors heedless because the heads were by and large not those of white Europeans like themselves Did they joke about their cargo to demonstrate some emotional distance from the little twinge of horror they privately permitted themselves to feel When the collections arrived in Paris were the scientists brisk and businesslike giving orders to the draymen on the disposition of several heads Were they impatient to unseal the bottles and embrace the contents with calipers Did the man responsible for this collection whoever he might be view it with unalloyed pride and zest And then in a still more remote corner of this wing of the museum was revealed a collection of grey convoluted objects stored in formalin to retard spoilage shelf upon shelf of human brains There must have been someone whose job it was to perform routine craniotomies on the cadavers of notables and extract their brains for the benefit of science Here was the cerebrum of a European intellectual who had achieved momentary renown before fading into the obscurity of this dusty shelf Here a brain of a convicted murderer Doubtless the servants of earlier days had hoped there might be some anomaly some telltale sign in the brain anatomy or cranial configuration of murderers Perhaps they had hoped that murder was a matter of heredity and not society Phrenology was a graceless nineteenthcentury aberration I could hear my friend Ann Druyan saying The people we starve and torture have an unsociable tendency to steal and murder We think its because their brows overhang But the brains of murderers and savants the remains of Albert Einsteins brain are floating wanly in a bottle in Wichita are indistinguishable It is very probably society and not heredity that makes criminals While scanning the collection amid such ruminations my eye was caught by a label on one of the many low cylindrical bottles I took the container from the shelf and examined it more closely The label read P Broca In my hands was Brocas brain PAUL BROCA was a surgeon a neurologist and an anthropologist a major figure in the development of both medicine and anthropology in the midnineteenth century He performed distinguished work on cancer pathology and the treatment of aneurisms and made a landmark contribution to understanding the origins of aphasia an impairment of the ability to articulate ideas Broca was a brilliant and compassionate man He was concerned with medical care for the poor Under cover of darkness at the risk of his own life he successfully smuggled out of Paris in a horsedrawn cart 73 million francs stuffed into carpetbags and hidden26 CARL SAGAN under potatoes the treasury of the Assistance Publique which he believed at any rate he was saying from pillage He was the founder of modern brain surgery He studied infant mortality Towards the end of his career he was created a senator He loved as one biographer said mainly serenity and tolerance In 1848 he founded a society of freethinkers Almost alone among French savants of the time he was sympathetic to Charles Darwins idea of evolution by natural selection T H Huxley Darwins Bulldog remarked that the mere mention of Brocas name filled him with a sense of gratitude and Broca was quoted as saying I would rather be a transformed ape than a degenerate son of Adam For these and other views he was publicly denounced for materialism and like Socrates for corrupting the young But he was made a senator nevertheless Earlier Broca had encountered great difficulty in establishing a society of anthropology in France The Minister of Public Instruction and the Prefect of Police believed that anthropology must as the free pursuit of knowledge about human beings be innately subversive to the state When permission was at last and reluctantly granted for Broca to talk about science with eighteen colleagues the Prefect of Police held Broca responsible personally for all that might be said in such meetings against society religion or the government Even so the study of human beings was considered so dangerous that a police spy in plain clothes was assigned to attend all meetings with the understanding that authorization to meet would be withdrawn immediately if the spy was offended by anything that was said In these circumstances the Society of Anthropology of Paris gathered for the first time on May 19 1859 the year of the publication of The Origin of Species In subsequent meetings an enormous range of subjects was discussed archaeology mythology physiology anatomy medicine psychology linguistics and history and it is easy to imagine the police spy nodding off in the corner on many an occasion Once Broca rlated the spy wished to take a small unauthorized walk and asked if he might leave without anything threatening to the state being said in his absence No no my friend Broca responded You must not go for a walk sit down and earn your pay Not only the police but also the clergy opposed the development of anthropology in France and in 1876 the Roman Catholic political party organized a major campaign against the teaching of the subject in the Anthropological Institute of Paris founded by Broca Paul Broca died in 1880 perhaps of the very sort of aneurism that he had studied so brilliantly At the moment of his death he was working on a comprehensive study of brain anatomy He had established the first professional societies schools of research and scientific journals of modern anthropology in France His laboratory specimens became incorporated into what for many years was called the Musee Broca Later it merged to become a part of the Musee de lHommeBROCAS BRAIN 27 It was Broca himself whose brain I was cradling who had established the macabre collection I had been contemplating He had studied embryos and apes and people of all races measuring like mad in an effort to understand the nature of a human being And despite the present appearance of the collection and my suspicions he was not at least by the standards of his time more of a jingoist or a racist than most and certainly not that standby of fiction and more rarely of fact the cold uncaring dispassionate scientist heedless of the human consequences of what he does Broca very much cared In the Revue d Anthropologie of 1880 there is a complete bibliography of Brocas writings From the titles I could later glimpse something of the origins of the collection I had viewed On the Cranium and Brain of the Assassin Lemaire Presentation of the Brain of a Male Adult Gorilla On the Brain of the Assassin Prevost On the Supposed Heredity of Accidental Characteristics The Intelligence of Animals and the Rule of Humans The Order of the Primates Anatomical Parallels between Men and Apes The Origin of the Art of Making Fire On Double Monsters Discussion on Microcephalics Prehistoric Trepanning On Two Cases of a Supernumerary Digit Developing at an Adult Age The Heads of Two New Caledonians and On the Skull of Dante Alighieri I did not know the present resting place of the cranium of the author of The Divine Comedy but the collection of brains and skulls and heads that surrounded me clearly began in the work of Paul Broca BROCA was a superb brain anatomist and made important investigations of the limbic region earlier called the rhinencephalon the smell brain which we now know to be profoundly involved in human emotion But Broca is today perhaps best known for his discovery of a small region in the third convolution of the left frontal lobe of the cerebral cortex a region now known as Brocas area Articulate speech it turns out as Broca inferred on only fragmentary evidence is to an important extent localized in and controlled by Brocas area It was one of the first discoveries of a separation of function between the left and right hemispheres of the brain But most important it was one of the first indications that specific brain functions exist in particular locales in the brain that there is a connection between the anatomy of the brain and what the brain does an activity sometimes described as mind Ralph Holloway is a physical anthropologist at Columbia University whose laboratory I imagine must bear some resemblance to Brocas Holloway makes rubberlatex casts of the insides of skulls of human and related beings past and present to attempt a reconstruction from slight impressions on the interior of the cranium of what the brain must have been like Holloway believes that he can tell from a creatures cranium whether Brocas area is present and he has28 CARL SAGAN found evidence of an emerging Brocas area in the brain of Homo habilis some two million years ago just the time of the first constructions and the first tools To this limited extent there is something to the phrenological vision It is very plausible that human thought and industry went hand in hand with the development of articulate speech and Brocas area may in a very real sense be one of the seats of our humanity as well as a means for tracing our relationships with our ancestors on their way towards humanity And here was Brocas brain floating in formalin and in fragments before me I could make out the limbic region which Broca had studied in others I could see the convolutions on the neocortex I could even make out the greywhite left frontal lobe in which Brocas own Brocas area resided decaying and unnoticed in a musty corner of a collection that Broca had himself begun It was difficult to hold Brocas brain without wondering whether in some sense Broca was still in there his wit his sceptical mien his abrupt gesticulations when he talked his quiet and sentimental moments Might there be preserved in the configuration of neurons before me a recollection of the triumphant moment when he argued before the combined medical faculties and his father overt1owing with pride on the origins of aphasia A dinner with his friend Victor Hugo A stroll on a moonlit autumn evening his wife holding a pretty parasol along the Quai Voltaire and the Pont Royal Where do we go when we die Is Paul Broca still there in his formalinfilled bottle Perhaps the memory traces have decayed although there is good evidence from modern brain investigations that a given memory is redundantly stored in many different places in the brain Might it be possible at some future time when neurophysiology has advanced substantially to reconstruct the memories or insights of someone long dead And would that be a good thing It would be the ultimate breach of privacy But it would also be a kind of practical immortality because especially for a man like Broca our minds are clearly a major aspect of who we are From the character of this neglected storeroom in the Musee de lHomme I had been ready to attribute to those who had assembled the collection I had not known it was Broca at the time a palpable sexism and racism and jingoism a profound resistance to the idea of the relatedness of human beings and the other primates And in part it was true Broca was a humanist of the nineteenth century but unable to shake the consuming prejudices the human social diseases of his time He thought men superior to women and whites superior to blacks Even his onclusion that German brains were not significantly different from French ones was inrebuttal to a Teutonic claim of Gallic inferiority But he concluded that there were deep connections in brain physiology between gorillas and men Broca the founder of a society of freethinkers in his youth believed in the importance of llntrammelled inquiry and had lived his life in pursuit of that aimBROCAS BRAIN 29 His falling short of these ideals shows that someone as unstinting in the free pursuit of knowledge as Broca could still be deflected by endemic and respectable bigotry Society corrupts the best of us It is a little unfair I think to criticize a person for not sharing the enlightenment of a later epoch but it is also profoundly saddening that such prejudices were so extremely pervasive The question raises nagging uncertainties about which of the conventional truths of our own age will be considered unforgivable bigotry by the next One way to repay Paul Broca for this lesson which he has inadvertently provided us is to challenge deeply and seriously our own most strongly held beliefs These forgotten jars and their grisly contents had been collected at least partly in a humanistic spirit and perhaps in some era of future advance in brain studies they would prove useful once again I would be interested in knowing a little more about the redmustachioed man who had been in part returned to France from New Caledonia But the surroundings the sense of a chamber of horrors evoked unbidden other unsettling thoughts At the very least we feel in such a place a pang of sympathy for those especially those who died young or in pain who are in so unseemly a way thus memorialized Cannibals in northwestern New Guinea employ stacked skulls for doorposts and sometimes for lintels Perhaps these are the most convenient building materials available but the architects cannot be entirely unaware of the terror that their constructions evoke in unsuspecting passersby Skulls have been used by Hitlers 5S Hells Angels shamans pirates and even those who label bottles of iodine in a conscious effort to elicit terror And it makes perfectly good sense If I find myself in a room filled with skulls it is likely that there is someone nearby perhaps a pack of hyenas perhaps some gaunt and dedicated decapitator whose occupation or hobby it is to collect skulls Such fellows are almost certainly to be avoided or if possible killed The prickle of the hairs on the back of my neck the increased heartbeat and pulse rate that strange clanuny feeling are designed by evolution to make me fight or flee Those who avoid decapitation leave more offspring Experiencing such fears bestows an evolutionary advantage Finding yourself in a room full of brains is still more horrifying as if some unspeakable moral monster armed with ghastly blades and scooping tools were shuffling and drooling somewhere in the attics of the Musee de IHomme But all depends I think on the purpose of the collection If its objective is to find out if it has acquired human parts post mortem especially with the prior consent of those to whom the parts once belonged then little harm has been done and perhaps in the long run some significant human good But I am not sure the scientists are entirely free of the motives of those New Guinea cannibals are they not at least saying I live with these heads every day They30 CARL SAGAN dont bother me Why should you be so squeamish LEONARDO AND VESALlUS were reduced to bribery and stealth in order to perform the first systematic dissections of human beings in Europe although there had been a flourishing and competent school of anatomy in ancient Greece The first person to locate on the basis of neuroanatomy human intelligence in the head was Herophilus of Chalcedon who flourished around 300 BC He was also the first to distinguish the motor from the sensory nerves and performed the most thorough study of brain anatomy attempted until the Renaissance Undoubtedly there were those who objected to his gruesome experimental predilections There is a lurking fear made explicit in the Faust legend that some things are not meant to be known that some inquiries are too dangerous for human beings to make And in our own age the development of nuclear weapons may if we are unlucky or unwise turn out to be a case of precisely this sort But in the case of experiments on the brain our fears are less intellectual They run deeper into our evolutionary past They call up images of the wild boars and highwaymen who would terrorize travellers and rural populations in ancient Greece by Procrustean mutilation or other savagery until some hero Theseus or Hercules would effortlessly dispatch them These fears have served an adaptive and useful function in the past But I believe they are mostly emotional baggage in the present I was interested as a scientist who has written about the brain to find such revulsions hiding in me to be revealed for my inspection in Brocas collection These fears are worth fighting All inquiries carry with them some element of risk There is no guarantee that the universe will conform to our predispositions But I do not see how we can deal with the universe both the outside and the inside universe without studying it The best way to avoid abuses is for the populace in general to be scientifically literate to understand the implications of such investigations In exchange for freedom of inquiry scientists are obliged to explain their work If science is considered a closed priesthood too difficult and arcane for the average person to understand the dangers of abuse are greater But if science is a topic of general interest and concern if both its delights and its social consequences are discussed regularly and competently in the schools the press and at the dinner table we have greatly improved our prospects for learning how the world really is and for improving both it and us That is an idea I sometimes fancy that may be sitting there stili sluggish with formalin in Brocas brain CARL SAGAN is the author of the television series Cosmos Brocas Brain The Dragons of Eden and numerous other publications
