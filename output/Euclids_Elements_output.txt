antiquity and also has the distinction of being the worlds oldest continuously used mathematical textbook Little is known about the author beyond the fact that he lived in Alexandria around 300 BCE The main subjects of the work are geometry proportion and number theory Most of the theorems appearing in the Elements were not discovered by Euclid himself but were the work of earlier Greek mathematicians such as Pythagoras and his school Hippocrates of Chios Theaetetus of Athens and Eudoxus of Cnidos However Euclid is generally credited with arranging these theorems in a logical manner so as to demonstrate admittedly not always with the rigour demanded by modern mathematics that they necessarily follow from ve simple axioms Euclid is also credited with devising a number of particularly ingenious proofs of previously discovered theorems eg Theorem 48 in Book 1 The geometrical constructions employed in the Elements are restricted to those which can be achieved using a straightrule and a compass Furthermore empirical proofs by means of measurement are strictly forbidden ie any comparison of two magnitudes is restricted to saying that the magnitudes are either equal or that one is greater than the other The Elements consists of thirteen books Book 1 outlines the fundamental propositions of plane geometry includ ing the three cases in which triangles are congruent various theorems involving parallel lines the theorem regarding the sum of the angles in a triangle and the Pythagorean theorem Book 2 is commonly said to deal with geometric algebra since most of the theorems contained within it have simple algebraic interpretations Book 3 investigates circles and their properties and includes theorems on tangents and inscribed angles Book 4 is concerned with reg ular polygons inscribed in and circumscribed around circles Book 5 develops the arithmetic theory of proportion Book 6 applies the theory of proportion to plane geometry and contains theorems on similar gures Book 7 deals with elementary number theory eg prime numbers greatest common denominators etc Book 8 is concerned with geometric series Book 9 contains various applications of results in the previous two books and includes theorems on the innitude of prime numbers as well as the sum of a geometric series Book 10 attempts to classify incommen surable ie irrational magnitudes using the socalled method of exhaustion an ancient precursor to integration Book 11 deals with the fundamental propositions of threedimensional geometry Book 12 calculates the relative volumes of cones pyramids cylinders and spheres using the method of exhaustion Finally Book 13 investigates the ve socalled Platonic solids This edition of Euclids Elements presents the denitive Greek textie that edited by JL Heiberg 1883 1885accompanied by a modern English translation as well as a GreekEnglish lexicon Neither the spurious books 14 and 15 nor the extensive scholia which have been added to the Elements over the centuries are included The aim of the translation is to make the mathematical argument as clear and unambiguous as possible whilst still adhering closely to the meaning of the original Greek Text within square parenthesis in both Greek and English indicates material identied by Heiberg as being later interpolations to the original text some particularly obvious or unhelpful interpolations have been omitted altogether Text within round parenthesis in English indicates material which is implied but not actually present in the Greek text My thanks to Mariusz Wodzicki Berkeley for typesetting

5STOIQEIWN a ELEMENTS BOOK 1 V Oroi Denitions 1 A point is that of which there is no part 2 And a line is a length without breadth 3 And the extremities of a line are points 4 A straightline is any one which lies evenly with points on itself 5 And a surface is that which has length and breadth only 6 And the extremities of a surface are lines 7 A plane surface is any one which lies evenly with the straightlines on itself 8 And a plane angle is the inclination of the lines to one another when two lines in a plane meet one another and are not lying in a straightline 9 And when the lines containing the angle are straight then the angle is called rectilinear 10 And when a straightline stood upon another straightline makes adjacent angles which are equal to one another each of the equal angles is a rightangle and the former straightline is called a perpendicular to that upon which it stands 11 An obtuse angle is one greater than a rightangle 12 And an acute angle is one less than a rightangle 13 A boundary is that which is the extremity of some thing 14 A gure is that which is contained by some bound ary or boundaries 15 A circle is a plane gure contained by a single line which is called a circumference such that all of the straightlines radiating towards the circumference from one point amongst those lying inside the gure are equal to one another 16 And the point is called the center of the circle 17 And a diameter of the circle is any straightline being drawn through the center and terminated in each direction by the circumference of the circle And any such straightline also cuts the circle in half 18 And a semicircle is the gure contained by the diameter and the circumference cuts off by it And the center of the semicircle is the same point as the center of the circle 19 Rectilinear gures are those gures contained by straightlines trilateral gures being those contained by three straightlines quadrilateral by four and multi lateral by more than four 20 And of the trilateral gures an equilateral trian gle is that having three equal sides an isosceles triangle that having only two equal sides and a scalene triangle that having three unequal sides 6STOIQEIWN a ELEMENTS BOOK 1 21 And further of the trilateral gures a rightangled triangle is that having a rightangle an obtuseangled triangle that having an obtuse angle and an acute angled triangle that having three acute angles 22 And of the quadrilateral gures a square is that which is rightangled and equilateral a rectangle that which is rightangled but not equilateral a rhombus that which is equilateral but not rightangled and a rhomboid that having opposite sides and angles equal to one an other which is neither rightangled nor equilateral And let quadrilateral gures besides these be called trapezia 23 Parallel lines are straightlines which being in the same plane and being produced to innity in each direc tion meet with one another in neither of these direc tions This should really be counted as a postulate rather than as part of a denition A t mat a Postulates 1 Let it have been postulated to draw a straightline from any point to any point 2 And to produce a nite straightline continuously in a straightline 3 And to draw a circle with any center and radius 4 And that all rightangles are equal to one another 5 And that if a straightline falling across two other straightlines makes internal angles on the same side of itself whose sum is less than two rightangles then the two other straightlines being produced to innity meet on that side of the original straightline that the sum of the internal angles is less than two rightangles and do not meet on the other side The Greek present perfect tense indicates a past action with present signicance Hence the 3rdperson present perfect imperative Hi t sjw could be translated as let it be postulated in the sense let it stand as postulated but not let the postulate be now brought forward The literal translation let it have been postulated sounds awkward in English but more accurately captures the meaning of the Greek This postulate effectively species that we are dealing with the geometry of at rather than curved space Koi na nnoiai Common Notions 1 Things equal to the same thing are also equal to one another 2 And if equal things are added to equal things then the wholes are equal 3 And if equal things are subtracted from equal things then the remainders are equal 4 And things coinciding with one another are equal to one another 5 And the whole is greater than the part As an obvious extension of CNs 2 3if equal things are added or subtracted from the two sides of an inequality then the inequality remains 7STOIQEIWN a ELEMENTS BOOK 1 an inequality of the same type a Proposition 1 To construct an equilateral triangle on a given nite straightline B A E D C Let AB be the given nite straightline So it is required to construct an equilateral triangle on the straightline AB Let the circle BCD with center A and radius AB have been drawn Post 3 and again let the circle ACE with center B and radius BA have been drawn Post 3 And let the straightlines CA and CB have been joined from the point C where the circles cut one another to the points A and B respectively Post 1 And since the point A is the center of the circle CDB AC is equal to AB Def 115 Again since the point B is the center of the circle CAE BC is equal to BA Def 115 But CA was also shown to be equal to AB Thus CA and CB are each equal to AB But things equal to the same thing are also equal to one another CN 1 Thus CA is also equal to CB Thus the three straight lines CA AB and BC are equal to one another Thus the triangle ABC is equilateral and has been constructed on the given nite straightline AB Which is the very thing it was required to do The assumption that the circles do indeed cut one another should be counted as an additional postulate There is also an implicit assumption that two straightlines cannot share a common segment b Proposition 2 To place a straightline equal to a given straightline at a given point as an extremity Let A be the given point and BC the given straight line So it is required to place a straightline at point A equal to the given straightline BC For let the straightline AB have been joined from point A to point B Post 1 and let the equilateral trian gle DAB have been been constructed upon it Prop 11 8STOIQEIWN a ELEMENTS BOOK 1 And let the straightlines AE and BF have been pro duced in a straightline with DA and DB respectively Post 2 And let the circle CGH with center B and ra dius BC have been drawn Post 3 and again let the cir cle GKL with center D and radius DG have been drawn Post 3 L K H C D B A G F E Therefore since the point B is the center of the cir cle CGH BC is equal to BG Def 115 Again since the point D is the center of the circle GKL DL is equal to DG Def 115 And within these DA is equal to DB Thus the remainder AL is equal to the remainder BG CN 3 But BC was also shown to be equal to BG Thus AL and BC are each equal to BG But things equal to the same thing are also equal to one another CN 1 Thus AL is also equal to BC Thus the straightline AL equal to the given straight line BC has been placed at the given point A Which is the very thing it was required to do This proposition admits of a number of different cases depending on the relative positions of the point A and the line BC In such situations Euclid invariably only considers one particular caseusually the most difcultand leaves the remaining cases as exercises for the reader g Proposition 3 For two given unequal straightlines to cut off from the greater a straightline equal to the lesser Let AB and C be the two given unequal straightlines of which let the greater be AB So it is required to cut off a straightline equal to the lesser C from the greater AB Let the line AD equal to the straightline C have been placed at point A Prop 12 And let the circle DEF have been drawn with center A and radius AD Post 3 9STOIQEIWN a ELEMENTS BOOK 1 And since point A is the center of circle DEF AE is equal to AD Def 115 But C is also equal to AD Thus AE and C are each equal to AD So AE is also equal to C CN 1 E D C A F B Thus for two given unequal straightlines AB and C the straightline AE equal to the lesser C has been cut off from the greater AB Which is the very thing it was required to do d Proposition 4 If two triangles have two sides equal to two sides re spectively and have the angles enclosed by the equal straightlines equal then they will also have the base equal to the base and the triangle will be equal to the tri angle and the remaining angles subtended by the equal sides will be equal to the corresponding remaining an gles F B A C E D Let ABC and DEF be two triangles having the two sides AB and AC equal to the two sides DE and DF re spectively That is AB to DE and AC to DF And let the angle BAC be equal to the angle EDF I say that the base BC is also equal to the base EF and triangle ABC will be equal to triangle DEF and the remaining angles subtended by the equal sides will be equal to the corresponding remaining angles That is ABC to DEF and ACB to DFE For if triangle ABC is applied to triangle DEF the point A being placed on the point D and the straightline 10STOIQEIWN a ELEMENTS BOOK 1 AB on DE then the point B will also coincide with E on account of AB being equal to DE So because of AB coinciding with DE the straightline AC will also coincide with DF on account of the angle BAC being equal to EDF So the point C will also coincide with the point F again on account of AC being equal to DF But point B certainly also coincided with point E so that the base BC will coincide with the base EF For if B coin cides with E and C with F and the base BC does not coincide with EF then two straightlines will encompass an area The very thing is impossible Post 1 Thus the base BC will coincide with EF and will be equal to it CN 4 So the whole triangle ABC will coincide with the whole triangle DEF and will be equal to it CN 4 And the remaining angles will coincide with the remain ing angles and will be equal to them CN 4 That is ABC to DEF and ACB to DFE CN 4 Thus if two triangles have two sides equal to two sides respectively and have the angles enclosed by the equal straightline equal then they will also have the base equal to the base and the triangle will be equal to the tri angle and the remaining angles subtended by the equal sides will be equal to the corresponding remaining an gles Which is the very thing it was required to show The application of one gure to another should be counted as an additional postulate Since Post 1 implicitly assumes that the straightline joining two given points is unique e Proposition 5 For isosceles triangles the angles at the base are equal to one another and if the equal sides are produced then the angles under the base will be equal to one another B D F C G A E Let ABC be an isosceles triangle having the side AB equal to the side AC and let the straightlines BD and CE have been produced in a straightline with AB and AC respectively Post 2 I say that the angle ABC is equal to ACB and angle CBD to BCE For let the point F have been taken at random on BD and let AG have been cut off from the greater AE equal 11STOIQEIWN a ELEMENTS BOOK 1 to the lesser AF Prop 13 Also let the straightlines FC and GB have been joined Post 1 In fact since AF is equal to AG and AB to AC the two straightlines FA AC are equal to the two straightlines GA AB respectively They also encom pass a common angle FAG Thus the base FC is equal to the base GB and the triangle AFC will be equal to the triangle AGB and the remaining angles subtendend by the equal sides will be equal to the corresponding remain ing angles Prop 14 That is ACF to ABG and AFC to AGB And since the whole of AF is equal to the whole of AG within which AB is equal to AC the remainder BF is thus equal to the remainder CG CN 3 But FC was also shown to be equal to GB So the two straight lines BF FC are equal to the two straightlines CG GB respectively and the angle BFC is equal to the angle CGB and the base BC is common to them Thus the triangle BFC will be equal to the triangle CGB and the remaining angles subtended by the equal sides will be equal to the corresponding remaining angles Prop 14 Thus FBC is equal to GCB and BCF to CBG There fore since the whole angle ABG was shown to be equal to the whole angle ACF within which CBG is equal to BCF the remainder ABC is thus equal to the remainder ACB CN 3 And they are at the base of triangle ABC And FBC was also shown to be equal to GCB And they are under the base Thus for isosceles triangles the angles at the base are equal to one another and if the equal sides are produced then the angles under the base will be equal to one an other Which is the very thing it was required to show Proposition 6 If a triangle has two angles equal to one another then the sides subtending the equal angles will also be equal to one another D A C B Let ABC be a triangle having the angle ABC equal to the angle ACB I say that side AB is also equal to side AC 12STOIQEIWN a ELEMENTS BOOK 1 For if AB is unequal to AC then one of them is greater Let AB be greater And let DB equal to the lesser AC have been cut off from the greater AB Prop 13 And let DC have been joined Post 1 Therefore since DB is equal to AC and BC is com mon the two sides DB BC are equal to the two sides AC CB respectively and the angle DBC is equal to the angle ACB Thus the base DC is equal to the base AB and the triangle DBC will be equal to the triangle ACB Prop 14 the lesser to the greater The very notion is absurd CN 5 Thus AB is not unequal to AC Thus it is equal Thus if a triangle has two angles equal to one another then the sides subtending the equal angles will also be equal to one another Which is the very thing it was required to show Here use is made of the previously unmentioned common notion that if two quantities are not unequal then they must be equal Later on use is made of the closely related common notion that if two quantities are not greater than or less than one another respectively then they must be equal to one another z Proposition 7 On the same straightline two other straightlines equal respectively to two given straightlines which meet cannot be constructed meeting at a different point on the same side of the straightline but having the same ends as the given straightlines B A C D For if possible let the two straightlines AC CB equal to two other straightlines AD DB respectively have been constructed on the same straightline AB meeting at different points C and D on the same side of AB and having the same ends on AB So CA is equal to DA having the same end A as it and CB is equal to DB having the same end B as it And let CD have been joined Post 1 Therefore since AC is equal to AD the angle ACD is also equal to angle ADC Prop 15 Thus ADC is greater than DCB CN 5 Thus CDB is much greater than DCB CN 5 Again since CB is equal to DB the angle CDB is also equal to angle DCB Prop 15 But it was shown that the former angle is also much greater 13STOIQEIWN a ELEMENTS BOOK 1 than the latter The very thing is impossible Thus on the same straightline two other straight lines equal respectively to two given straightlines which meet cannot be constructed meeting at a dif ferent point on the same side of the straightline but having the same ends as the given straightlines Which is the very thing it was required to show h Proposition 8 If two triangles have two sides equal to two sides re spectively and also have the base equal to the base then they will also have equal the angles encompassed by the equal straightlines D G B E F C A Let ABC and DEF be two triangles having the two sides AB and AC equal to the two sides DE and DF respectively That is AB to DE and AC to DF Let them also have the base BC equal to the base EF I say that the angle BAC is also equal to the angle EDF For if triangle ABC is applied to triangle DEF the point B being placed on point E and the straightline BC on EF then point C will also coincide with F on account of BC being equal to EF So because of BC coinciding with EF the sides BA and CA will also co incide with ED and DF respectively For if base BC coincides with base EF but the sides AB and AC do not coincide with ED and DF respectively but miss like EG and GF in the above gure then we will have con structed upon the same straightline two other straight lines equal respectively to two given straightlines and meeting at a different point on the same side of the straightline but having the same ends But such straightlines cannot be constructed Prop 17 Thus the base BC being applied to the base EF the sides BA and AC cannot not coincide with ED and DF respec tively Thus they will coincide So the angle BAC will also coincide with angle EDF and will be equal to it CN 4 Thus if two triangles have two sides equal to two side respectively and have the base equal to the base 14STOIQEIWN a ELEMENTS BOOK 1 then they will also have equal the angles encompassed by the equal straightlines Which is the very thing it was required to show j Proposition 9 To cut a given rectilinear angle in half F D B C E A Let BAC be the given rectilinear angle So it is re quired to cut it in half Let the point D have been taken at random on AB and let AE equal to AD have been cut off from AC Prop 13 and let DE have been joined And let the equilateral triangle DEF have been constructed upon DE Prop 11 and let AF have been joined I say that the angle BAC has been cut in half by the straightline AF For since AD is equal to AE and AF is common the two straightlines DA AF are equal to the two straightlines EA AF respectively And the base DF is equal to the base EF Thus angle DAF is equal to angle EAF Prop 18 Thus the given rectilinear angle BAC has been cut in half by the straightline AF Which is the very thing it was required to do i Proposition 10 To cut a given nite straightline in half Let AB be the given nite straightline So it is re quired to cut the nite straightline AB in half Let the equilateral triangle ABC have been con structed upon AB Prop 11 and let the angle ACB have been cut in half by the straightline CD Prop 19 I say that the straightline AB has been cut in half at point D For since AC is equal to CB and CD is common 15STOIQEIWN a ELEMENTS BOOK 1 the two straightlines AC CD are equal to the two straightlines BC CD respectively And the angle ACD is equal to the angle BCD Thus the base AD is equal to the base BD Prop 14 B A D C Thus the given nite straightline AB has been cut in half at point D Which is the very thing it was required to do ia Proposition 11 To draw a straightline at rightangles to a given straightline from a given point on it D A F C E B Let AB be the given straightline and C the given point on it So it is required to draw a straightline from the point C at rightangles to the straightline AB Let the point D be have been taken at random on AC and let CE be made equal to CD Prop 13 and let the equilateral triangle FDE have been constructed on DE Prop 11 and let FC have been joined I say that the straightline FC has been drawn at rightangles to the given straightline AB from the given point C on it For since DC is equal to CE and CF is common the two straightlines DC CF are equal to the two straightlines EC CF respectively And the base DF is equal to the base FE Thus the angle DCF is equal to the angle ECF Prop 18 and they are adjacent But when a straightline stood on another straightline 16STOIQEIWN a ELEMENTS BOOK 1 makes the adjacent angles equal to one another each of the equal angles is a rightangle Def 110 Thus each of the angles DCF and FCE is a rightangle Thus the straightline CF has been drawn at right angles to the given straightline AB from the given point C on it Which is the very thing it was required to do ib Proposition 12 To draw a straightline perpendicular to a given in nite straightline from a given point which is not on it D A G H F E B C Let AB be the given innite straightline and C the given point which is not on AB So it is required to draw a straightline perpendicular to the given innite straightline AB from the given point C which is not on AB For let point D have been taken at random on the other side to C of the straightline AB and let the circle EFG have been drawn with center C and radius CD Post 3 and let the straightline EG have been cut in half at point H Prop 110 and let the straight lines CG CH and CE have been joined I say that the straightline CH has been drawn perpendicular to the given innite straightline AB from the given point C which is not on AB For since GH is equal to HE and HC is common the two straightlines GH HC are equal to the two straightlines EH HC respectively and the base CG is equal to the base CE Thus the angle CHG is equal to the angle EHC Prop 18 and they are adjacent But when a straightline stood on another straightline makes the adjacent angles equal to one another each of the equal angles is a rightangle and the former straight line is called a perpendicular to that upon which it stands Def 110 Thus the straightline CH has been drawn perpen dicular to the given innite straightline AB from the 17STOIQEIWN a ELEMENTS BOOK 1 given point C which is not on AB Which is the very thing it was required to do ig Proposition 13 If a straightline stood on another straightline makes angles it will certainly either make two right angles or angles whose sum is equal to two right angles C A E D B For let some straightline AB stood on the straight line CD make the angles CBA and ABD I say that the angles CBA and ABD are certainly either two right angles or have a sum equal to two rightangles In fact if CBA is equal to ABD then they are two rightangles Def 110 But if not let BE have been drawn from the point B at rightangles to the straight line CD Prop 111 Thus CBE and EBD are two rightangles And since CBE is equal to the two an gles CBA and ABE let EBD have been added to both Thus the sum of the angles CBE and EBD is equal to the sum of the three angles CBA ABE and EBD CN 2 Again since DBA is equal to the two an gles DBE and EBA let ABC have been added to both Thus the sum of the angles DBA and ABC is equal to the sum of the three angles DBE EBA and ABC CN 2 But the sum of CBE and EBD was also shown to be equal to the sum of the same three an gles And things equal to the same thing are also equal to one another CN 1 Therefore the sum of CBE and EBD is also equal to the sum of DBA and ABC But the sum of CBE and EBD is two rightangles Thus the sum of ABD and ABC is also equal to two rightangles Thus if a straightline stood on another straight line makes angles it will certainly either make two right angles or angles whose sum is equal to two right angles Which is the very thing it was required to show 18STOIQEIWN a ELEMENTS BOOK 1 id Proposition 14 If two straightlines not lying on the same side make adjacent angles whose sum is equal to two rightangles with some straightline at a point on it then the two straightlines will be straighton with respect to one an other B C D E A For let two straightlines BC and BD not lying on the same side make adjacent angles ABC and ABD whose sum is equal to two rightangles with some straightline AB at the point B on it I say that BD is straighton with respect to CB For if BD is not straighton to BC then let BE be straighton to CB Therefore since the straightline AB stands on the straightline CBE the sum of the angles ABC and ABE is thus equal to two rightangles Prop 113 But the sum of ABC and ABD is also equal to two right angles Thus the sum of angles CBA and ABE is equal to the sum of angles CBA and ABD CN 1 Let an gle CBA have been subtracted from both Thus the re mainder ABE is equal to the remainder ABD CN 3 the lesser to the greater The very thing is impossible Thus BE is not straighton with respect to CB Simi larly we can show that neither is any other straight line than BD Thus CB is straighton with respect to BD Thus if two straightlines not lying on the same side make adjacent angles whose sum is equal to two right angles with some straightline at a point on it then the two straightlines will be straighton with respect to one another Which is the very thing it was required to show ie Proposition 15 If two straightlines cut one another then they make the vertically opposite angles equal to one another 19STOIQEIWN a ELEMENTS BOOK 1 For let the two straightlines AB and CD cut one an other at the point E I say that angle AEC is equal to angle DEB and angle CEB to angle AED D A E B C For since the straightline AE stands on the straight line CD making the angles CEA and AED the sum of the angles CEA and AED is thus equal to two right angles Prop 113 Again since the straightline DE stands on the straightline AB making the angles AED and DEB the sum of the angles AED and DEB is thus equal to two rightangles Prop 113 But the sum of CEA and AED was also shown to be equal to two rightangles Thus the sum of CEA and AED is equal to the sum of AED and DEB CN 1 Let AED have been subtracted from both Thus the remainder CEA is equal to the remainder BED CN 3 Similarly it can be shown that CEB and DEA are also equal Thus if two straightlines cut one another then they make the vertically opposite angles equal to one another Which is the very thing it was required to show i Proposition 16 For any triangle when one of the sides is produced the external angle is greater than each of the internal and opposite angles Let ABC be a triangle and let one of its sides BC have been produced to D I say that the external angle ACD is greater than each of the internal and opposite angles CBA and BAC Let the straightline AC have been cut in half at point E Prop 110 And BE being joined let it have been produced in a straightline to point F And let EF be made equal to BE Prop 13 and let FC have been joined and let AC have been drawn through to point G Therefore since AE is equal to EC and BE to EF the two straightlines AE EB are equal to the two 20STOIQEIWN a ELEMENTS BOOK 1 straightlines CE EF respectively Also angle AEB is equal to angle FEC for they are vertically opposite Prop 115 Thus the base AB is equal to the base FC and the triangle ABE is equal to the triangle FEC and the remaining angles subtended by the equal sides are equal to the corresponding remaining angles Prop 14 Thus BAE is equal to ECF But ECD is greater than ECF Thus ACD is greater than BAE Similarly by having cut BC in half it can be shown that BCGthat is to say ACDis also greater than ABC E B A C G F D Thus for any triangle when one of the sides is pro duced the external angle is greater than each of the in ternal and opposite angles Which is the very thing it was required to show The implicit assumption that the point F lies in the interior of the angle ABC should be counted as an additional postulate iz Proposition 17 v For any triangle the sum of two angles taken to gether in any possible way is less than two rightangles B A C D Let ABC be a triangle I say that the sum of two angles of triangle ABC taken together in any possible way is less than two rightangles 21STOIQEIWN a ELEMENTS BOOK 1 For let BC have been produced to D And since the angle ACD is external to triangle ABC it is greater than the internal and opposite angle ABC Prop 116 Let ACB have been added to both Thus the sum of the angles ACD and ACB is greater than the sum of the angles ABC and BCA But the sum of ACD and ACB is equal to two rightangles Prop 113 Thus the sum of ABC and BCA is less than two right v angles Similarly we can show that the sum of BAC and ACB is also less than two rightangles and further that the sum of CAB and ABC is less than two right angles Thus for any triangle the sum of two angles taken together in any possible way is less than two right angles Which is the very thing it was required to show ih Proposition 18 In any triangle the greater side subtends the greater angle A D B C For let ABC be a triangle having side AC greater than AB I say that angle ABC is also greater than BCA For since AC is greater than AB let AD be made equal to AB Prop 13 and let BD have been joined And since angle ADB is external to triangle BCD it is greater than the internal and opposite angle DCB Prop 116 But ADB is equal to ABD since side AB is also equal to side AD Prop 15 Thus ABD is also greater than ACB Thus ABC is much greater than ACB Thus in any triangle the greater side subtends the greater angle Which is the very thing it was required to show ij Proposition 19 In any triangle the greater angle is subtended by the greater side Let ABC be a triangle having the angle ABC greater than BCA I say that side AC is also greater than side AB 22STOIQEIWN a ELEMENTS BOOK 1 For if not AC is certainly either equal to or less than AB In fact AC is not equal to AB For then angle ABC would also have been equal to ACB Prop 15 But it is not Thus AC is not equal to AB Neither indeed is AC less than AB For then angle ABC would also have been less than ACB Prop 118 But it is not Thus AC is not less than AB But it was shown that AC is not equal to AB either Thus AC is greater than AB C B A Thus in any triangle the greater angle is subtended by the greater side Which is the very thing it was re quired to show k Proposition 20 In any triangle the sum of two sides taken to gether in any possible way is greater than the remaining side B A D C For let ABC be a triangle I say that in triangle ABC the sum of two sides taken together in any possible way is greater than the remaining side So the sum of BA and AC is greater than BC the sum of AB 23STOIQEIWN a ELEMENTS BOOK 1 and BC than AC and the sum of BC and CA than AB For let BA have been drawn through to point D and let AD be made equal to CA Prop 13 and let DC have been joined Therefore since DA is equal to AC the angle ADC is also equal to ACD Prop 15 Thus BCD is greater than ADC And since DCB is a triangle having the angle BCD greater than BDC and the greater angle subtends the greater side Prop 119 DB is thus greater than BC But DA is equal to AC Thus the sum of BA and AC is greater than BC Similarly we can show that the sum of AB and BC is also greater than CA and the sum of BC and CA than AB Thus in any triangle the sum of two sides taken to gether in any possible way is greater than the remaining side Which is the very thing it was required to show ka Proposition 21 If two internal straightlines are constructed on one of the sides of a triangle from its ends the constructed straightlines will be less than the two remaining sides of the triangle but will encompass a greater angle B A E C D For let the two internal straightlines BD and DC have been constructed on one of the sides BC of the tri angle ABC from its ends B and C respectively I say that BD and DC are less than the sum of the two re maining sides of the triangle BA and AC but encompass an angle BDC greater than BAC For let BD have been drawn through to E And since in any triangle the sum of any two sides is greater than the remaining side Prop 120 in triangle ABE the sum of the two sides AB and AE is thus greater than BE Let EC have been added to both Thus the sum of BA and AC is greater than the sum of BE and EC Again since in triangle CED the sum of the two sides CE and ED is greater than CD let DB have been added to both Thus the sum of CE and EB is greater than the sum of CD and DB But the sum of BA and AC was shown to be greater than the sum of BE and EC Thus the sum of BA and AC is much greater than 24STOIQEIWN a ELEMENTS BOOK 1 the sum of BD and DC Again since in any triangle the external angle is greater than the internal and opposite angles Prop 116 in triangle CDE the external angle BDC is thus greater than CED Accordingly for the same reason the external angle CEB of the triangle ABE is also greater than BAC But BDC was shown to be greater than CEB Thus BDC is much greater than BAC Thus if two internal straightlines are constructed on one of the sides of a triangle from its ends the con structed straightlines are less than the two remain ing sides of the triangle but encompass a greater angle Which is the very thing it was required to show kb Proposition 22 To construct a triangle from three straightlines which are equal to three given straightlines It is necessary for the sum of two of the straightlines taken together in any possible way to be greater than the remaining one on account of the fact that in any triangle the sum of two sides taken together in any possible way is greater than the remaining one Prop 120 H A B C D F E K L G Let A B and C be the three given straightlines of which let the sum of two taken together in any possible way be greater than the remaining one Thus the sum of A and B is greater than C the sum of A and C than B and also the sum of B and C than A So it is required to construct a triangle from straightlines equal to A B and C Let some straightline DE be set out terminated at D and innite in the direction of E And let DF made equal to A and FG equal to B and GH equal to C Prop 13 And let the circle DKL have been drawn with center F and radius FD Again let the circle KLH have been drawn with center G and radius GH And let KF and KG have been joined I say that the triangle KFG has 25STOIQEIWN a ELEMENTS BOOK 1 been constructed from three straightlines equal to A B and C For since point F is the center of the circle DKL FD is equal to FK But FD is equal to A Thus KF is also equal to A Again since point G is the center of the circle LKH GH is equal to GK But GH is equal to C Thus KG is also equal to C And FG is also equal to B Thus the three straightlines KF FG and GK are equal to A B and C respectively Thus the triangle KFG has been constructed from the three straightlines KF FG and GK which are equal to the three given straightlines A B and C re spectively Which is the very thing it was required to do kg Proposition 23 To construct a rectilinear angle equal to a given recti linear angle at a given point on a given straightline C G A F B E D Let AB be the given straightline A the given point on it and DCE the given rectilinear angle So it is re quired to construct a rectilinear angle equal to the given rectilinear angle DCE at the given point A on the given straightline AB Let the points D and E have been taken at random on each of the straightlines CD and CE respectively and let DE have been joined And let the triangle AFG have been constructed from three straightlines which are equal to CD DE and CE such that CD is equal to AF CE to AG and further DE to FG Prop 122 Therefore since the two straightlines DC CE are equal to the two straightlines FA AG respectively and the base DE is equal to the base FG the angle DCE is thus equal to the angle FAG Prop 18 Thus the rectilinear angle FAG equal to the given rectilinear angle DCE has been constructed at the given point A on the given straightline AB Which 26STOIQEIWN a ELEMENTS BOOK 1 is the very thing it was required to do kd Proposition 24 If two triangles have two sides equal to two sides re spectively but one has the angle encompassed by the equal straightlines greater than the corresponding an gle in the other then the former triangle will also have a base greater than the base of the latter F A C B D E G Let ABC and DEF be two triangles having the two sides AB and AC equal to the two sides DE and DF respectively That is AB equal to DE and AC to DF Let them also have the angle at A greater than the angle at D I say that the base BC is also greater than the base EF For since angle BAC is greater than angle EDF let angle EDG equal to angle BAC have been constructed at the point D on the straightline DE Prop 123 And let DG be made equal to either of AC or DF Prop 13 and let EG and FG have been joined Therefore since AB is equal to DE and AC to DG the two straightlines BA AC are equal to the two straightlines ED DG respectively Also the angle BAC is equal to the angle EDG Thus the base BC is equal to the base EG Prop 14 Again since DF is equal to DG angle DGF is also equal to angle DFG Prop 15 Thus DFG is greater than EGF Thus EFG is much greater than EGF And since triangle EFG has angle EFG greater than EGF and the greater angle is subtended by the greater side Prop 119 side EG is thus also greater than EF But EG is equal to BC Thus BC is also greater than EF Thus if two triangles have two sides equal to two sides respectively but one has the angle encompassed by the equal straightlines greater than the correspond ing angle in the other then the former triangle will also have a base greater than the base of the latter 27STOIQEIWN a ELEMENTS BOOK 1 Which is the very thing it was required to show ke Proposition 25 If two triangles have two sides equal to two sides respectively but one has a base greater than the base of the other then the former triangle will also have the angle encompassed by the equal straightlines greater than the corresponding angle in the latter F B A C D E Let ABC and DEF be two triangles having the two sides AB and AC equal to the two sides DE and DF respectively That is AB equal to DE and AC to DF And let the base BC be greater than the base EF I say that angle BAC is also greater than EDF For if not BAC is certainly either equal to or less than EDF In fact BAC is not equal to EDF For then the base BC would also have been equal to the base EF Prop 14 But it is not Thus angle BAC is not equal to EDF Neither indeed is BAC less than EDF For then the base BC would also have been less than the base EF Prop 124 But it is not Thus angle BAC is not less than EDF But it was shown that BAC is not equal to EDF either Thus BAC is greater than EDF Thus if two triangles have two sides equal to two sides respectively but one has a base greater than the base of the other then the former triangle will also have the angle encompassed by the equal straightlines greater than the corresponding angle in the latter Which is the very thing it was required to show k Proposition 26 If two triangles have two angles equal to two angles respectively and one side equal to one sidein fact ei ther that by the equal angles or that subtending one of the equal anglesthen the triangles will also have the remaining sides equal to the corresponding remaining sides and the remaining angle equal to the remaining angle 28STOIQEIWN a ELEMENTS BOOK 1 Let ABC and DEF be two triangles having the two angles ABC and BCA equal to the two angles DEF and EFD respectively That is ABC equal to DEF and BCA to EFD And let them also have one side equal to one side First of all the side by the equal angles That is BC equal to EF I say that they will have the remaining sides equal to the corresponding remain ing sides That is AB equal to DE and AC to DF And they will have the remaining angle equal to the remaining angle That is BAC equal to EDF A G B H C D F E For if AB is unequal to DE then one of them is greater Let AB be greater and let BG be made equal to DE Prop 13 and let GC have been joined Therefore since BG is equal to DE and BC to EF the two straightlines GB BC are equal to the two straightlines DE EF respectively And angle GBC is equal to angle DEF Thus the base GC is equal to the base DF and triangle GBC is equal to triangle DEF and the remaining angles subtended by the equal sides will be equal to the corresponding remaining angles Prop 14 Thus GCB is equal to DFE But DFE was assumed to be equal to BCA Thus BCG is also equal to BCA the lesser to the greater The very thing is impossible Thus AB is not unequal to DE Thus it is equal And BC is also equal to EF So the two straightlines AB BC are equal to the two straight lines DE EF respectively And angle ABC is equal to angle DEF Thus the base AC is equal to the base DF and the remaining angle BAC is equal to the remaining angle EDF Prop 14 But again let the sides subtending the equal angles be equal for instance let AB be equal to DE Again I say that the remaining sides will be equal to the remain ing sides That is AC equal to DF and BC to EF Furthermore the remaining angle BAC is equal to the remaining angle EDF For if BC is unequal to EF then one of them is greater If possible let BC be greater And let BH be made equal to EF Prop 13 and let AH have been joined And since BH is equal to EF and AB to DE the two straightlines AB BH are equal to the two 29STOIQEIWN a ELEMENTS BOOK 1 straightlines DE EF respectively And the angles they encompass are also equal Thus the base AH is equal to the base DF and the triangle ABH is equal to the triangle DEF and the remaining angles subtended by the equal sides will be equal to the corresponding remaining angles Prop 14 Thus angle BHA is equal to EFD But EFD is equal to BCA So in triangle AHC the external angle BHA is equal to the internal and opposite angle BCA The very thing is impossi ble Prop 116 Thus BC is not unequal to EF Thus it is equal And AB is also equal to DE So the two straightlines AB BC are equal to the two straight lines DE EF respectively And they encompass equal angles Thus the base AC is equal to the base DF and triangle ABC is equal to triangle DEF and the re maining angle BAC is equal to the remaining angle EDF Prop 14 Thus if two triangles have two angles equal to two angles respectively and one side equal to one sidein fact either that by the equal angles or that subtending one of the equal anglesthen the triangles will also have the remaining sides equal to the corresponding re maining sides and the remaining angle equal to the re maining angle Which is the very thing it was required to show The Greek text has BG BC which is obviously a mistake kz Proposition 27 If a straightline falling across two straightlines makes the alternate angles equal to one another then the two straightlines will be parallel to one another F A C E B G D For let the straightline EF falling across the two straightlines AB and CD make the alternate angles AEF and EFD equal to one another I say that AB and CD are parallel For if not being produced AB and CD will certainly meet together either in the direction of B and D or in the direction of A and C Def 123 Let them have been produced and let them meet together in the di rection of B and D at point G So for the triangle 30STOIQEIWN a ELEMENTS BOOK 1 GEF the external angle AEF is equal to the interior and opposite angle EFG The very thing is impossible Prop 116 Thus being produced AB and CD will not meet together in the direction of B and D Similarly it can be shown that neither will they meet together in the direction of A and C But straightlines meeting in neither direction are parallel Def 123 Thus AB and CD are parallel Thus if a straightline falling across two straightlines makes the alternate angles equal to one another then the two straightlines will be parallel to one another Which is the very thing it was required to show kh Proposition 28 If a straightline falling across two straightlines makes the external angle equal to the internal and oppo site angle on the same side or makes the sum of the internal angles on the same side equal to two right angles then the two straightlines will be parallel to one another F A C E G B D H For let EF falling across the two straightlines AB and CD make the external angle EGB equal to the in ternal and opposite angle GHD or the sum of the in ternal angles on the same side BGH and GHD equal to two rightangles I say that AB is parallel to CD For since in the rst case EGB is equal to GHD but EGB is equal to AGH Prop 115 AGH is thus also equal to GHD And they are alternate angles Thus AB is parallel to CD Prop 127 Again since in the second case the sum of BGH and GHD is equal to two rightangles and the sum of AGH and BGH is also equal to two rightangles Prop 113 the sum of AGH and BGH is thus equal to the sum of BGH and GHD Let BGH have been subtracted from both Thus the remainder AGH is equal to the remainder GHD And they are alternate angles Thus AB is parallel to CD Prop 127 31STOIQEIWN a ELEMENTS BOOK 1 Thus if a straightline falling across two straightlines makes the external angle equal to the internal and oppo site angle on the same side or makes the sum of the internal angles on the same side equal to two right angles then the two straightlines will be parallel to one another Which is the very thing it was required to show kj Proposition 29 A straightline falling across parallel straightlines makes the alternate angles equal to one another the ex ternal angle equal to the internal and opposite angle and the sum of the internal angles on the same side equal to two rightangles F A C E G B D H For let the straightline EF fall across the parallel straightlines AB and CD I say that it makes the alter nate angles AGH and GHD equal the external angle EGB equal to the internal and opposite angle GHD and the sum of the internal angles on the same side BGH and GHD equal to two rightangles For if AGH is unequal to GHD then one of them is greater Let AGH be greater Let BGH have been added to both Thus the sum of AGH and BGH is greater than the sum of BGH and GHD But the sum of AGH and BGH is equal to two rightangles Prop 113 Thus the sum of BGH and GHD is also less than two rightangles But straightlines being produced to innity from internal angles whose sum is less than two rightangles meet together Post 5 Thus AB and CD being produced to innity will meet together But they do not meet on account of them initially being assumed parallel to one another Def 123 Thus AGH is not unequal to GHD Thus it is equal But AGH is equal to EGB Prop 115 And EGB is thus also equal to GHD Let BGH be added to both Thus the sum of EGB and BGH is equal to the sum of BGH and GHD But the sum of EGB and BGH is equal to two right 32STOIQEIWN a ELEMENTS BOOK 1 angles Prop 113 Thus the sum of BGH and GHD is also equal to two rightangles Thus a straightline falling across parallel straight lines makes the alternate angles equal to one another the external angle equal to the internal and opposite an gle and the sum of the internal angles on the same side equal to two rightangles Which is the very thing it was required to show l Proposition 30 Straightlines parallel to the same straightline are also parallel to one another C A E K G F D H B Let each of the straightlines AB and CD be parallel to EF I say that AB is also parallel to CD For let the straightline GK fall across AB CD and EF And since the straightline GK has fallen across the parallel straightlines AB and EF angle AGK is thus equal to GHF Prop 129 Again since the straightline GK has fallen across the parallel straightlines EF and CD angle GHF is equal to GKD Prop 129 But AGK was also shown to be equal to GHF Thus AGK is also equal to GKD And they are alternate angles Thus AB is parallel to CD Prop 127 Thus straightlines parallel to the same straight line are also parallel to one another Which is the very thing it was required to show la Proposition 31 To draw a straightline parallel to a given straightline through a given point Let A be the given point and BC the given straight line So it is required to draw a straightline parallel to the straightline BC through the point A Let the point D have been taken a random on BC and let AD have been joined And let angle DAE equal to angle ADC have been constructed on the straightline 33STOIQEIWN a ELEMENTS BOOK 1 DA at the point A on it Prop 123 And let the straight line AF have been produced in a straightline with EA C E B D A F And since the straightline AD in falling across the two straightlines BC and EF has made the alternate angles EAD and ADC equal to one another EAF is thus parallel to BC Prop 127 Thus the straightline EAF has been drawn parallel to the given straightline BC through the given point A Which is the very thing it was required to do lb Proposition 32 In any triangle if one of the sides is produced then the external angle is equal to the sum of the two internal and opposite angles and the sum of the three internal angles of the triangle is equal to two rightangles C A E D B Let ABC be a triangle and let one of its sides BC have been produced to D I say that the external angle ACD is equal to the sum of the two internal and oppo site angles CAB and ABC and the sum of the three internal angles of the triangleABC BCA and CAB is equal to two rightangles For let CE have been drawn through point C parallel to the straightline AB Prop 131 And since AB is parallel to CE and AC has fallen across them the alternate angles BAC and ACE are equal to one another Prop 129 Again since AB is parallel to CE and the straightline BD has fallen across them the external angle ECD is equal to the internal and opposite angle ABC Prop 129 But ACE was also shown to be equal to BAC Thus the whole an 34STOIQEIWN a ELEMENTS BOOK 1 gle ACD is equal to the sum of the two internal and opposite angles BAC and ABC Let ACB have been added to both Thus the sum of ACD and ACB is equal to the sum of the three angles ABC BCA and CAB But the sum of ACD and ACB is equal to two rightangles Prop 113 Thus the sum of ACB CBA and CAB is also equal to two rightangles Thus in any triangle if one of the sides is pro duced then the external angle is equal to the sum of the two internal and opposite angles and the sum of the three internal angles of the triangle is equal to two rightangles Which is the very thing it was required to show lg Proposition 33 Straightlines joining equal and parallel straight lines on the same sides are themselves also equal and parallel D C B A Let AB and CD be equal and parallel straightlines and let the straightlines AC and BD join them on the same sides I say that AC and BD are also equal and parallel Let BC have been joined And since AB is paral lel to CD and BC has fallen across them the alter nate angles ABC and BCD are equal to one another Prop 129 And since AB is equal to CD and BC is common the two straightlines AB BC are equal to the two straightlines DC CBAnd the angle ABC is equal to the angle BCD Thus the base AC is equal to the base BD and triangle ABC is equal to triangle DCB and the remaining angles will be equal to the corresponding remaining angles subtended by the equal sides Prop 14 Thus angle ACB is equal to CBD Also since the straightline BC in falling across the two straightlines AC and BD has made the alternate angles ACB and CBD equal to one another AC is thus parallel to BD Prop 127 And AC was also shown to be equal to BD Thus straightlines joining equal and parallel straight 35STOIQEIWN a ELEMENTS BOOK 1 lines on the same sides are themselves also equal and parallel Which is the very thing it was required to show The Greek text has BC CD which is obviously a mistake The Greek text has DCB which is obviously a mistake ld Proposition 34 In parallelogrammic gures the opposite sides and angles are equal to one another and a diagonal cuts them in half C A B D Let ACDB be a parallelogrammic gure and BC its diagonal I say that for parallelogram ACDB the oppo site sides and angles are equal to one another and the diagonal BC cuts it in half For since AB is parallel to CD and the straightline BC has fallen across them the alternate angles ABC and BCD are equal to one another Prop 129 Again since AC is parallel to BD and BC has fallen across them the alternate angles ACB and CBD are equal to one another Prop 129 So ABC and BCD are two tri angles having the two angles ABC and BCA equal to the two angles BCD and CBD respectively and one side equal to one sidethe one by the equal angles and common to them namely BC Thus they will also have the remaining sides equal to the corresponding re maining sides and the remaining angle equal to the remaining angle Prop 126 Thus side AB is equal to CD and AC to BD Furthermore angle BAC is equal to CDB And since angle ABC is equal to BCD and CBD to ACB the whole angle ABD is thus equal to the whole angle ACD And BAC was also shown to be equal to CDB Thus in parallelogrammic gures the opposite sides and angles are equal to one another And I also say that a diagonal cuts them in half For since AB is equal to CD and BC is common the two straightlines AB BC are equal to the two straight lines DC CB respectively And angle ABC is equal to angle BCD Thus the base AC is also equal to DB 36STOIQEIWN a ELEMENTS BOOK 1 and triangle ABC is equal to triangle BCD Prop 14 Thus the diagonal BC cuts the parallelogram ACDB in half Which is the very thing it was required to show The Greek text has CD BC which is obviously a mistake The Greek text has ABCD which is obviously a mistake le Proposition 35 Parallelograms which are on the same base and be tween the same parallels are equal to one another B C D E G A F Let ABCD and EBCF be parallelograms on the same base BC and between the same parallels AF and BC I say that ABCD is equal to parallelogram EBCF For since ABCD is a parallelogram AD is equal to BC Prop 134 So for the same reasons EF is also equal to BC So AD is also equal to EF And DE is common Thus the whole straightline AE is equal to the whole straightline DF And AB is also equal to DC So the two straightlines EA AB are equal to the two straightlines FD DC respectively And angle FDC is equal to angle EAB the external to the inter nal Prop 129 Thus the base EB is equal to the base FC and triangle EAB will be equal to triangle DFC Prop 14 Let DGE have been taken away from both Thus the remaining trapezium ABGD is equal to the re maining trapezium EGCF Let triangle GBC have been added to both Thus the whole parallelogram ABCD is equal to the whole parallelogram EBCF Thus parallelograms which are on the same base and between the same parallels are equal to one another Which is the very thing it was required to show Here for the rst time equal means equal in area rather than congruent l Proposition 36 Parallelograms which are on equal bases and between the same parallels are equal to one another Let ABCD and EFGH be parallelograms which are on the equal bases BC and FG and are between the same parallels AH and BG I say that the parallelogram 37STOIQEIWN a ELEMENTS BOOK 1 ABCD is equal to EFGH G A D E H F C B For let BE and CH have been joined And since BC is equal to FG but FG is equal to EH Prop 134 BC is thus equal to EH And they are also parallel and EB and HC join them But straightlines joining equal and par allel straightlines on the same sides are themselves equal and parallel Prop 133 thus EB and HC are also equal and parallel Thus EBCH is a parallelogram Prop 134 and is equal to ABCD For it has the same base BC as ABCD and is between the same paral lels BC and AH as ABCD Prop 135 So for the same reasons EFGH is also equal to the same par allelogram EBCH Prop 134 So that the parallelo gram ABCD is also equal to EFGH Thus parallelograms which are on equal bases and between the same parallels are equal to one another Which is the very thing it was required to show lz Proposition 37 Triangles which are on the same base and between the same parallels are equal to one another A E D C F B Let ABC and DBC be triangles on the same base BC and between the same parallels AD and BC I say that triangle ABC is equal to triangle DBC Let AD have been produced in both directions to E and F and let the straightline BE have been drawn through B parallel to CA Prop 131 and let the straightline CF have been drawn through C parallel to BD Prop 131 Thus EBCA and DBCF are both parallelograms and are equal For they are on the same base BC and between the same parallels BC and EF Prop 135 And the triangle ABC is half of the paral lelogram EBCA For the diagonal AB cuts the latter in 38STOIQEIWN a ELEMENTS BOOK 1 half Prop 134 And the triangle DBC is half of the parallelogram DBCF For the diagonal DC cuts the lat ter in half Prop 134 And the halves of equal things are equal to one another Thus triangle ABC is equal to triangle DBC Thus triangles which are on the same base and between the same parallels are equal to one another Which is the very thing it was required to show This is an additional common notion lh Proposition 38 Triangles which are on equal bases and between the same parallels are equal to one another F E A D G H B C Let ABC and DEF be triangles on the equal bases BC and EF and between the same parallels BF and AD I say that triangle ABC is equal to triangle DEF For let AD have been produced in both directions to G and H and let the straightline BG have been drawn through B parallel to CA Prop 131 and let the straightline FH have been drawn through F parallel to DE Prop 131 Thus GBCA and DEFH are each parallelograms And GBCA is equal to DEFH For they are on the equal bases BC and EF and between the same parallels BF and GH Prop 136 And triangle ABC is half of the parallelogram GBCA For the diago nal AB cuts the latter in half Prop 134 And triangle FED is half of parallelogram DEFH For the diagonal DF cuts the latter in half And the halves of equal things are equal to one another Thus triangle ABC is equal to triangle DEF Thus triangles which are on equal bases and between the same parallels are equal to one another Which is the very thing it was required to show lj Proposition 39 Equal triangles which are on the same base and on the same side are also between the same parallels Let ABC and DBC be equal triangles which are on the same base BC and on the same side of it I say that 39STOIQEIWN a ELEMENTS BOOK 1 they are also between the same parallels E A B D C For let AD have been joined I say that AD and BC are parallel For if not let AE have been drawn through point A parallel to the straightline BC Prop 131 and let EC have been joined Thus triangle ABC is equal to triangle EBC For it is on the same base as it BC and between the same parallels Prop 137 But ABC is equal to DBC Thus DBC is also equal to EBC the greater to the lesser The very thing is impossible Thus AE is not parallel to BC Similarly we can show that neither is any other straightline than AD Thus AD is parallel to BC Thus equal triangles which are on the same base and on the same side are also between the same parallels Which is the very thing it was required to show m Proposition 40 Equal triangles which are on equal bases and on the same side are also between the same parallels F A C D E B Let ABC and CDE be equal triangles on the equal bases BC and CE respectively and on the same side of BE I say that they are also between the same par allels For let AD have been joined I say that AD is parallel to BE For if not let AF have been drawn through A parallel to BE Prop 131 and let FE have been joined Thus triangle ABC is equal to triangle FCE For they are on equal bases BC and CE and between the same paral lels BE and AF Prop 138 But triangle ABC is equal 40STOIQEIWN a ELEMENTS BOOK 1 to triangle DCE Thus triangle DCE is also equal to triangle FCE the greater to the lesser The very thing is impossible Thus AF is not parallel to BE Similarly we can show that neither is any other straightline than AD Thus AD is parallel to BE Thus equal triangles which are on equal bases and on the same side are also between the same parallels Which is the very thing it was required to show This whole proposition is regarded by Heiberg as a relatively early interpolation to the original text ma Proposition 41 If a parallelogram has the same base as a triangle and is between the same parallels then the parallelogram is double the area of the triangle B A D E C For let parallelogram ABCD have the same base BC as triangle EBC and let it be between the same parallels BC and AE I say that parallelogram ABCD is double the area of triangle BEC For let AC have been joined So triangle ABC is equal to triangle EBC For it is on the same base BC as EBC and between the same parallels BC and AE Prop 137 But parallelogram ABCD is double the area of triangle ABC For the diagonal AC cuts the for mer in half Prop 134 So parallelogram ABCD is also double the area of triangle EBC Thus if a parallelogram has the same base as a trian gle and is between the same parallels then the parallel ogram is double the area of the triangle Which is the very thing it was required to show mb Proposition 42 To construct a parallelogram equal to a given triangle in a given rectilinear angle Let ABC be the given triangle and D the given recti linear angle So it is required to construct a parallelogram equal to triangle ABC in the rectilinear angle D 41STOIQEIWN a ELEMENTS BOOK 1 F D E G C B A Let BC have been cut in half at E Prop 110 and let AE have been joined And let angle CEF equal to angle D have been constructed at the point E on the straightline EC Prop 123 And let AG have been drawn through A parallel to EC Prop 131 and let CG have been drawn through C parallel to EF Prop 131 Thus FECG is a parallelogram And since BE is equal to EC triangle ABE is also equal to triangle AEC For they are on the equal bases BE and EC and between the same parallels BC and AG Prop 138 Thus tri angle ABC is double the area of triangle AEC And parallelogram FECG is also double the area of triangle AEC For it has the same base as AEC and is between the same parallels as AEC Prop 141 Thus paral lelogram FECG is equal to triangle ABC FECG also has the angle CEF equal to the given angle D Thus parallelogram FECG equal to the given trian gle ABC has been constructed in the angle CEF which is equal to D Which is the very thing it was required to do mg Proposition 43 For any parallelogram the complements of the paral lelograms about the diagonal are equal to one another Let ABCD be a parallelogram and AC its diagonal And let EH and FG be the parallelograms about AC and BK and KD the socalled complements about AC I say that the complement BK is equal to the complement KD For since ABCD is a parallelogram and AC its diago nal triangle ABC is equal to triangle ACD Prop 134 Again since EH is a parallelogram and AK is its diago nal triangle AEK is equal to triangle AHK Prop 134 So for the same reasons triangle KFC is also equal to triangle KGC Therefore since triangle AEK is equal to triangle AHK and KFC to KGC triangle AEK plus KGC is equal to triangle AHK plus KFC And the whole triangle ABC is also equal to the whole triangle ADC Thus the remaining complement BK is equal to 42STOIQEIWN a ELEMENTS BOOK 1 the remaining complement KD K C D E H A B G F Thus for any parallelogramic gure the comple ments of the parallelograms about the diagonal are equal to one another Which is the very thing it was required to show md Proposition 44 To apply a parallelogram equal to a given triangle to a given straightline in a given rectilinear angle B C D F E K M L A H G Let AB be the given straightline C the given trian gle and D the given rectilinear angle So it is required to apply a parallelogram equal to the given triangle C to the given straightline AB in an angle equal to angle D Let the parallelogram BEFG equal to the triangle C have been constructed in the angle EBG which is equal to D Prop 142 And let it have been placed so that BE is straighton to AB And let FG have been drawn through to H and let AH have been drawn through A parallel to either of BG or EF Prop 131 and let HB have been joined And since the straightline HF falls across the parallels AH and EF the sum of the an gles AHF and HFE is thus equal to two rightangles 43STOIQEIWN a ELEMENTS BOOK 1 Prop 129 Thus the sum of BHG and GFE is less than two rightangles And straightlines produced to innity from internal angles whose sum is less than two rightangles meet together Post 5 Thus being pro duced HB and FE will meet together Let them have been produced and let them meet together at K And let KL have been drawn through point K parallel to either of EA or FH Prop 131 And let HA and GB have been produced to points L and M respectively Thus HLKF is a parallelogram and HK its diagonal And AG and ME are parallelograms and LB and BF the socalled complements about HK Thus LB is equal to BF Prop 143 But BF is equal to triangle C Thus LB is also equal to C Also since angle GBE is equal to ABM Prop 115 but GBE is equal to D ABM is thus also equal to angle D Thus the parallelogram LB equal to the given trian gle C has been applied to the given straightline AB in the angle ABM which is equal to D Which is the very thing it was required to do This can be achieved using Props 13 123 and 131 me Proposition 45 To construct a parallelogram equal to a given rectilin ear gure in a given rectilinear angle Let ABCD be the given rectilinear gure and E the given rectilinear angle So it is required to construct a parallelogram equal to the rectilinear gure ABCD in the given angle E Let DB have been joined and let the parallelogram FH equal to the triangle ABD have been constructed in the angle HKF which is equal to E Prop 142 And let the parallelogram GM equal to the triangle DBC have been applied to the straightline GH in the angle GHM which is equal to E Prop 144 And since angle E is equal to each of angles HKF and GHM an gle HKF is thus also equal to GHM Let KHG have been added to both Thus the sum of FKH and KHG is equal to the sum of KHG and GHM But the sum of FKH and KHG is equal to two rightangles Prop 129 Thus the sum of KHG and GHM is also equal to two rightangles So two straightlines KH and HM not lying on the same side make adjacent an gles with some straightline GH at the point H on it whose sum is equal to two rightangles Thus KH is straighton to HM Prop 114 And since the straight line HG falls across the parallels KM and FG the al ternate angles MHG and HGF are equal to one another Prop 129 Let HGL have been added to both Thus the sum of MHG and HGL is equal to the sum of 44STOIQEIWN a ELEMENTS BOOK 1 HGF and HGL But the sum of MHG and HGL is equal to two rightangles Prop 129 Thus the sum of HGF and HGL is also equal to two rightangles Thus FG is straighton to GL Prop 114 And since FK is equal and parallel to HG Prop 134 but also HG to ML Prop 134 KF is thus also equal and parallel to ML Prop 130 And the straightlines KM and FL join them Thus KM and FL are equal and parallel as well Prop 133 Thus KFLM is a parallelogram And since triangle ABD is equal to parallelogram FH and DBC to GM the whole rectilinear gure ABCD is thus equal to the whole parallelogram KFLM F A D B C E K H G M L Thus the parallelogram KFLM equal to the given rectilinear gure ABCD has been constructed in the an gle FKM which is equal to the given angle E Which is the very thing it was required to do The proof is only given for a foursided gure However the extension to manysided gures is trivial m Proposition 46 To describe a square on a given straightline Let AB be the given straightline So it is required to describe a square on the straightline AB Let AC have been drawn at rightangles to the straightline AB from the point A on it Prop 111 and let AD have been made equal to AB Prop 13 And let DE have been drawn through point D parallel to AB Prop 131 and let BE have been drawn through point B parallel to AD Prop 131 Thus ADEB is a parallelogram Therefore AB is equal to DE and AD to BE Prop 134 But AB is equal to AD Thus the four sides BA AD DE and EB are equal to one another Thus the parallelogram ADEB is equilateral So I say that it is also rightangled For since the straightline 45STOIQEIWN a ELEMENTS BOOK 1 AD falls across the parallels AB and DE the sum of the angles BAD and ADE is equal to two rightangles Prop 129 But BAD is a rightangle Thus ADE is also a rightangle And for parallelogrammic gures the opposite sides and angles are equal to one another Prop 134 Thus each of the opposite angles ABE and BED are also rightangles Thus ADEB is right angled And it was also shown to be equilateral D C E A B Thus ADEB is a square Def 122 And it is de scribed on the straightline AB Which is the very thing it was required to do mz Proposition 47 In rightangled triangles the square on the side sub tending the rightangle is equal to the sum of the squares on the sides containing the rightangle Let ABC be a rightangled triangle having the angle BACa rightangle I say that the square on BC is equal to the sum of the squares on BA and AC For let the square BDEC have been described on BC and the squares GB and HC on AB and AC respectively Prop 146 And let AL have been drawn through point A parallel to either of BD or CE Prop 131 And let AD and FC have been joined And since angles BAC and BAG are each rightangles then two straightlines AC and AG not lying on the same side make the adjacent angles with some straightline BA at the point A on it whose sum is equal to two rightangles Thus CA is straighton to AG Prop 114 So for the same reasons BA is also straighton to AH And since angle DBC is equal to FBA for they are both rightangles let ABC have been added to both Thus the whole angle DBA is equal to the whole an gle FBC And since DB is equal to BC and FB to BA the two straightlines DB BA are equal to the 46STOIQEIWN a ELEMENTS BOOK 1 two straightlines CB BF respectively And angle DBA is equal to angle FBC Thus the base AD is equal to the base FC and the triangle ABD is equal to the triangle FBC Prop 14 And parallelogram BL is double the area of triangle ABD For they have the same base BD and are between the same parallels BD and AL Prop 141 And square GB is double the area of triangle FBC For again they have the same base FB and are between the same parallels FB and GC Prop 141 And the doubles of equal things are equal to one another Thus the parallelogram BL is also equal to the square GB So similarly AE and BK being joined the parallelogram CL can be shown to be equal to the square HC Thus the whole square BDEC is equal to the sum of the two squares GB and HC And the square BDEC is described on BC and the squares GB and HC on BA and AC respectively Thus the square on the side BC is equal to the sum of the squares on the sides BA and AC F H K A C B G D L E Thus in rightangled triangles the square on the side subtending the rightangle is equal to the sum of the squares on the sides surrounding the rightangle Which is the very thing it was required to show The Greek text has F B BC which is obviously a mistake This is an additional common notion 47STOIQEIWN a ELEMENTS BOOK 1 mh Proposition 48 If the square on one of the sides of a triangle is equal to the sum of the squares on the two remaining sides of the triangle then the angle contained by the two remain ing sides of the triangle is a rightangle A B D C For let the square on one of the sides BC of triangle ABC be equal to the sum of the squares on the sides BA and AC I say that angle BAC is a rightangle For let AD have been drawn from point A at right angles to the straightline AC Prop 111 and let AD have been made equal to BA Prop 13 and let DC have been joined Since DA is equal to AB the square on DA is thus also equal to the square on AB Let the square on AC have been added to both Thus the sum of the squares on DA and AC is equal to the sum of the squares on BA and AC But the square on DC is equal to the sum of the squares on DA and AC For an gle DAC is a rightangle Prop 147 But the square on BC is equal to sum of the squares on BA and AC For that was assumed Thus the square on DC is equal to the square on BC So side DC is also equal to side BC And since DA is equal to AB and AC is com mon the two straightlines DA AC are equal to the two straightlines BA AC And the base DC is equal to the base BC Thus angle DAC is equal to angle BAC Prop 18 But DAC is a rightangle Thus BAC is also a rightangle Thus if the square on one of the sides of a triangle is equal to the sum of the squares on the remaining two sides of the triangle then the angle contained by the re maining two sides of the triangle is a rightangle Which is the very thing it was required to show Here use is made of the additional common notion that the squares of equal things are themselves equal Later on the inverse notion is used 48ELEMENTS BOOK 2 Fundamentals of Geometric Algebra 49STOIQEIWN b ELEMENTS BOOK 2 V Oroi Denitions 1 Any rectangular parallelogram is said to be con tained by the two straightlines containing the right angle 2 And in any parallelogrammic gure let any one whatsoever of the parallelograms about its diagonal taken with its two complements be called a gnomon a Proposition 1 If there are two straightlines and one of them is cut into any number of pieces whatsoever then the rectangle contained by the two straightlines is equal to the sum of the rectangles contained by the uncut straightline and every one of the pieces of the cut straightline H A B D E C G F K L Let A and BC be the two straightlines and let BC be cut at random at points D and E I say that the rect angle contained by A and BC is equal to the rectangles contained by A and BD by A and DE and nally by A and EC For let BF have been drawn from point B at right angles to BC Prop 111 and let BG be made equal to A Prop 13 and let GH have been drawn through point G parallel to BC Prop 131 and let DK EL and CH have been drawn through points D E and C respectively parallel to BG Prop 131 So the rectangle BH is equal to the rectangles BK DL and EH And BH is the rectangle contained by A and BC For it is contained by GB and BC and BG is equal to A And BK is the rectangle contained by A and BD For it is contained by GB and BD and BG is equal to A And DL is the rectangle contained by A and DE For DK that is to say BG Prop 134 is equal to A Similarly EH is also the rectangle con tained by A and EC Thus the rectangle contained by A and BC is equal to the rectangles contained by A 50STOIQEIWN b ELEMENTS BOOK 2 and BD by A and DE and nally by A and EC Thus if there are two straightlines and one of them is cut into any number of pieces whatsoever then the rectangle contained by the two

BC plus the rectangle contained by BA and AC is equal to the square on AB For let the square ADEB have been described on AB Prop 146 and let CF have been drawn through C parallel to either of AD or BE Prop 131 So the square AE is equal to the rectangles AF and CE And AE is the square on AB And AF is the rectangle contained by the straightlines BA and AC For it is contained by DA and AC and AD is equal to AB And CE is the rectangle contained by AB and BC For BE is equal to AB Thus the rectangle con tained by BA and AC plus the rectangle contained by AB and BC is equal to the square on AB Thus if a straightline is cut at random then the sum of the rectangles contained by the whole straight line and each of the pieces of the straightline is equal to the square on the whole Which is the very

A C F D E For let the straightline AB have been cut at random at point C I say that the rectangle contained by AB and BC is equal to the rectangle contained by AC and CB plus the square on BC For let the square CDEB have been described on CB Prop 146 and let ED have been drawn through to F and let AF have been drawn through A parallel to either of CD or BE Prop 131 So the rectangle AE is equal to the rectangle AD and the square CE And AE is the rectangle contained by AB and BC For it is contained by AB and BE and BE is equal to BC And AD is the rectangle contained by AC and CB For DC is equal to CB And DB is the square on CB Thus the rectangle contained by AB and BC is equal to the rectangle contained by AC and CB plus the square on BC Thus if a straightline is cut at random then the rect angle contained by the whole straightline and one of the pieces of the straightline is equal to the rectangle contained by both of the pieces and the square on the aforementioned piece Which is the very thing it was required to show This proposition is a geometric version of the algebraic identity a b a a b a2 d Proposition 4 If a straightline is cut at random then the square on the whole

straightline AB have been cut at random at point C I say that the square on AB is equal to the sum of the squares on AC and CB and twice the rectangle contained by AC and CB For let the square ADEB have been described on AB Prop 146 and let BD have been joined and let CF have been drawn through C parallel to either of AD or EB Prop 131 and let HK have been drawn through G parallel to either of AB or DE Prop 131 And since CF is parallel to AD and BD has fallen across them the external angle CGB is equal to the internal and opposite angle ADB Prop 129 But ADB is equal to ABD since the side BA is also equal to AD Prop 15 Thus angle CGB is also equal to GBC So the side BC is equal to the side CG Prop 16 But CB is equal to GK and CG to KB Prop 134 Thus GK is also equal to KB Thus CGKB is equilateral So I say that it is also rightangled For since CG is parallel to BK and the straightline CB has fallen across them the angles KBC and GCB are thus equal to two rightangles Prop 129 But KBC is a rightangle Thus BCG is also a right angle So the opposite angles CGK and GKB are also rightangles Prop 134 Thus CGKB is rightangled And it was also shown to be equilateral Thus it is a square And it is on CB So for the same reasons HF is also a square And it is on HG that is to say on AC Prop 134 Thus the squares HF and KC are on AC and CB respectively And the rectangle AG is equal to the rectangle GE Prop 143 And AG is the rectangle contained by AC and CB For GC is equal to CB Thus GE is also equal to the rectangle contained by AC and CB Thus the rectangles AG and GE are equal to twice the rectangle contained by AC and CB And HF and CK are the squares on AC and CB respectively Thus the four gures HF CK AG and GE are equal to the sum of the squares on 53STOIQEIWN b ELEMENTS BOOK 2 AC and BC and twice the rectangle contained by AC and CB But the gures HF CK AG and GE are equivalent to the whole of ADEB which is the square on AB Thus the square on AB is equal to the sum of the squares on AC and CB and twice the rectangle contained by AC and CB Thus if a straightline is cut at random then the square on the whole straightline is equal to the sum of the squares on the pieces of the straightline and twice the rectangle contained by the pieces Which is the very thing it was required to show This proposition is a geometric version of the algebraic identity a b2 a2 b2

through D parallel to either of CE or BF Prop 131 and again let KM have been drawn through H parallel to either of AB or EF Prop 131 and again let AK have been drawn through A parallel to either of CL or BM Prop 131 And since the comple ment CH is equal to the complement HF Prop 143 let the square DM have been added to both Thus the whole rectangle CM is equal to the whole rect angle DF But rectangle CM is equal to rectangle AL since AC is also equal to CB Prop 136 Thus rectangle AL is also equal to rectangle DF Let rect angle CH have been added to both Thus the whole rectangle AH is equal to the gnomon NOP But AH 54STOIQEIWN b ELEMENTS BOOK 2 is the rectangle contained by AD and DB For DH is equal to DB Thus the gnomon NOP is also equal to the rectangle contained by AD and DB Let LG which is equal to the square on CD have been added to both Thus the gnomon NOP and the square LG are equal to the rectangle contained by AD and DB and the square on CD But the gnomon NOP and the square LG is equivalent to the whole square CEFB which is on CB Thus the rectangle contained by AD and DB plus the square on CD is equal to the square on CB Thus if a straightline is cut into equal

2 through A parallel to either of CL or DM Prop 131 Therefore since AC is equal to CB rectangle AL is also equal to rectangle CH Prop 136 But rectan gle CH is equal to rectangle HF Prop 143 Thus rectangle AL is also equal to rectangle HF Let rect angle CM have been added to both Thus the whole rectangle AM is equal to the gnomon NOP But AM is the rectangle contained by AD and DB For DM is equal to DB Thus gnomon NOP is also equal to the rectangle contained by AD and DB Let LG which is equal to the square on BC have been added to both Thus the rectangle contained by AD and DB plus the square on CB is equal to the gnomon NOP and the square LG But the gnomon NOP and the square LG is equivalent to the whole square CEFD which is on CD Thus the rectangle contained by AD and DB plus the square on CB is equal to the square on CD Thus if a straightline is cut in half and any straight line added to it straighton then the rectangle contained by the whole straightline with the straightline hav ing being added and the straightline having being added plus the square on half of the original straight line is equal to the square on the sum of half of the original straightline

rectangle contained by AB and 56STOIQEIWN b ELEMENTS BOOK 2 BC and the square on CA For let the square ADEB have been described on AB Prop 146 and let the rest of the gure have been drawn Therefore since rectangle AG is equal to rectan gle GE Prop 143 let the square CF have been added to both Thus the whole rectangle AF is equal to the whole rectangle CE Thus rectangle AF plus rectangle CE is double rectangle AF But rectan gle AF plus rectangle CE is the gnomon KLM and the square CF Thus the gnomon KLM and the square CF is double the rectangle AF But double the rect angle AF is also twice the rectangle contained by AB and BC For BF is equal to BC Thus the gnomon KLM and the square CF are equal to twice the rect angle contained by AB and BC Let DG which is the square on AC have been added to both Thus the gnomon KLM and the squares BG and GD are equal to twice the rectangle contained by AB and BC and the square on AC But the gnomon KLM and the squares BG and GD is equivalent to the whole of ADEB and CF which are the squares on AB and BC respectively Thus the sum of the squares on AB and BC is equal to twice the rectangle contained by AB and BC and the square on AC Thus if a straightline is cut at random then the sum of the squares on the whole straightline and one of the pieces of the straightline is equal to twice the rect angle contained by the whole and the said piece and the square on the remaining piece Which is the very thing it was required to show This proposition is a geometric version of the algebraic identity a b2 a2 2 a b a b2 h Proposition 8 If a straightline is cut at random then four times the rectangle contained by the whole straightline and one of the pieces of the straightline plus the square on the remaining piece is equal to the square described on the whole and the former piece as on one complete straight line For let any straightline AB have been cut at random at point C I say that four times the rectangle contained by AB and BC plus the square on AC is equal to the square described on AB and BC as on one complete straightline For let BD have been produced in a straightline with the straightline AB and let BD be made equal to CB Prop 13 and let the square AEFD have been described on AD Prop 146 and let the rest of the gure have been drawn double 57STOIQEIWN b ELEMENTS BOOK 2 U A C B D N P Q G K R T E H L F S M O Therefore since CB is equal to BD but CB is equal to GK Prop 134 and BD to KN Prop 134 GK is thus also equal to KN So for the same reasons QR is equal to RP And since BC is equal to BD and GK to KN square CK is thus also equal to square KD and square GR to square RN Prop 136 But square CK is equal to square RN For they are comple ments in the parallelogram CP Prop 143 Thus square KD is also equal to square GR Thus the four squares DK CK GR and RN are equal to one another Thus the four taken together are quadruple square CK Again since CB is equal to BD but BD is equal to BKthat is to say CGand CB is equal to GKthat is to say GQCG is thus also equal to GQ And since CG is equal to GQ and QR to RP rectan gle AG is also equal to rectangle MQ and rectangle QL to rectangle RF Prop 136 But rectangle MQ is equal to rectangle QL For they are complements in the parallelogram ML Prop 143 Thus rectangle AG is also equal to rectangle RF Thus the four rect angles AG MQ QL and RF are equal to one another Thus the four taken together are quadruple rectan gle AG And it was also shown that the four squares CK KD GR and RN taken together are quadruple square CK Thus the eight gures taken together which comprise the gnomon ST U are quadruple rect angle AK And since AK is the rectangle contained by AB and BD for BK is equal to BD four times the rectangle contained by AB and BD is quadruple rect angle AK But the gnomon ST U was also shown to be equal to quadruple rectangle AK Thus four times the rectangle contained by AB and BD is equal to the gnomon ST U Let OH which is equal to the square on AC have been added to both Thus four times the rect angle contained by AB and BD plus the square on AC is equal to the gnomon ST U and the square OH But 58STOIQEIWN b ELEMENTS BOOK 2 the gnomon ST U and the square OH is equivalent to the whole square AEFD which is on AD Thus four times the rectangle contained by AB and BD plus the square on AC is equal to the square on AD And BD is equal to BC Thus four times the rectangle con tained by AB and BC plus the square on AC is equal to the square on AD that is to say the square described on AB and BC as on one complete straightline Thus if a straightline is cut at random then four times the rectangle contained by the whole straightline and one of the pieces of the straightline plus the square on the remaining piece is equal to the square described on the whole and the former piece as on one complete straightline Which is the very thing it was required to show This proposition is a geometric version of the algebraic identity 4 a b a b2

EA and EB have been joined And let DF have been drawn through point D parallel to EC Prop 131 and let FG have been drawn through point F parallel to AB Prop 131 And let AF have been joined And since AC is equal to CE the angle EAC is also equal to the angle AEC Prop 15 And since the angle at C is a rightangle the sum of the remaining angles of tri angle AEC EAC and AEC is thus equal to one right 59STOIQEIWN b ELEMENTS BOOK 2 angle Prop 132 And they are equal Thus angles CEA and CAE are each half a rightangle So for the same reasons angles CEB and EBC are also each half a rightangle Thus the whole angle AEB is a rightangle And since GEF is half a rightangle and EGF is a rightanglefor it is equal to the internal and opposite angle ECB Prop 129the remaining an gle EFG is thus half a rightangle Prop 132 Thus angle GEF is equal to EFG So the side EG is also equal to the side GF Prop 16 Again since the an gle at B is half a rightangle and angle FDB is a rightanglefor again it is equal to the internal and op posite angle ECB Prop 129the remaining angle BFD is half a rightangle Prop 132 Thus the angle at B is equal to DFB So the side FD is also equal to the side DB Prop 16 And since AC is equal to CE the square on AC is also equal to the square on CE Thus the sum of the squares on AC and CE is dou ble the square on AC And the square on EA is equal to the sum of the squares on AC and CE For angle ACE is a rightangle Prop 147 Thus the square on EA is double the square on AC Again since EG is equal to GF the square on EG is also equal to the square on GF Thus the sum of the squares on EG and GF is double the square on GF And the square on EF is equal to the sum of the squares on EG and GF Prop 147 Thus the square on EF is double the square on GF And GF is equal to CD Prop 134 Thus the square on EF is double the square on CD And the square on EA is also double the square on AC Thus the sum of the squares on AE and EF is double the sum of the squares on AC and CD And the square on AF is equal to the sum of the squares on AE and EF For the angle AEF is a rightangle Prop 147 Thus the square on AF is double the sum of the squares on AC and CD And the sum of the squares on AD and DF is equal to the square on AF For the angle at D is a rightangle Prop 147 Thus the sum of the squares on AD and DF is double the sum of the squares on AC and CD And DF is equal to DB Thus the sum of the squares on AD and DB is double the sum of the squares on AC and CD Thus if a straightline is cut into equal and unequal pieces then the sum of the squares on the unequal pieces of the whole straightline is double the sum of the square on half the straightline and the square on the difference between the equal and unequal pieces Which is the very thing it was required to show

the straightline and the square described on the sum of half the straightline and straightline having been added as on one complete straightline G E A C B F D For let any straightline AB have been cut in half at point C and let any straightline BD have been added to it straighton I say that the sum of the squares on AD and DB is double the sum of the squares on AC and CD For let CE have been drawn from point C at right angles to AB Prop 111 and let it be made equal to each of AC and CB Prop 13 and let EA and EB have been joined And let EF have been drawn through E parallel to AD Prop 131 and let FD have been drawn through D parallel to CE Prop 131 And since some straightline EF falls across the parallel straightlines EC and FD the internal angles CEF and EFD are thus equal to two rightangles Prop 129 Thus FEB and EFD are less than two rightangles And straightlines produced from internal angles whose sum is less than two rightangles meet together Post 5 Thus being pro duced in the direction of B and D the straightlines EB and FD will meet Let them have been produced and let them meet together at G and let AG have been joined And since AC is equal to CE angle EAC is also equal to angle AEC Prop 15 And the angle at C is a rightangle Thus EAC and AEC are each half a rightangle Prop 132 So for the same rea sons CEB and EBC are also each half a rightangle Thus angle AEB is a rightangle And since EBC is half a rightangle DBG is thus also half a right angle Prop 115 And BDG is also a rightangle For it is equal to DCE For they are alternate angles 61STOIQEIWN b ELEMENTS BOOK 2 Prop 129 Thus the remaining angle DGB is half a rightangle Thus DGB is equal to DBG So side BD is also equal to side GD Prop 16 Again since EGF is half a rightangle and the angle at F is a rightangle for it is equal to the opposite angle at C Prop 134 the remaining angle FEG is thus half a rightangle Thus angle EGF is equal to FEG So the side GF is also equal to the side EF Prop 16 And since EC is equal to CA the square on EC is also equal to the square on CA Thus the sum of the squares on EC and CA is double the square on CA And the square on EA is equal to the sum of the squares on EC and CA Prop 147 Thus the square on EA is double the square on AC Again since FG is equal to EF the square on FG is also equal to the square on FE Thus the sum of the squares on GF and FE is dou ble the square on EF And the square on EG is equal to the sum of the squares on GF and FE Prop 147 Thus the square on EG is double the square on EF And EF is equal to CD Prop 134 Thus the square on EG is double the square on CD But it was also shown that the square on EA is double the square on AC Thus the sum of the squares on AE and EG is double the sum of the squares on AC and CD And the square on AG is equal to the sum of the squares on AE and EG Prop 147 Thus the square on AG is double the sum of the squares on AC and CD And the sum of the squares on AD and DG is equal to the square on AG Prop 147 Thus the sum of the squares on AD and DG is double the sum of the squares on AC and CD And DG is equal to DB Thus the sum of the squares on AD and DB is double the sum of the squares on AC and CD Thus if a straightline is cut in half and any straight line added to it straighton then the sum of the square on the whole straightline with the straightline hav ing been added and the square on the straightline having been added is double the sum of the square on half the straightline and the square described on the sum of half the straightline and straightline having been added as on one

the rectangle contained by AB and BH equal to the square on AH For since the straightline AC has been cut in half at E and FA has been added to it the rectangle contained by CF and FA plus the square on AE is thus equal to the square on EF Prop 26 And EF is equal to EB Thus the rectangle contained by CF and FA plus the square on AE is equal to the square on EB But the sum of the squares on BA and AE is equal to the square on EB For the angle at A is a rightangle Prop 147 Thus the rectangle contained by CF and FA plus the square on AE is equal to the sum of the squares on BA and AE Let the square on AE have been subtracted from both Thus the remaining rectan gle contained by CF and FA is equal to the square on AB And FK is the rectangle contained by CF and FA For AF is equal to FG And AD is the square on AB Thus the rectangle FK is equal to the square AD Let rectangle AK have been subtracted from both Thus the remaining square FH is equal to the rectan gle HD And HD is the rectangle contained by AB and BH For AB is equal to BD And FH is the square on AH Thus the rectangle contained by AB 63STOIQEIWN b ELEMENTS BOOK 2 and BH is equal to the square on HA Thus the given straightline AB has been cut at point H such as to make the rectangle contained by AB and BH equal to the square on HA Which is the very thing it was required to do This manner of cutting a straightlineso that the ratio of the whole to the larger piece is equal to the ratio of the larger to the smaller pieceis sometimes called the Golden Section ib Proposition 12 In obtuseangled triangles the square on the side sub tending the obtuse angle is greater than the sum of the squares on the sides containing the obtuse angle by twice the rectangle contained by one of the sides around the obtuse angle to which a perpendicular straightline falls and the straightline cut off outside the triangle by the perpendicular straightline towards the obtuse angle B D A C Let ABC be an obtuseangled triangle having the an gle BAC obtuse And let BD be drawn from point B perpendicular to CA produced Prop 112 I say that the square on BC is greater than the sum of the squares on BA and AC by twice the rectangle contained by CA and AD For since the straightline CD has been cut at ran dom at point A the square on DC is thus equal to the sum of the squares on CA and AD and twice the rectangle contained by CA and AD Prop 24 Let the square on DB have been added to both Thus the sum of the squares on CD and DB is equal to the sum of the squares on CA AD and DB and twice the rect angle contained by CA and AD But the square on CB is equal to the sum of the squares on CD and DB For the angle at D is a rightangle Prop 147 And the square on AB is equal to the sum of the squares on AD and DB Prop 147 Thus the square on CB is equal to the sum of the squares on CA and AB and twice the rectangle contained by CA and AD So the square on CB is greater than the sum of the squares on 64STOIQEIWN b ELEMENTS BOOK 2 CA and AB by twice the rectangle contained by CA and AD Thus in obtuseangled triangles the square on the side subtending the obtuse angle is greater than the sum of the squares on the sides containing the obtuse an gle by twice the rectangle contained by one of the sides around the obtuse angle to which a perpendicu lar straightline falls and the straightline cut off out side the triangle by the perpendicular straightline to wards the obtuse angle Which is the very thing it was required to show This proposition is equivalent to the wellknown cosine formula BC 2 AB 2 AC 2 2 AB AC cos BAC since cos BAC ADAB ig Proposition 13 In acuteangled triangles the square on the side sub tending the acute angle is less than the sum of the squares on the sides containing the acute angle by twice the rectangle contained by one of the sides around the acute angle to which a perpendicular straightline falls and the straightline cut off inside the triangle by the perpendicular straightline towards the acute angle B D C A Let ABC be an acuteangled triangle having the an gle at point B acute And let AD have been drawn from point A perpendicular to BC Prop 112 I say that the square on AC is less than the sum of the squares on CB and BA by twice the rectangle contained by CB and BD For since the straightline CB has been cut at ran dom at point D the sum of the squares on CB and BD is thus equal to twice the rectangle contained by CB and BD and the square on DC Prop 27 Let the square on DA have been added to both Thus the sum of the squares on CB BD and DA is equal to twice the rectangle contained by CB and BD and the sum of the squares on AD and DC But the square on AB is equal to the sum of the squares on BD and DA For the angle at point D is a rightangle Prop 147 65STOIQEIWN b ELEMENTS BOOK 2 And the square on AC is equal to the sum of the squares on AD and DC Prop 147 Thus the sum of the squares on CB and BA is equal to the square on AC and twice the rectangle contained by CB and BD So the square on AC alone is less than the sum of the squares on CB and BA by twice the rectangle contained by CB and BD Thus in acuteangled triangles the square on the side subtending the acute angle is less than the sum of the squares on the sides containing the acute angle by twice the rectangle contained by one of the sides around the acute angle to which a perpendicular straightline falls and the straightline cut off inside the triangle by the perpendicular straightline towards the acute angle Which is the very thing it was required to show This proposition is equivalent to the wellknown cosine formula AC 2 AB 2 BC 2 2 AB BC cos ABC since cos ABC BDAB id Proposition 14 To construct a square equal to a given rectilinear g ure H A B C G E F D Let A be the given rectilinear gure So it is required to construct a square equal to the rectilinear gure A For let the rightangled parallelogram BD equal to the rectilinear gure A have been constructed Prop 145 Therefore if BE is equal to ED then that which was prescribed has taken place For the square BD equal to the rectilinear gure A has been constructed And if not then one of the straightlines BE or ED is greater than the other Let BE be greater and let it have been produced to F and let EF be made equal to ED Prop 13 And let BF have been cut in half at point G Prop 110 And with center G and radius one of the straightlines GB or GF let the semicircle BHF have been drawn And let DE have been produced to H and let GH have been joined Therefore since the straightline BF has been cut equally at G and unequally at Ethe rectangle con 66STOIQEIWN b ELEMENTS BOOK 2 tained by BE and EF plus the square on EG is thus equal to the square on GF Prop 25 And GF is equal to GH Thus the rectangle contained by BE and EF plus the square on GE is equal to the square on GH And the sum of the squares on HE and EG is equal to the square on GH Prop 147 Thus the rectangle contained by BE and EF plus the square on GE is equal to the sum of the squares on HE and EG Let the square on GE have been taken from both Thus the remaining rectangle contained by BE and EF is equal to the square on EH But BD is the rectangle contained by BE and EF For EF is equal to ED Thus the par allelogram BD is equal to the square on HE And BD is equal to the rectilinear gure A Thus the rectilin ear gure A is also equal to the square which can be described on EH Thus a squarenamely that which can be de scribed on EHhas been constructed equal to the given rectilinear gure A Which is the very thing it was re quired to do 6768ELEMENTS BOOK 3 Fundamentals of Plane Geometry Involving Circles 69STOIQEIWN g ELEMENTS BOOK 3 V Oroi Denitions 1 Equal circles are circles whose diameters are equal or whose distances from the centers to the cir cumferences are equal ie whose radii are equal 2 A straightline said to touch a circle is any straight line which meeting the circle and being produced does not cut the circle 3 Circles said to touch one another are any circles which meeting one another do not cut one another 4 In a circle straightlines are said to be equally far from the center when the perpendiculars drawn to them from the center are equal 5 And that straightline is said to be further from the center on which the greater perpendicular falls from the center 6 A segment of a circle is the gure contained by a straightline and a circumference of a circle 7 And the angle of a segment is that contained by a straightline and a circumference of a circle 8 And the angle in a segment is the angle contained by the joined straightlines when any point is taken on the circumference of a segment and straightlines are joined from it to the ends of the straightline which is the base of the segment 9 And when the straightlines containing an angle cut off some circumference the angle is said to stand upon that circumference 10 And a sector of a circle is the gure contained by the straightlines surrounding an angle and the circum ference cut off by them when the angle is constructed at the center of a circle 11 Similar segments of circles are those accepting equal angles or in which the angles are equal to one an other a Proposition 1 To nd the center of a given circle Let ABC be the given circle So it is required to nd the center of circle ABC Let some straightline AB have been drawn through ABC at random and let AB have been cut in half at point D Prop 19 And let DC have been drawn from D at rightangles to AB Prop 111 And let CD have been drawn through to E And let CE have been cut in half at F Prop 19 I say that point F is the center of the circle ABC For if not then if possible let G be the center of the circle and let GA GD and GB have been joined And since AD is equal to DB and DG is common the two 70STOIQEIWN g ELEMENTS BOOK 3 straightlines AD DG are equal to the two straight lines BD DG respectively And the base GA is equal to the base GB For they are both radii Thus angle ADG is equal to angle GDB Prop 18 And when a straightline stood upon another straightline make ad jacent angles which are equal to one another each of the equal angles is a rightangle Def 110 Thus GDB is a rightangle And FDB is also a rightangle Thus FDB is equal to GDB the greater to the lesser The very thing is impossible Thus point G is not the center of the circle ABC So similarly we can show that neither is any other point except F D A G B F C E Thus point F is the center of the circle ABC Pri sma Corollary So from this it is manifest that if any straightline in a circle cuts any other straightline in half and at rightangles then the center of the circle is on the for mer straightline Which is the very thing it was required to do The Greek text has GD DB which is obviously a mistake b Proposition 2 If two points are taken at random on the circumfer ence of a circle then the straightline joining the points will fall inside the circle Let ABC be a circle and let two points A and B have been taken at random on its circumference I say that the straightline joining A to B will fall inside the circle For if not then if possible let it fall outside the circle like AEB in the gure And let the center of the circle ABC have been found Prop 31 and let it be at point D And let DA and DB have been joined and let DFE have been drawn through Therefore since DA is equal to DB the angle DAE 71STOIQEIWN g ELEMENTS BOOK 3 is thus also equal to DBE Prop 15 And since in tri angle DAE the one side AEB has been produced an gle DEB is thus greater than DAE Prop 116 And DAE is equal to DBE Prop 15 Thus DEB is greater than DBE And the greater angle is subtended by the greater side Prop 119 Thus DB is greater than DE And DB is equal to DF Thus DF is greater than DE the lesser than the greater The very thing is impossible Thus the straightline joining A to B will not fall outside the circle So similarly we can show that neither will it fall on the circumference itself Thus it will fall inside the circle B D C E F A Thus if two points are taken at random on the cir cumference of a circle then the straightline joining the points will fall inside the circle Which is the very thing it was required to show g Proposition 3 In a circle if any straightline through the center cuts in half any straightline not through the center then it also cuts it at rightangles And conversely if it cuts it at rightangles then it also cuts it in half Let ABC be a circle and within it let some straight line through the center CD cut in half some straightline not through the center AB at the point F I say that CD also cuts AB at rightangles For let the center of the circle ABC have been found Prop 31 and let it be at point E and let EA and EB have been joined And since AF is equal to FB and FE is common two sides of triangle AFE are equal to two sides of triangle BFE And the base EA is equal to the base EB Thus angle AFE is equal to angle BFE Prop 18 And when a straightline stood upon another straight line makes adjacent angles which are equal to one an other each of the equal angles is a rightangle Def 110 Thus AFE and BFE are each rightangles Thus the 72STOIQEIWN g ELEMENTS BOOK 3 straightline CD which is through the center and cuts in half the straightline AB which is not through the center also cuts AB at rightangles D A E F B C And so let CD cut AB at rightangles I say that it also cuts AB in half That is to say that AF is equal to FB For with the same construction since EA is equal to EB angle EAF is also equal to EBF Prop 15 And the rightangle AFE is also equal to the rightangle BFE Thus EAF and EFB are two triangles having two angles equal to two angles and one side equal to one sidenamely their common side EF subtend ing one of the equal angles Thus they will also have the remaining sides equal to the corresponding remaining sides Prop 126 Thus AF is equal to FB Thus in a circle if any straightline through the cen ter cuts in half any straightline not through the center then it also cuts it at rightangles And conversely if it cuts it at rightangles then it also cuts it in half Which is the very thing it was required to show d Proposition 4 In a circle if two straightlines which are not through the center cut one another then they do not cut one an other in half Let ABCD be a circle and within it let two straight lines AC and BD which are not through the center cut one another at point E I say that they do not cut one another in half For if possible let them cut one another in half such that AE is equal to EC and BE to ED And let the center of the circle ABCD have been found Prop 31 and let it be at point F and let FE have been joined Therefore since some straightline through the center FE cuts in half some straightline not through the cen ter AC it also cuts it at rightangles Prop 33 Thus FEA is a rightangle Again since some straightline FE 73STOIQEIWN g ELEMENTS BOOK 3 cuts in half some straightline BD it also cuts it at right angles Prop 33 Thus FEB is a rightangle But FEA was also shown to be a rightangle Thus FEA is equal to FEB the lesser to the greater The very thing is impossible Thus AC and BD do not cut one another in half E F C B D A Thus in a circle if two straightlines which are not through the center cut one another then they do not cut one another in half Which is the very thing it was re quired to show e Proposition 5 If two circles cut one another then they will not have the same center D A C E F G B For let the two circles ABC and CDG cut one another at points B and C I say that they will not have the same center For if possible let E be the common center and let EC have been joined and let EFG have been drawn through the two circles at random And since point E is the center of the circle ABC EC is equal to EF Again since point E is the center of the circle CDG EC is equal to EG But EC was also shown to be equal to EF Thus EF is also equal to EG the lesser to the greater The very thing is impossible Thus point E is not 74STOIQEIWN g ELEMENTS BOOK 3 the common center of the circles ABC and CDG Thus if two circles cut one another then they will not have the same center Which is the very thing it was required to show Proposition 6 If two circles touch one another then they will not have the same center C A D B F E For let the two circles ABC and CDE touch one an other at point C I say that they will not have the same center For if possible let F be the common center and let FC have been joined and let FEB have been drawn through the two circles at random Therefore since point F is the center of the circle ABC FC is equal to FB Again since point F is the center of the circle CDE FC is equal to FE But FC was shown to be equal to FB Thus FE is also equal to FB the lesser to the greater The very thing is impos sible Thus point F is not the common center of the circles ABC and CDE Thus if two circles touch one another then they will not have the same center Which is the very thing it was required to show z Proposition 7 If some point which is not the center of the circle is taken on the diameter of a circle and some straight lines radiate from the point towards the circumference of the circle then the greatest straightline will be that on which the center lies and the least the remainder of the same diameter And for the others a straight line nearer to the straightline through the center is always greater than a straightline further away And only two equal straightlines will radiate from the point towards the circumference of the circle one on each 75STOIQEIWN g ELEMENTS BOOK 3 side of the least straightline H A B G F D E C K Let ABCD be a circle and let AD be its diameter and let some point F which is not the center of the circle have been taken on AD Let E be the center of the circle And let some straightlines FB FC and FG radiate from F towards the circumference of circle ABCD I say that FA is the greatest straightline FD the least and of the others FB is greater than FC and FC than FG For let BE CE and GE have been joined And since for every triangle any two sides are greater than the remaining side Prop 120 EB and EF is thus greater than BF And AE is equal to BE thus BE and EF is equal to AF Thus AF is greater than BF Again since BE is equal to CE and FE is common the two straightlines BE EF are equal to the two straight lines CE EF respectively But angle BEF is also greater than angle CEF Thus the base BF is greater than the base CF Thus the base BF is greater than the base CF Prop 124 So for the same reasons CF is also greater than FG Again since GF and FE are greater than EG Prop 120 and EG is equal to ED GF and FE are thus greater than ED Let EF have been taken from both Thus the remainder GF is greater than the re mainder FD Thus FA is the greatest straightline FD the least and FB is greater than FC and FC than FG I also say that from point F only two equal straight lines will radiate towards the circumference of circle ABCD one on each side of the least straightline FD For let the angle FEH equal to angle GEF have been constructed on the straightline EF at the point E on it Prop 123 and let FH have been joined There fore since GE is equal to EH and EF is common 76STOIQEIWN g ELEMENTS BOOK 3 the two straightlines GE EF are equal to the two straightlines HE EF respectively And angle GEF is equal to angle HEF Thus the base FG is equal to the base FH Prop 14 So I say that another straight line equal to FG will not radiate towards the circumfer ence of the circle from point F For if possible let FK so radiate And since FK is equal to FG but FH is equal to FG FK is thus also equal to FH the nearer to the straightline through the center equal to the fur ther away The very thing is impossible Thus another straightline equal to GF will not radiate from the point F towards the circumference of the circle Thus there is only one such straightline Thus if some point which is not the center of the circle is taken on the diameter of a circle and some straightlines radiate from the point towards the circum ference of the circle then the greatest straightline will be that on which the center lies and the least the remainder of the same diameter And for the oth ers a straightline nearer to the straightline through the center is always greater than a straightline further away And only two equal straightlines will radiate from the same point towards the circumference of the circle one on each side of the least straightline Which is the very thing it was required to show Presumably in an angular sense This is not proved except by reference to the gure h Proposition 8 If some point is taken outside a circle and some straightlines are drawn from the point to the circum ference of the circle one of which passes through the center the remainder being random then for the straightlines radiating towards the concave part of the circumference the greatest is that passing through the center For the others a straightline nearer to the straightline through the center is always greater than one further away For the straightlines radiating towards the convex part of the circumference the least is that between the point and the diameter For the others a straightline nearer to the least straightline is always less than one further away And only two equal straight lines will radiate from the point towards the circum ference of the circle one on each side of the least straightline Let ABC be a circle and let some point D have been taken outside ABC and from it let some straightlines DA DE DF and DC have been drawn through the circle and let DA be through the center I say that for the straightlines radiating towards the concave part of 77STOIQEIWN g ELEMENTS BOOK 3 the circumference AEFC the greatest is the one pass ing through the center namely AD and that DE is greater than DF and DF than DC For the straightlines radiating towards the convex part of the circumference HLKG the least is the one between the point and the di ameter AG namely DG and a straightline nearer to the least straightline DG is always less than one far ther away so that DK is less than DL and DL than than DH C H L K G M A E F B D N For let the center of the circle have been found Prop 31 and let it be at point M Prop 31 And let ME MF MC MK ML and MH have been joined And since AM is equal to EM let MD have been added to both Thus AD is equal to EM and MD But EM and MD is greater than ED Prop 120 Thus AD is also greater than ED Again since ME is equal to MF and MD is common the straightlines EM MD are thus equal to FM MD And angle EMD is greater than angle FMD Thus the base ED is greater than the base FD Prop 124 So similarly we can show that FD is also greater than CD Thus AD is the greatest straightline and DE is greater than DF and DF than DC And since MK and KD is greater than MD Prop 120 and MG is equal to MK the remainder KD is thus greater than the remainder GD So GD is less than KD And since in triangle MLD the two inter nal straightlines MK and KD were constructed on one of the sides MD then MK and KD are thus less than ML and LD Prop 121 And MK is equal to ML Thus the remainder DK is less than the remainder DL So similarly we can show that DL is also less than DH Thus DG is the least straightline and DK is less than DL and DL than DH I also say that only two equal straightlines will radi 78STOIQEIWN g ELEMENTS BOOK 3 ate from point D towards the circumference of the cir cle one on each side on the least straightline DG Let the angle DMB equal to angle KMD have been constructed on the straightline MD at the point M on it Prop 123 and let DB have been joined And since MK is equal to MB and MD is common the two straightlines KM MD are equal to the two straight lines BM MD respectively And angle KMD is equal to angle BMD Thus the base DK is equal to the base DB Prop 14 So I say that another straight line equal to DK will not radiate towards the circum ference of the circle from point D For if possible let such a straightline radiate and let it be DN There fore since DK is equal to DN but DK is equal to DB then DB is thus also equal to DN so that a straight line nearer to the least straightline DG is equal to one further away The very thing was shown to be im possible Thus not more than two equal straightlines will radiate towards the circumference of circle ABC from point D one on each side of the least straight line DG Thus if some point is taken outside a circle and some straightlines are drawn from the point to the circumfer ence of the circle one of which passes through the cen ter the remainder being random then for the straight lines radiating towards the concave part of the circum ference the greatest is that passing through the center For the others a straightline nearer to the straight line through the center is always greater than one fur ther away For the straightlines radiating towards the convex part of the circumference the least is that be tween the point and the diameter For the others a straightline nearer to the least straightline is always less than one further away And only two equal straight lines will radiate from the point towards the circum ference of the circle one on each side of the least straightline Which is the very thing it was required to show Presumably in an angular sense This is not proved except by reference to the gure j Proposition 9 If some point is taken inside a circle and more than two equal straightlines radiate from the point towards the circumference of the circle then the point taken is the center of the circle Let ABC be a circle and D a point inside it and let more than two equal straightlines DA DB and DC ra diate from D towards the circumference of circle ABC 79STOIQEIWN g ELEMENTS BOOK 3 I say that point D is the center of circle ABC D E B C G A K L F H For let AB and BC have been joined and then have been cut in half at points E and F respectively Prop 110 And ED and FD being joined let them have been drawn through to points G K H and L Therefore since AE is equal to EB and ED is com mon the two straightlines AE ED are equal to the two straightlines BE ED respectively And the base DA is equal to the base DB Thus angle AED is equal to angle BED Prop 18 Thus angles AED and BED are each rightangles Def 110 Thus GK cuts AB in half and at rightangles And since if some straightline in a circle cuts some other straightline in half and at rightangles then the center of the circle is on the former straightline Prop 31 corr the center of the circle is thus on GK So for the same reasons the center of circle ABC is also on HL And the straightlines GK and HL have no common point other than point D Thus point D is the center of circle ABC Thus if some point is taken inside a circle and more than two equal straightlines radiate from the point to wards the circumference of the circle then the point taken is the center of the circle Which is the very thing it was required to show i Proposition 10 A circle does not cut another circle at more than two points For if possible let the circle ABC cut the circle DEF at more than two points B G F and H And BH and BG being joined let them then have been cut in half at points K and L respectively And KC and LM be ing drawn at rightangles to BH and BG from K and L respectively Prop 111 let them then have been drawn through to points A and E respectively 80STOIQEIWN g ELEMENTS BOOK 3 B A C D E L O G M P F K N H Therefore since in circle ABC some straightline AC cuts some other straightline BH in half and at rightangles the center of circle ABC is thus on AC Prop 31 corr Again since in the same circle ABC some straightline NO cuts some other straightline BG in half and at rightangles the center of circle ABC is thus on NO Prop 31 corr And it was also shown to be on AC And the straightlines AC and NO meet at no other point than P Thus point P is the center of circle ABC So similarly we can show that P is also the center of circle DEF Thus two circles cutting one an other ABC and DEF have the same center P The very thing is impossible Prop 35 Thus a circle does not cut another circle at more than two points Which is the very thing it was required to show ia Proposition 11 If two circles touch one another internally and their centers are found then the straightline joining their cen ters being produced will fall upon the point of union of the circles For let two circles ABC and ADE touch one another internally at point A and let the center F of circle ABC have been found Prop 31 and the center G of cir cle ADE Prop 31 I say that the straightline joining G to F being produced will fall on A For if not then if possible let it fall like FGH in the gure and let AF and AG have been joined Therefore since AG and GF is greater than FA that is to say FH Prop 120 let FG have been taken from both Thus the remainder AG is greater than the re mainder GH And AG is equal to GD Thus GD is also greater than GH the lesser than the greater The very thing is impossible Thus the straightline joining F to G will not fall outside one circle but inside the other Thus it will fall upon the point of union of the circles 81STOIQEIWN g ELEMENTS BOOK 3 at point A F A B C G H E D Thus if two circles touch one another internally and their centers are found then the straightline joining their centers being produced will fall upon the point of union of the circles Which is the very thing it was required to show ib Proposition 12 If two circles touch one another externally then the straightline joining their centers will go through the point of union E F B D C A G For let two circles ABC and ADE touch one an other externally at point A and let the center F of ABC have been found Prop 31 and the center G of ADE Prop 31 I say that the straightline joining F to G will go through the point of union at A For if not then if possible let it go like FCDG in the gure and let AF and AG have been joined Therefore since point F is the center of circle ABC FA is equal to FC Again since point G is the center of circle ADE GA is equal to GD And FA was also shown 82STOIQEIWN g ELEMENTS BOOK 3 to be equal to FC Thus the straightlines FA and AG are equal to the straightlines FC and GD So the whole of FG is greater than FA and AG But it is also less Prop 120 The very thing is impossible Thus the straightline joining F to G cannot not go through the point of union at A Thus it will go through it Thus if two circles touch one another externally then the straightline joining their centers will go through the point of union Which is the very thing it was re quired to show ig Proposition 13 A circle does not touch another circle at more than one point whether they touch internally or externally D G H F E A C B K For if possible let circle ABDC touch circle EBFD rst of all internallyat more than one point D and B And let the center G of circle ABDC have been found Prop 31 and the center H of EBFD Prop 31 Thus the straightline joining G and H will fall on B and D Prop 311 Let it fall like BGHD in the gure And since point G is the center of circle ABDC BG is equal to GD Thus BG is greater than HD Thus BH is much greater than HD Again since point H is the center of circle EBFD BH is equal to HD But it was also shown to be much greater than it The very thing is impossible Thus a circle does not touch another circle internally at more than one point So I say that neither does it touch externally at more than one point For if possible let circle ACK touch circle ABDC externally at more than one point A and C And let AC have been joined Therefore since two points A and C have been taken at random on the circumference of each of the circles ABDC and ACK the straightline joining the points will fall inside each circle Prop 32 But it fell inside ABDC and outside ACK Def 33 The very thing 83STOIQEIWN g ELEMENTS BOOK 3 is absurd Thus a circle does not touch another circle externally at more than one point And it was shown that neither does it internally Thus a circle does not touch another circle at more than one point whether they touch internally or exter nally Which is the very thing it was required to show The Greek text has ABCD which is obviously a mistake id Proposition 14 In a circle equal straightlines are equally far from the center and straightlines which are equally far from the center are equal to one another F B D G E A C Let ABDC be a circle and let AB and CD be equal straightlines within it I say that AB and CD are equally far from the center For let the center of circle ABDC have been found Prop 31 and let it be at E And let EF and EG have been drawn from point E perpendicular to AB and CD respectively Prop 112 And let AE and EC have been joined Therefore since some straightline EF through the center of the circle cuts some other straightline AB not through the center at rightangles it also cuts it in half Prop 33 Thus AF is equal to FB Thus AB is double AF So for the same reasons CD is also double CG And AB is equal to CD Thus AF is also equal to CG And since AE is equal to EC the square on AE is also equal to the square on EC But the sum of the squares on AF and EF is equal to the square on AE For the angle at F is a right angle Prop 147 And the sum of the squares on EG and GC is equal to the square on EC For the angle at G is a rightangle Prop 147 Thus the sum of the squares on AF and FE is equal to the sum of the squares on CG and GE of which the square on AF is equal to the square on CG For AF is equal to CG 84STOIQEIWN g ELEMENTS BOOK 3 Thus the remaining square on FE is equal to the re maining square on EG Thus EF is equal to EG And straightlines in a circle are said to be equally far from the center when perpendicular straightlines which are drawn to them from the center are equal Def 34 Thus AB and CD are equally far from the center So let the straightlines AB and CD be equally far from the center That is to say let EF be equal to EG I say that AB is also equal to CD For with the same construction we can similarly show that AB is double AF and CD double CG And since AE is equal to CE the square on AE is equal to the square on CE But the sum of the squares on EF and FA is equal to the square on AE Prop 147 And the sum of the squares on EG and GC is equal to the square on CE Prop 147 Thus the sum of the squares on EF and FA is equal to the sum of the squares on EG and GC of which the square on EF is equal to the square on EG For EF is equal to EG Thus the remaining square on AF is equal to the re maining square on CG Thus AF is equal to CG And AB is double AF and CD double CG Thus AB is equal to CD Thus in a circle equal straightlines are equally far from the center and straightlines which are equally far from the center are equal to one another Which is the very thing it was required to show The Greek text has ABCD which is obviously a mistake ie Proposition 15 In a circle a diameter is the greatest straightline and for the others a straightline nearer to the center is always greater than one further away Let ABCD be a circle and let AD be its diameter and E its center And let BC be nearer to the diameter AD and FG further away I say that AD is the greatest straightline and BC is greater than FG For let EH and EK have been drawn from the cen ter E at rightangles to BC and FG respectively Prop 112 And since BC is nearer to the center and FG further away EK is thus greater than EH Def 35 Let EL be made equal to EH Prop 13 And LM being drawn through L at rightangles to EK Prop 111 let it have been drawn through to N And let ME EN FE and EG have been joined And since EH is equal to EL BC is also equal to MN Prop 314 Again since AE is equal to EM and ED to EN AD is thus equal to ME and EN But ME and EN is greater than MN Prop 120 also AD is 85STOIQEIWN g ELEMENTS BOOK 3 greater than MN and MN is equal to BC Thus AD is greater than BC And since the two straightlines ME EN are equal to the two straightlines FE EG respectively and angle MEN is greater than angle FEG the base MN is thus greater than the base FG Prop 124 But MN was shown to be equal to BC so BC is also greater than FG Thus the diameter AD is the greatest straightline and BC is greater than FG M G N D C H A F L E B K Thus in a circle a diameter is the greatest straight line and for the others a straightline nearer to the center is always greater than one further away Which is the very thing it was required to show Euclid should have said to the center rather than to the diameter AD since BC AD and F G are not necessarily parallel This is not proved except by reference to the gure i Proposition 16 A straightline drawn at rightangles to the diameter of a circle from its end will fall outside the circle And another straightline cannot be inserted into the space be tween the aforementioned straightline and the circum ference And the angle of the semicircle is greater than any acute rectilinear angle whatsoever and the remain ing angle is less than any acute rectilinear angle Let ABC be a circle around the center D and the di ameter AB I say that the straightline drawn from A at rightangles to AB Prop 111 from its end will fall outside the circle For if not then if possible let it fall inside like CA in the gure and let DC have been joined Since DA is equal to DC angle DAC is also equal to angle ACD Prop 15 And DAC is a rightangle Thus ACD is also a rightangle So in triangle ACD the two angles DAC and ACD are equal to two right angles The very thing is impossible Prop 117 Thus the straightline drawn from point A at rightangles 86STOIQEIWN g ELEMENTS BOOK 3 to BA will not fall inside the circle So similarly we can show that neither will it fall on the circumference Thus it will fall outside the circle H F E G D B A C Let it fall like AE in the gure So I say that another straightline cannot be inserted into the space between the straightline AE and the circumference CHA For if possible let it be inserted like FA in the g ure and let DG have been drawn from point D perpen dicular to FA Prop 112 And since AGD is a right angle and DAG is less than a rightangle AD is thus greater than DG Prop 119 And DA is equal to DH Thus DH is greater than DG the lesser than the greater The very thing is impossible Thus another straightline cannot be inserted into the space between the straightline AE and the circumference And I also say that the semicircular angle contained by the straightline BA and the circumference CHA is greater than any acute rectilinear angle whatsoever and the remaining angle contained by the circumference CHA and the straightline AE is less than any acute rec tilinear angle whatsoever For if any rectilinear angle is greater than the an gle contained by the straightline BA and the circum ference CHA or less than the angle contained by the circumference CHA and the straightline AE then a straightline can be inserted into the space between the circumference CHA and the straightline AEanything which will make an angle contained by straightlines greater than the angle contained by the straightline BA and the circumference CHA or less than the angle contained by the circumference CHA and the straight line AE But such a straightline cannot be inserted Thus an acute angle contained by straightlines cannot be greater than the angle contained by the straightline BA and the circumference CHA neither can it be less than the angle contained by the circumference CHA and the straightline AE 87STOIQEIWN g ELEMENTS BOOK 3 Pri sma Corollary So from this it is manifest that a straightline drawn at rightangles to the diameter of a circle from its extremity touches the circle and that the straightline touches the circle at a single point inasmuch as it was also shown that a straightline meeting the circle at two points falls inside it Prop 32 Which is the very thing it was required to show iz Proposition 17 To draw a straightline touching a given circle from a given point D A C G E B F Let A be the given point and BCD the given circle So it is required to draw a straightline touching circle BCD from point A For let the center E of the circle have been found Prop 31 and let AE have been joined And let the circle AFG have been drawn with center E and radius EA And let DF have been drawn from from point D at rightangles to EA Prop 111 And let EF and AB have been joined I say that the straightline AB has been drawn from point A touching circle BCD For since E is the center of circles BCD and AFG EA is thus equal to EF and ED to EB So the two straightlines AE EB are equal to the two straight lines FE ED respectively And they contain a com mon angle at E Thus the base DF is equal to the base AB and triangle DEF is equal to triangle EBA and the remaining angles are equal to the corre sponding remaining angles Prop 14 Thus angle EDF is equal to EBA And EDF is a rightangle Thus EBA is also a rightangle And EB is a ra dius And a straightline drawn at rightangles to the diameter of a circle from its extremity touches the circle Prop 316 corr Thus AB touches circle BCD Thus the straightline AB has been drawn touching 88STOIQEIWN g ELEMENTS BOOK 3 the given circle BCD from the given point A Which is the very thing it was required to do ih Proposition 18 If some straightline touches a circle and some other straightline is joined from the center of the cir cle to the point of contact then the straightline so joined will be perpendicular to the tangent D A G C E F B For let some straightline DE touch the circle ABC at point C and let the center F of circle ABC have been found Prop 31 and let FC have been joined from F to C I say that FC is perpendicular to DE For if not let FG have been drawn from F perpen dicular to DE Prop 112 Therefore since angle FGC is a rightangle angle FCG is thus acute Prop 117 And the greater angle is subtended by the greater side Prop 119 Thus FC is greater than FG And FC is equal to FB Thus FB is also greater than FG the lesser than the greater The very thing is impossible Thus FG is not perpendicular to DE So similarly we can show that neither is any other straightline except FC Thus FC is perpendicular to DE Thus if some straightline touches a circle and some other straightline is joined from the center of the cir cle to the point of contact then the straightline so joined will be perpendicular to the tangent Which is the very thing it was required to show ij Proposition 19 If some straightline touches a circle and a straight line is drawn from the point of contact at rightangles to the tangent then the center of the circle will be on the straightline so drawn For let some straightline DE touch the circle ABC at point C And let CA have been drawn from C at right 89STOIQEIWN g ELEMENTS BOOK 3 angles to DE Prop 111 I say that the center of the circle is on AC B D E C F A For if not if possible let F be the center of the circle and let CF have been joined Therefore since some straightline DE touches the circle ABC and FC has been joined from the center to the point of contact FC is thus perpendicular to DE Prop 318 Thus FCE is a rightangle And ACE is also a rightangle Thus FCE is equal to ACE the lesser to the greater The very thing is impossible Thus F is not the center of circle ABC So similarly we can show that neither is any point other than one on AC Thus if some straightline touches a circle and a straight line is drawn from the point of contact at rightangles to the tangent then the center of the circle will be on the straightline so drawn Which is the very thing it was required to show k Proposition 20 In a circle the angle at the center is double that at the circumference when the angles have the same circumfer ence base Let ABC be a circle and let BEC be an angle at its center and BAC one at its circumference And let them have the same circumference base BC I say that angle BEC is double angle BAC For being joined let AE have been drawn through to F Therefore since EA is equal to EB angle EAB is also equal to EBA Prop 15 Thus angle EAB and EBA is double angle EAB And BEF is equal to EAB and EBA Prop 132 Thus BEF is also double EAB So for the same reasons FEC is also double EAC Thus the whole angle BEC is double the whole angle BAC 90STOIQEIWN g ELEMENTS BOOK 3 E A C B F G D So let another straightline have been inected and let there be another angle BDC And DE being joined let it have been produced to G So similarly we can show that angle GEC is double EDC of which GEB is double EDB Thus the remaining angle BEC is double the remaining angle BDC Thus in a circle the angle at the center is double that at the circumference when the angles have the same circumference base Which is the very thing it was re quired to show ka Proposition 21 In a circle angles in the same segment are equal to one another D A B F E C Let ABCD be a circle and let BAD and BED be angles in the same segment BAED I say that angles BAD and BED are equal to one another For let the center of circle ABCD have been found Prop 31 and let it be at point F And let BF and FD have been joined And since angle BFD is at the center and BAD at the circumference and they have the same circumference base BCD angle BFD is thus double BAD Prop 320 91STOIQEIWN g ELEMENTS BOOK 3 So for the same reasons BFD is also double BED Thus BAD is equal to BED Thus in a circle angles in the same segment are equal to one another Which is the very thing it was required to show kb Proposition 22 For quadrilaterals within circles the sum of the op posite angles is equal to two rightangles D A B C Let ABCD be a circle and let ABCD be a quadrilat eral within it I say that the sum of the opposite angles is equal to two rightangles Let AC and BD have been joined Therefore since the three angles of any triangle are equal to two rightangles Prop 132 the three angles CAB ABC and BCA of triangle ABC are thus equal to two rightangles And CAB is equal to BDC For they are in the same segment BADC Prop 321 And ACB is equal to ADB For they are in the same seg ment ADCB Prop 321 Thus the whole of ADC is equal to BAC and ACB Let ABC have been added to both Thus ABC BAC and ACB are equal to ABC and ADC But ABC BAC and ACB are equal to two rightangles Thus ABC and ADC are also equal to two rightangles Similarly we can show that angles BAD and DCB are also equal to two rightangles Thus for quadrilaterals within circles the sum of the opposite angles is equal to two rightangles Which is the very thing it was required to show kg Proposition 23 Two similar and unequal segments of circles cannot be constructed on the same side of the same straightline For if possible let the two similar and unequal seg ments of circles ACB and ADB have been constructed on the same side of the same straightline AB And let 92STOIQEIWN g ELEMENTS BOOK 3 ACD have been drawn through the segments and let CB and DB have been joined C A B D Therefore since segment ACB is similar to segment ADB and similar segments of circles are those accept ing equal angles Def 311 angle ACB is thus equal to ADB the external to the internal The very thing is impossible Prop 116 Thus two similar and unequal segments of circles cannot be constructed on the same side of the same straightline kd Proposition 24 Similar segments of circles on equal straightlines are equal to one another F A B E C D G For let AEB and CFD be similar segments of circles on the equal straightlines AB and CD respectively I say that segment AEB is equal to segment CFD For if the segment AEB is applied to the segment CFD and point A is placed on point C and the straightline AB on CD then point B will also coincide with point D on account of AB being equal to CD And if AB coincides with CD then the segment AEB will also coincide with CFD For if the straightline AB coincides with CD and the segment AEB does not coincide with CFD then it will surely either fall inside it outside it or it will miss like CGD in the gure and a circle will cut another circle at more than two points The very 93STOIQEIWN g ELEMENTS BOOK 3 thing is impossible Prop 310 Thus if the straightline AB is applied to CD the segment AEB cannot not also coincide with CFD Thus it will coincide and will be equal to it CN 4 Thus similar segments of circles on equal straight lines are equal to one another Which is the very thing it was required to show Both this possibility and the previous one are precluded by Prop 323 ke Proposition 25 For a given segment of a circle to complete the circle the very one of which it is a segment C C D A A D C E B B B A D E Let ABC be the given segment of a circle So it is re quired to complete the circle for segment ABC the very one of which it is a segment For let AC have been cut in half at point D Prop 110 and let DB have been drawn from point D at rightangles to AC Prop 111 And let AB have been joined Thus angle ABD is surely either greater than equal to or less than angle BAD First of all let it be greater And let angle BAE equal to angle ABD have been constructed on the straightline BA at the point A on it Prop 123 And let DB have been drawn through to E and let EC have been joined Therefore since angle ABE is equal to BAE the straightline EB is thus also equal to EA Prop 16 And since AD is equal to DC and DE is common the two straightlines AD DE are equal to the two straightlines CD DE respectively And angle ADE is equal to angle CDE For each is a rightangle Thus the base AE is equal to the base CE Prop 14 But AE was shown to be equal to BE Thus BE is also equal to CE Thus the three straightlines AE EB and EC are equal to one another Thus if a cir cle is drawn with center E and radius one of AE EB or EC it will also go through the remaining points of the segment and the associated circle will have been completed Prop 39 Thus a circle has been completed from the given segment of a circle And it is clear that the segment ABC is less than a semicircle because the center E happens to lie outside it 94STOIQEIWN g ELEMENTS BOOK 3 And similarly even if angle ABD is equal to BAD since AD becomes equal to each of BD Prop 16 and DC the three straightlines DA DB and DC will be equal to one another And point D will be the center of the completed circle And ABC will manifestly be a semicircle And if ABD is less than BAD and we construct an gle BAE equal to angle ABD on the straightline BA at the point A on it Prop 123 then the center will fall on DB inside the segment ABC And segment ABC will manifestly be greater than a semicircle Thus a circle has been completed from the given seg ment of a circle Which is the very thing it was required to do k Proposition 26 In equal circles equal angles stand upon equal cir cumferences whether they are standing at the center or at the circumference A G C K H D F L B E Let ABC and DEF be equal circles and within them let BGC and EHF be equal angles at the center and BAC and EDF equal angles at the circumference I say that circumference BKC is equal to circumference ELF For let BC and EF have been joined And since circles ABC and DEF are equal their radii are equal So the two straightlines BG GC are equal to the two straightlines EH HF respectively And the angle at G is equal to the angle at H Thus the base BC is equal to the base EF Prop 14 And since the angle at A is equal to the angle at D the segment BAC is thus similar to the segment EDF Def 311 And they are on equal straightlines BC and EF And simi lar segments of circles on equal straightlines are equal to one another Prop 324 Thus segment BAC is equal to segment EDF And the whole circle ABC is also equal to the whole circle DEF Thus the remaining circum ference BKC is equal to the remaining circumference ELF Thus in equal circles equal angles stand upon equal circumferences whether they are standing at the center 95STOIQEIWN g ELEMENTS BOOK 3 or at the circumference Which is the very thing which it was required to show kz Proposition 27 In equal circles angles standing upon equal circum ferences are equal to one another whether they are standing at the center or at the circumference A G C K D H F B E For let the angles BGC and EHF at the centers G and H and the angles BAC and EDF at the circum ferences stand upon the equal circumferences BC and EF in the equal circles ABC and DEF respectively I say that angle BGC is equal to angle EHF and BAC is equal to EDF For if BGC is unequal to EHF one of them is greater Let BGC be greater and let the angle BGK equal to angle EHF have been constructed on the straightline BG at the point G on it Prop 123 But equal angles in equal circles stand upon equal circumferences when they are at the centers Prop 326 Thus circumference BK is equal to circumference EF But EF is equal to BC Thus BK is also equal to BC the lesser to the greater The very thing is impossible Thus angle BGC is not unequal to EHF Thus it is equal And the angle at A is half BGC and the angle at D half EHF Prop 320 Thus the angle at A is also equal to the angle at D Thus in equal circles angles standing upon equal cir cumferences are equal to one another whether they are standing at the center or at the circumference Which is the very thing it was required to show kh Proposition 28 In equal circles equal straightlines cut off equal cir cumferences the greater circumference being equal to the greater and the lesser to the lesser Let ABC and DEF be equal circles and let AB and DE be equal straightlines in these circles cutting off the greater circumferences ACB and DFE and the lesser circumferences AGB and DHE respectively I say that the greater circumference ACB is equal to the greater circumference DFE and the lesser circumfer 96STOIQEIWN g ELEMENTS BOOK 3 ence AGB to the lesser DHE F A K C B G D L H E For let the centers of the circles K and L have been found Prop 31 and let AK KB DL and LE have been joined And since ABC and DEF are equal circles their radii are also equal Def 31 So the two straight lines AK KB are equal to the two straightlines DL LE respectively And the base AB is equal to the base DE Thus angle AKB is equal to angle DLE Prop 18 And equal angles stand upon equal circum ferences when they are at the centers Prop 326 Thus circumference AGB is equal to DHE And the whole circle ABC is also equal to the whole circle DEF Thus the remaining circumference ACB is also equal to the remaining circumference DFE Thus in equal circles equal straightlines cut off equal circumferences the greater circumference being equal to the greater and the lesser to the lesser Which is the very thing it was required to show kj Proposition 29 In equal circles equal straightlines subtend equal cir cumferences E A K B G D L H C F Let ABC and DEF be equal circles and within them let the equal circumferences BGC and EHF have been cut off And let the straightlines BC and EF have been joined I say that BC is equal to EF For let the centers of the circles have been found Prop 31 and let them be at K and L And let BK 97STOIQEIWN g ELEMENTS BOOK 3 KC EL and LF have been joined And since the circumference BGC is equal to the cir cumference EHF the angle BKC is also equal to an gle ELF Prop 327 And since the circles ABC and DEF are equal their radii are also equal Def 31 So the two straightlines BK KC are equal to the two straightlines EL LF respectively And they contain equal angles Thus the base BC is equal to the base EF Prop 14 Thus in equal circles equal straightlines subtend equal circumferences Which is the very thing it was required to show l Proposition 30 To cut a given circumference in half D A B C Let ADB be the given circumference So it is required to cut circumference ADB in half Let AB have been joined and let it have been cut in half at point C Prop 110 And let CD have been drawn from point C at rightangles to AB Prop 111 And let AD and DB have been joined And since AC is equal to CB and CD is com mon the two straightlines AC CD are equal to the two straightlines BC CD respectively And angle ACD is equal to angle BCD For they are each right angles Thus the base AD is equal to the base DB Prop 14 And equal straightlines cut off equal circum ferences the greater circumference being equal to the greater and the lesser to the lesser Prop 128 And the circumferences AD and DB are each less than a semi circle Thus circumference AD is equal to circumfer ence DB Thus the given circumference has been cut in half at point D Which is the very thing it was required to do la Proposition 31 In a circle the angle in a semicircle is a rightangle and that in a greater segment is less than a rightangle and that in a lesser segment is greater than a right angle And further the angle of a segment greater than a semicircle is greater than a rightangle and the an 98STOIQEIWN g ELEMENTS BOOK 3 gle of a segment less than a semicircle is less than a rightangle A D B E C F Let ABCD be a circle and let BC be its diameter and E its center And let BA AC AD and DC have been joined I say that the angle BAC in the semicircle BAC is a rightangle and the angle ABC in the segment ABC which is greater than a semicircle is less than a right angle and the angle ADC in the segment ADC which is less than a semicircle is greater than a rightangle Let AE have been joined and let BA have been drawn through to F And since BE is equal to EA angle ABE is also equal to BAE Prop 15 Again since CE is equal to EA ACE is also equal to CAE Prop 15 Thus the whole angle BAC is equal to the two angles ABC and ACB And FAC which is external to triangle ABC is also equal to the two angles ABC and ACB Prop 132 Thus angle BAC is also equal to FAC Thus they are each rightangles Def 110 Thus the angle BAC in the semicircle BAC is a rightangle And since the two angles ABC and BAC of trian gle ABC are less than two rightangles Prop 117 and BAC is a rightangle angle ABC is thus less than a right angle And it is in segment ABC which is greater than a semicircle And since ABCD is a quadrilateral within a circle and for quadrilaterals within circles the sum of the op posite angles is equal to two rightangles Prop 322 angles ABC and ADC are thus equal to two right angles and angle ABC is less than a rightangle The remaining angle ADC is thus greater than a rightangle And it is in segment ADC which is less than a semi circle I also say that the angle of the greater segment namely that contained by the circumference ABC and the straightline AC is greater than a rightangle And the angle of the lesser segment namely that contained 99STOIQEIWN g ELEMENTS BOOK 3 by the circumference ADC and the straightline AC is less than a rightangle And this is immediately apparent For since the angle contained by the two straightlines BA and AC is a rightangle the angle contained by the circumference ABC and the straightline AC is thus greater than a rightangle Again since the angle con tained by the straightlines AC and AF is a rightangle the angle contained by the circumference ADC and the straightline CA is thus less than a rightangle Thus in a circle the angle in a semicircle is a right angle and that in a greater segment is less than a rightangle and that in a lesser segment is greater than a rightangle And further the angle of a seg ment greater than a semicircle is greater than a right angle and the angle of a segment less than a semi circle is less than a rightangle Which is the very thing it was required to show lb Proposition 32 If some straightline touches a circle and some other straightline is drawn across from the point of contact into the circle cutting the circle in two then those angles the straightline makes with the tangent will be equal to the angles in the alternate segments of the circle A E B F D C A E B F D C For let some straightline EF touch the circle ABCD at the point B and let some other straightline BD have been drawn from point B into the circle ABCD cutting it in two I say that the angles BD makes with the tangent EF will be equal to the angles in the alter nate segments of the circle That is to say that angle FBD is equal to the angle constructed in segment BAD and angle EBD is equal to the angle constructed in seg ment DCB For let BA have been drawn from B at rightangles to EF Prop 111 And let the point C have been taken at random on the circumference BD And let AD DC 100STOIQEIWN g ELEMENTS BOOK 3 and CB have been joined And since some straightline EF touches the circle ABCD at point B and BA has been drawn from the point of contact at rightangles to the tangent the center of circle ABCD is thus on BA Prop 319 Thus BA is a diameter of circle ABCD Thus angle ADB being in a semicircle is a rightangle Prop 331 Thus the remaining angles of triangle ADB BAD and ABD are equal to one rightangle Prop 132 And ABF is also a rightangle Thus ABF is equal to BAD and ABD Let ABD have been subtracted from both Thus the remain ing angle DBF is equal to the angle BAD in the alternate segment of the circle And since ABCD is a quadrilateral in a circle the sum of its opposite angles is equal to two rightangles Prop 322 And DBF and DBE is also equal to two rightangles Prop 113 Thus DBF and DBE is equal to BAD and BCD of which BAD was shown to be equal to DBF Thus the remaining angle DBE is equal to the angle DCB in the alternate segment DCB of the circle Thus if some straightline touches a circle and some other straightline is drawn across from the point of contact into the circle cutting the circle in two then those angles the straightline makes with the tangent will be equal to the angles in the alternate segments of the circle Which is the very thing it was required to show lg Proposition 33 To draw a segment of a circle accepting an angle equal to a given rectilinear angle on a given straightline H A C A G F B E F A D G D C C F E E B B D Let AB be the given straightline and C the given rectilinear angle So it is required to draw a segment of a circle accepting an angle equal to C on the given straightline AB So the angle C is surely either acute a rightangle or obtuse First of all let it be acute And as in the rst diagram from the left let angle BAD equal to angle C have been constructed on the straightline AB at the point A on it Prop 123 Thus BAD is also acute Let AE have been drawn at rightangles to DA Prop 111 101STOIQEIWN g ELEMENTS BOOK 3 And let AB have been cut in half at F Prop 110 And let FG have been drawn from point F at rightangles to AB Prop 111 And let GB have been joined And since AF is equal to FB and FG is common the two straightlines AF FG are equal to the two straightlines BF FG respectively And angle AFG is equal to angle BFG Thus the base AG is equal to the base BG Prop 14 Thus the circle drawn with center G and radius GA will also go through B as well as A Let it have been drawn and let it be de noted ABE And let EB have been joined Therefore since AD is at the extremity of diameter AE namely point A at rightangles to AE the straightline AD thus touches the circle ABE Prop 316 corr There fore since some straightline AD touches the circle ABE and some other straightline AB has been drawn across from the point of contact A into circle ABE angle DAB is thus equal to the angle AEB in the alternate segment of the circle Prop 332 But DAB is equal to C Thus angle C is also equal to AEB Thus a segment AEB of a circle accepting the angle AEB which is equal to the given angle C has been drawn on the given straightline AB And so let C be a rightangle And let it again be necessary to draw a segment of a circle on AB accepting an angle equal to the rightangle C Let the angle BAD again have been constructed equal to the right angle C Prop 123 as in the second diagram from the left And let AB have been cut in half at F Prop 110 And let the circle AEB have been drawn with center F and radius either FA or FB Thus the straightline AD touches the circle ABE on account of the angle at A being a rightangle Prop 316 corr And angle BAD is equal to the angle in segment AEB For the latter angle being in a semicircle is also a rightangle Prop 331 But BAD is also equal to C Thus the angle in segment AEB is also equal to C Thus a segment AEB of a circle accepting an angle equal to C has again been drawn on AB And so let angle C be obtuse And let angle BAD equal to C have been constructed on the straightline AB at the point A on it Prop 123 as in the third diagram from the left And let AE have been drawn at rightangles to AD Prop 111 And let AB have again been cut in half at F Prop 110 And let FG have been drawn at rightangles to AB Prop 110 And let GB have been joined And again since AF is equal to FB and FG is common the two straightlines AF FG are equal to the two straightlines BF FG respectively And an gle AFG is equal to angle BFG Thus the base AG is 102STOIQEIWN g ELEMENTS BOOK 3 equal to the base BG Prop 14 Thus a circle of center G and radius GA being drawn will also go through B as well as A Let it go like AEB in the third diagram from the left And since AD is at rightangles to the di ameter AE at its extremity AD thus touches circle AEB Prop 316 corr And AB has been drawn across the circle from the point of contact A Thus angle BAD is equal to the angle constructed in the alternate segment AHB of the circle Prop 332 But angle BAD is equal to C Thus the angle in segment AHB is also equal to C Thus a segment AHB of a circle accepting an angle equal to C has been drawn on the given straightline AB Which is the very thing it was required to do ld Proposition 34 To cut off a segment accepting an angle equal to a given rectilinear angle from a given circle D A E B F C Let ABC be the given circle and D the given rectilin ear angle So it is required to cut off a segment accepting an angle equal to the given rectilinear angle D from the given circle ABC Let EF have been drawn touching ABC at point B And let angle FBC equal to angle D have been con structed on the straightline FB at the point B on it Prop 123 Therefore since some straightline EF touches the circle ABC and BC has been drawn across the circle from the point of contact B angle FBC is thus equal to the angle constructed in the alternate segment BAC Prop 132 But FBC is equal to D Thus the angle in the segment BAC is also equal to angle D Thus the segment BAC accepting an angle equal to the given rectilinear angle D has been cut off from the given circle ABC Which is the very thing it was re quired to do Presumably by nding the center of ABC Prop 31 drawing a straightline between the center and point B and then drawing EF through 103STOIQEIWN g ELEMENTS BOOK 3 point B at rightangles to the aforementioned straightline Prop 111 le Proposition 35 If two straightlines in a circle cut one another then the rectangle contained by the pieces of one is equal to the rectangle contained by the pieces of the other A E G B C E B D D C F H A For let the two straightlines AC and BD in the circle ABCD cut one another at point E I say that the rect angle contained by AE and EC is equal to the rectangle contained by DE and EB In fact if AC and BD are through the center as in the rst diagram from the left so that E is the center of circle ABCD then it is clear that AE EC DE and EB being equal the rectangle contained by AE and EC is also equal to the rectangle contained by DE and EB So let AC and DB not be though the center as in the second diagram from the left and let the center of ABCD have been found Prop 31 and let it be at F And let FG and FH have been drawn from F perpen dicular to the straightlines AC and DB respectively Prop 112 And let FB FC and FE have been joined And since some straightline GF through the center cuts at rightangles some other straightline AC not through the center then it also cuts it in half Prop 33 Thus AG is equal to GC Therefore since the straight line AC is cut equally at G and unequally at E the rectangle contained by AE and EC plus the square on EG is thus equal to the square on GC Prop 25 Let the square on GF have been added to both Thus the rectangle contained by AE and EC plus the sum of the squares on GE and GF is equal to the sum of the squares on CG and GF But the square on FE is equal to the sum of the squares on EG and GF Prop 147 and the square on FC is equal to the sum of the squares on CG and GF Prop 147 Thus the rectangle contained by AE and EC plus the square on FE is equal to the square on FC And FC is equal to FB Thus the rectangle contained by AE and EC plus the square on FE is equal to the square on FB So for the same reasons the rectangle con tained by DE and EB plus the square on FE is equal 104STOIQEIWN g ELEMENTS BOOK 3 to the square on FB And the rectangle contained by AE and EC plus the square on FE was also shown to be equal to the square on FB Thus the rect angle contained by AE and EC plus the square on FE is equal to the rectangle contained by DE and EB plus the square on FE Let the square on FE have been taken from both Thus the remaining rectangle con tained by AE and EC is equal to the rectangle contained by DE and EB Thus if two straightlines in a circle cut one another then the rectangle contained by the pieces of one is equal to the rectangle contained by the pieces of the other Which is the very thing it was required to show l Proposition 36 If some point is taken outside a circle and two straightlines radiate from it towards the circle and one of them cuts the circle and the other touches it then the rectangle contained by the whole straightline cutting the circle and the part of it cut off outside the circle between the point and the convex circumfer ence will be equal to the square on the tangent line E D B F A F A B C D C For let some point D have been taken outside circle ABC and let two straightlines DCA and DB radi ate from D towards circle ABC And let DCA cut circle ABC and let BD touch it I say that the rectangle contained by AD and DC is equal to the square on DB DCA is surely either through the center or not Let it rst of all be through the center and let F be the cen ter of circle ABC and let FB have been joined Thus angle FBD is a rightangle Prop 318 And since straightline AC is cut in half at F let CD have been added to it Thus the rectangle contained by AD and DC plus the square on FC is equal to the square on FD Prop 26 And FC is equal to FB Thus the rectangle contained by AD and DC plus the square on FB is equal to the square on FD And the square on FD is equal to the sum of the squares on FB and BD Prop 147 Thus the rectangle contained by AD 105STOIQEIWN g ELEMENTS BOOK 3 and DC plus the square on FB is equal to the sum of the squares on FB and BD Let the square on FB have been subtracted from both Thus the remain ing rectangle contained by AD and DC is equal to the square on the tangent DB And so let DCA not be through the center of cir cle ABC and let the center E have been found and let EF have been drawn from E perpendicular to AC Prop 112 And let EB EC and ED have been joined Angle EBD is thus a rightangle Prop 318 And since some straightline EF through the center cuts some other straightline AC not through the center at rightangles it also cuts it in half Prop 33 Thus AF is equal to FC And since the straightline AC is cut in half at point F let CD have been added to it Thus the rectangle contained by AD and DC plus the square on FC is equal to the square on FD Prop 26 Let the square on FE have been added to both Thus the rectangle contained by AD and DC plus the sum of the squares on CF and FE is equal to the sum of the squares on FD and FE But the square on EC is equal to the sum of the squares on CF and FE For angle EFC is a rightangle Prop 147 And the square on ED is equal to the sum of the squares on DF and FE Prop 147 Thus the rectangle contained by AD and DC plus the square on EC is equal to the square on ED And EC is equal to EB Thus the rectan gle contained by AD and DC plus the square on EB is equal to the square on ED And the sum of the squares on EB and BD is equal to the square on ED For EBD is a rightangle Prop 147 Thus the rect angle contained by AD and DC plus the square on EB is equal to the sum of the squares on EB and BD Let the square on EB have been subtracted from both Thus the remaining rectangle contained by AD and DC is equal to the square on BD Thus if some point is taken outside a circle and two straightlines radiate from it towards the circle and one of them cuts the circle and the other touches it then the rectangle contained by the whole straightline cutting the circle and the part of it cut off outside the circle between the point and the convex circumfer ence will be equal to the square on the tangent line Which is the very thing it was required to show lz Proposition 37 If some point is taken outside a circle and two straightlines radiate from the point towards the circle and one of them cuts the circle and the other meets it and the rectangle contained by the whole straight 106STOIQEIWN g ELEMENTS BOOK 3 line cutting the circle and the part of it cut off out side the circle between the point and the convex cir cumference is equal to the square on the straightline meeting the circle then the straightline meeting the circle will touch the circle E F A B D C For let some point D have been taken outside circle ABC and let two straightlines DCA and DB radiate from D towards circle ABC and let DCA cut the circle and let DB meet the circle And let the rectangle con tained by AD and DC be equal to the square on DB I say that DB touches circle ABC For let DE have been drawn touching ABC Prop 317 and let the center of the circle ABC have been found and let it be at F And let FE FB and FD have been joined Angle FED is thus a rightangle Prop 318 And since DE touches circle ABC and DCA cuts it the rectangle contained by AD and DC is thus equal to the square on DE Prop 336 And the rectangle contained by AD and DC was also equal to the square on DB Thus the square on DE is equal to the square on DB Thus DE is equal to DB And FE is also equal to FB So the two straightlines DE EF are equal to the two straightlines DB BF re spectively And their base FD is common Thus angle DEF is equal to angle DBF Prop 18 And DEF is a rightangle Thus DBF is also a rightangle And FB produced is a diameter And a straightline drawn at rightangles to a diameter of a circle at its extremity touches the circle Prop 316 corr Thus DB touches circle ABC Similarly the same thing can be shown even if the center happens to be on AC Thus if some point is taken outside a circle and two straightlines radiate from the point towards the circle and one of them cuts the circle and the other meets it and the rectangle contained by the whole straight line cutting the circle and the part of it cut off out side the circle between the point and the convex cir cumference is equal to the square on the straightline meeting the circle then the straightline meeting the circle will touch the circle Which is the very thing it 107STOIQEIWN g ELEMENTS BOOK 3 was required to show 108ELEMENTS BOOK 4 Construction of Rectilinear Figures In and Around Circles 109STOIQEIWN d ELEMENTS BOOK 4 V Oroi Denitions 1 A rectilinear gure is said to be inscribed in another rectilinear gure when the respective angles of the inscribed gure touch the respective sides of the gure in which it is inscribed 2 And similarly a rectilinear gure is said to be cir cumscribed about another rectilinear gure when the respective sides of the circumscribed gure touch the respective angles of the gure about which it is circum scribed 3 A rectilinear gure is said to be inscribed in a cir cle when each angle of the inscribed gure touches the circumference of the circle 4 And a rectilinear gure is said to be circumscribed about a circle when each side of the circumscribed g ure touches the circumference of the circle 5 And similarly a circle is said to be inscribed in a rectilinear gure when the circumference of the circle touches each side of the gure in which it is inscribed 6 And a circle is said to be circumscribed about a rectilinear gure when the circumference of the circle touches each angle of the gure about which it is cir cumscribed 7 A straightline is said to be inserted into a circle when its extemities are on the circumference of the circle a Proposition 1 To insert a straightline equal to a given straightline into a circle the latter straightline not being greater than the diameter of the circle F D B C E A Let ABC be the given circle and D the given straight line which is not greater than the diameter of the cir cle So it is required to insert a straightline equal to the straightline D into the circle ABC Let a diameter BC of circle ABC have been drawn 110STOIQEIWN d ELEMENTS BOOK 4 Therefore if BC is equal to D then that which was prescribed has taken place For the straightline BC equal to the straightline D has been inserted into the circle ABC And if BC is greater than D then let CE be made equal to D Prop 13 and let the circle EAF have been drawn with center C and radius CE And let CA have been joined Therefore since the point C is the center of circle EAF CA is equal to CE But CE is equal to D Thus D is also equal to CA Thus CA equal to the given straightline D has been inserted into the given circle ABC Which is the very thing it was required to do Presumably by nding the center of the circle Prop 31 and then drawing a line through it b Proposition 2 To inscribe a triangle equiangular with a given trian gle in a given circle D H C B E F A G Let ABC be the given circle and DEF the given tri angle So it is required to inscribe a triangle equiangular with triangle DEF in circle ABC Let GH have been drawn touching circle ABC at A And let angle HAC equal to angle DEF have been constructed on the straightline AH at the point A on it and angle GAB equal to angle DFE on the straight line AG at the point A on it Prop 123 And let BC have been joined Therefore since some straightline AH touches the circle ABC and the straightline AC has been drawn across the circle from the point of contact A angle HAC is thus equal to the angle ABC in the alternate segment of the circle Prop 332 But HAC is equal to DEF Thus angle ABC is also equal to DEF So for the same reasons ACB is also equal to DFE Thus the re maining angle BAC is equal to the remaining angle EDF Prop 132 Thus triangle ABC is equiangu lar with triangle DEF and has been inscribed in circle 111STOIQEIWN d ELEMENTS BOOK 4 ABC Thus a triangle equiangular with the given triangle has been inscribed in the given circle Which is the very thing it was required to do See the footnote to Prop 334 g Proposition 3 To circumscribe a triangle equiangular with a given triangle about a given circle A L C N G H D M E K B F Let ABC be the given circle and DEF the given tri angle So it is required to circumscribe a triangle equian gular with triangle DEF about circle ABC Let EF have been produced in each direction to points G and H And let the center K of circle ABC have been found Prop 31 And let the straightline KB have been drawn at random across ABC And let angle BKA equal to angle DEG have been con structed on the straightline KB at the point K on it and angle BKC equal to DFH Prop 123 And let the straightlines LAM MBN and NCL have been drawn through the points A B and C respectively touching the circle ABC And since LM MN and NL touch circle ABC at points A B and C respectively and KA KB and KC are joined from the center K to points A B and C respectively the angles at points A B and C are thus rightangles Prop 318 And since the sum of the four angles of quadrilateral AMBK is equal to four right angles inasmuch as AMBK can also be divided into two triangles Prop 132 and angles KAM and KBM are both rightangles the sum of the remaining an gles AKB and AMB is thus equal to two rightangles And DEG and DEF is also equal to two rightangles Prop 113 Thus AKB and AMB is equal to DEG and DEF of which AKB is equal to DEG Thus the re mainder AMB is equal to the remainder DEF So sim ilarly it can be shown that LNB is also equal to DFE Thus the remaining angle MLN is also equal to the 112STOIQEIWN d ELEMENTS BOOK 4 remaining angle EDF Prop 132 Thus triangle LMN is equiangular with triangle DEF And it has been drawn around circle ABC Thus a triangle equiangular with the given triangle has been circumscribed about the given circle Which is the very thing it was required to do See the footnote to Prop 334 d Proposition 4 To inscribe a circle in a given triangle G A E B F D C Let ABC be the given triangle So it is required to inscribe a circle in triangle ABC Let the angles ABC and ACB have been cut in half by the straightlines BD and CD respectively Prop 19 and let them meet one another at point D and let DE DF and DG have been drawn from point D perpendic ular to the straightlines AB BC and CA respectively Prop 112 And since angle ABD is equal to CBD and the right angle BED is also equal to the rightangle BFD EBD and FBD are thus two triangles having two angles equal to two angles and one side equal to one sidethe one subtending one of the equal angles which is common to the trianglesnamely BD Thus they will also have the remaining sides equal to the corresponding remain ing sides Prop 126 Thus DE is equal to DF So for the same reasons DG is also equal to DF Thus the three straightlines DE DF and DG are equal to one another Thus the circle drawn with center D and radius one of E F or G will also go through the re maining points and will touch the straightlines AB BC and CA on account of the angles at E F and G being rightangles For if it cuts one of them then it will be a straightline drawn at rightangles to a diameter of the circle from its extremity falling inside the circle The very thing was shown to be absurd Prop 316 Thus the circle drawn with center D and radius one of E F 113STOIQEIWN d ELEMENTS BOOK 4 or G does not cut the straightlines AB BC and CA Thus it will touch them and will be the circle inscribed in triangle ABC Let it have been so inscribed like FGE in the gure Thus the circle EFG has been inscribed in the given triangle ABC Which is the very thing it was required to do Here and in the following propositions it is understood that the radius is actually one of DE DF or DG e Proposition 5 To circumscribe a circle about a given triangle C D A E B F D A E C B A E C F B F D Let ABC be the given triangle So it is required to circumscribe a circle about the given triangle ABC Let the straightlines AB and AC have been cut in half at points D and E respectively Prop 110 And let DF and EF have been drawn from points D and E at rightangles to AB and AC respectively Prop 111 So DF and EF will surely either meet inside triangle ABC on the straightline BC or beyond BC Let them rst of all meet inside triangle ABC at point F and let FB FC and FA have been joined And since AD is equal to DB and DF is common and at rightangles the base AF is thus equal to the base FB Prop 14 So similarly we can show that CF is also equal to AF So that FB is also equal to FC Thus the three straightlines FA FB and FC are equal to one another Thus the circle drawn with center F and radius one of A B or C will also go through the remaining points And the circle will have been circumscribed about triangle ABC Let it have been so circumscribed like ABC in the rst diagram from the left And so let DF and EF meet on the straightline BC at point F like in the second diagram from the left And let AF have been joined So similarly we can show that point F is the center of the circle circumscribed about triangle ABC And so let DF and EF meet outside triangle ABC again at point F like in the third diagram from the left And let AF BF and CF have been joined And again since AD is equal to DB and DF is common and at rightangles the base AF is thus equal to the base BF Prop 14 So similarly we can show that CF is also equal to AF So that BF is also equal to FC Thus 114STOIQEIWN d ELEMENTS BOOK 4 again the circle drawn with center F and radius one of FA FB and FC will also go through the remaining points And it will have been circumscribed about trian gle ABC Thus a circle has been circumscribed about the given triangle Which is the very thing it was required to do Proposition 6 To inscribe a square in a given circle C B A E D Let ABCD be the given circle So it is required to inscribe a square in circle ABCD Let two diameters of circle ABCD AC and BD have been drawn at rightangles to one another And let AB BC CD and DA have been joined And since BE is equal to ED for E is the center of the circle and EA is common and at rightangles the base AB is thus equal to the base AD Prop 14 So for the same reasons each of BC and CD is equal to each of AB and AD Thus the quadrilateral ABCD is equilateral So I say that it is also rightangled For since the straightline BD is a diameter of circle ABCD BAD is thus a semicircle Thus angle BAD is a right angle Prop 331 So for the same reasons angles ABC BCD and CDA are also each rightangles Thus the quadrilateral ABCD is rightangled And it was also shown to be equilateral Thus it is a square Def 122 And it has been inscribed in circle ABCD Thus the square ABCD has been inscribed in the given circle Which is the very thing it was required to do Presumably by nding the center of the circle Prop 31 drawing a line through it and then drawing a second line through it at rightangles to the rst Prop 111 z Proposition 7 To circumscribe a square about a given circle 115STOIQEIWN d ELEMENTS BOOK 4 Let ABCD be the given circle So it is required to circumscribe a square about circle ABCD D H C K B G A F E Let two diameters of circle ABCD AC and BD have been drawn at rightangles to one another And let FG GH HK and KF have been drawn through points A B C and D respectively touching circle ABCD Therefore since FG touches circle ABCD and EA has been joined from the center E to the point of contact A the angles at A are thus rightangles Prop 318 So for the same reasons the angles at points B C and D are also rightangles And since angle AEB is a right angle and EBG is also a rightangle GH is thus parallel to AC Prop 129 So for the same reasons AC is also parallel to FK So that GH is also parallel to FK Prop 130 So similarly we can show that GF and HK are each parallel to BED Thus GK GC AK FB and BK are all parallelograms Thus GF is equal to HK and GH to FK Prop 134 And since AC is equal to BD but AC is also equal to each of GH and FK and BD is equal to each of GF and HK Prop 134 and each of GH and FK is thus equal to each of GF and HK the quadrilateral FGHK is thus equilateral So I say that it is also rightangled For since GBEA is a parallelogram and AEB is a rightangle AGB is thus also a rightangle Prop 134 So similarly we can show that the angles at H K and F are also rightangles Thus FGHK is rightangled And it was also shown to be equilateral Thus it is a square Def 122 And it has been circumscribed about circle ABCD Thus a square has been circumscribed about the given circle Which is the very thing it was required to do See the footnote to the previous proposition See the footnote to Prop 334 116STOIQEIWN d ELEMENTS BOOK 4 h Proposition 8 To inscribe a circle in a given square Let the given square be ABCD So it is required to inscribe a circle in square ABCD G A E D K F B H C Let AD and AB each have been cut in half at points E and F respectively Prop 110 And let EH have been drawn through E parallel to either of AB or CD and let FK have been drawn through F parallel to either of AD or BC Prop 131 Thus AK KB AH HD AG GC BG and GD are each parallelograms and their opposite sides are manifestly equal Prop 134 And since AD is equal to AB and AE is half of AD and AF half of AB AE is thus also equal to AF So that the opposite sides are also equal Thus FG is also equal to GE So similarly we can also show that each of GH and GK is equal to each of FG and GE Thus the four straight lines GE GF GH and GK are equal to one another Thus the circle drawn with center G and radius one of E F H or K will also go through the remaining points And it will touch the straightlines AB BC CD and DA on account of the angles at E F H and K being rightangles For if the circle cuts AB BC CD or DA then a straightline drawn at rightangles to a diameter of the circle from its extremity will fall inside the circle The very thing was shown to be absurd Prop 316 Thus the circle drawn with center G and radius one of E F H or K does not cut the straightlines AB BC CD or DA Thus it will touch them and will have been inscribed in the square ABCD Thus a circle has been inscribed in the given square Which is the very thing it was required to do j Proposition 9 To circumscribe a circle about a given square Let ABCD be the given square So it is required to circumscribe a circle about square ABCD 117STOIQEIWN d ELEMENTS BOOK 4 AC and BD being joined let them cut one another at E C B A E D And since DA is equal to AB and AC is common the two straightlines DA AC are thus equal to the two straightlines BA AC And the base DC is equal to the base BC Thus angle DAC is equal to angle BAC Prop 18 Thus the angle DAB has been cut in half by AC So similarly we can show that ABC BCD and CDA have each been cut in half by the straightlines AC and DB And since angle DAB is equal to ABC and EAB is half of DAB and EBA half of ABC EAB is thus also equal to EBA So that side EA is also equal to EB Prop 16 So similarly we can show that each of the straightlines EA and EB are also equal to each of EC and ED Thus the four straightlines EA EB EC and ED are equal to one another Thus the circle drawn with center E and radius one of A B C or D will also go through the remaining points and will have been circumscribed about the square ABCD Let it have been so circumscribed like ABCD in the gure Thus a circle has been circumscribed about the given square Which is the very thing it was required to do i Proposition 10 To construct an isosceles triangle having each of the angles at the base double the remaining angle Let some straightline AB be taken and let it have been cut at point C so that the rectangle contained by AB and BC is equal to the square on CA Prop 211 And let the circle BDE have been drawn with center A and radius AB And let the straightline BD equal to the straightline AC being not greater than the diame ter of circle BDE have been inserted into circle BDE Prop 41 And let AD and DC have been joined And let the circle ACD have been circumscribed about trian gle ACD Prop 45 118STOIQEIWN d ELEMENTS BOOK 4 C D A E B And since the rectangle contained by AB and BC is equal to the square on AC and AC is equal to BD the rectangle contained by AB and BC is thus equal to the square on BD And since some point B has been taken outside of circle ACD and two straight lines BA and BD have radiated from B towards the cir cle ACD and one of them cuts the circle and the other meets the circle and the rectangle contained by AB and BC is equal to the square on BD BD thus touches circle ACD Prop 337 Therefore since BD touches the circle and DC has been drawn across the circle from the point of contact D the angle BDC is thus equal to the angle DAC in the alternate segment of the circle Prop 332 Therefore since BDC is equal to DAC let CDA have been added to both Thus the whole of BDA is equal to the two angles CDA and DAC But the external angle BCD is equal to CDA and DAC Prop 132 Thus BDA is also equal to BCD But BDA is equal to CBD since the side AD is also equal to AB Prop 15 So that DBA is also equal to BCD Thus the three angles BDA DBA and BCD are equal to one another And since angle DBC is equal to BCD side BD is also equal to side DC Prop 16 But BD was assumed to be equal to CA Thus CA is also equal to CD So that angle CDA is also equal to angle DAC Prop 15 Thus CDA and DAC is double DAC But BCD is equal to CDA and DAC Thus BCD is also double CAD And BCD is equal to to each of BDA and DBA Thus BDA and DBA are each double DAB Thus the isosceles triangle ABD has been con structed having each of the angles at the base BD double the remaining angle Which is the very thing it was required to do ia Proposition 11 To inscribe an equilateral and equiangular pentagon 119STOIQEIWN d ELEMENTS BOOK 4 in a given circle D A B C F G H E Let ABCDE be the given circle So it is required to inscribed an equilateral and equiangular pentagon in cir cle ABCDE Let the the isosceles triangle FGH be set up hav ing each of the angles at G and H double the angle at F Prop 410 And let triangle ACD equiangular to FGH have been inscribed in circle ABCDE such that CAD is equal to the angle at F and the angles at G and H are equal to ACD and CDA respectively Prop 42 Thus ACD and CDA are each double CAD So let ACD and CDA have been cut in half by the straightlines CE and DB respectively Prop 19 And let AB BC DE and EA have been joined Therefore since angles ACD and CDA are each dou ble CAD and are cut in half by the straightlines CE and DB the ve angles DAC ACE ECD CDB and BDA are thus equal to one another And equal angles stand upon equal circumferences Prop 326 Thus the ve circumferences AB BC CD DE and EA are equal to one another Prop 329 Thus the pentagon ABCDE is equilateral So I say that it is also equiangular For since the circumference AB is equal to the circumfer ence DE let BCD have been added to both Thus the whole circumference ABCD is equal to the whole cir cumference EDCB And the angle AED stands upon circumference ABCD and angle BAE upon circumfer ence EDCB Thus angle BAE is also equal to AED Prop 327 So for the same reasons each of the an gles ABC BCD and CDE is also equal to each of BAE and AED Thus pentagon ABCDE is equiangular And it was also shown to be equilateral Thus an equilateral and equiangular pentagon has been inscribed in the given circle Which is the very thing it was required to do ib Proposition 12 To circumscribe an equilateral and equiangular pen tagon about a given circle 120STOIQEIWN d ELEMENTS BOOK 4 H A B K C L D F G E M Let ABCDE be the given circle So it is required to circumscribe an equilateral and equiangular pentagon about circle ABCDE Let A B C D and E have been conceived as the an gular points of a pentagon having been inscribed in cir cle ABCDE Prop 311 such that the circumferences AB BC CD DE and EA are equal And let GH HK KL LM and MG have been drawn through points A B C D and E respectively touching the circle And let the center F of the circle ABCDE have been found Prop 31 And let FB FK FC FL and FD have been joined And since the straightline KL touches circle ABCDE at C and FC has been joined from the center F to the point of contact C FC is thus perpendicular to KL Prop 318 Thus each of the angles at C is a right angle So for the same reasons the angles at B and D are also rightangles And since angle FCK is a right angle the square on FK is thus equal to the sum of the squares on FC and CK Prop 147 So for the same reasons the square on FK is also equal to the sum of the squares on FB and BK So that the sum of the squares on FC and CK is equal to the sum of the squares on FB and BK of which the square on FC is equal to the square on FB Thus the remain ing square on CK is equal to the remaining square on BK Thus BK is equal to CK And since FB is equal to FC and FK is common the two straight lines BF FK are equal to the two straightlines CF FK And the base BK is equal to the base CK Thus angle BFK is equal to angle KFC Prop 18 And BKF is equal to FKC Prop 18 Thus BFC is double KFC and BKC is double FKC So for the same reasons CFD is also double CFL and DLC is also double FLC And since circumference BC is equal to CD angle BFC is also equal to CFD Prop 327 And BFC is double KFC and DFC is double LFC Thus KFC is also equal to LFC And angle FCK is also equal to FCL So FKC and FLC are two triangles hav 121STOIQEIWN d ELEMENTS BOOK 4 ing two angles equal to two angles and one side equal to one side namely their common side FC Thus they will also have the remaining sides equal to the cor responding remaining sides and the remaining angle to the remaining angle Prop 126 Thus the straightline KC is equal to CL and the angle FKC to FLC And since KC is equal to CL KL is thus double KC So for the same reasons it can be shown that HK is also double BK And BK is equal to KC Thus HK is also equal to KL So similarly each of HG GM and ML can also be shown to be equal to each of HK and KL Thus pentagon GHKLM is equilateral So I say that it is also equiangular For since angle FKC is equal to FLC and HKL was shown to be double FKC and KLM double FLC HKL is thus also equal to KLM So similarly each of KHG HGM and GML can also be shown to be equal to each of HKL and KLM Thus the ve angles GHK HKL KLM LMG and MGH are equal to one another Thus the pentagon GHKLM is equiangular And it was also shown to be equilateral and has been circumscribed about circle ABCDE Thus an equilateral and equiangular pentagon has been circumscribed about the given circle Which is the very thing it was required to do See the footnote to Prop 334 ig Proposition 13 To inscribe a circle in a given pentagon which is equi lateral and equiangular H A G B C K D L E M F Let ABCDE be the given equilateral and equiangular pentagon So it is required to inscribe a circle in pentagon ABCDE For let angles BCD and CDE have each been cut in half by each of the straightlines CF and DF re spectively Prop 19 And from the point F at which the straightlines CF and DF meet one another let the 122STOIQEIWN d ELEMENTS BOOK 4 straightlines FB FA and FE have been joined And since BC is equal to CD and CF is common the two straightlines BC CF are equal to the two straight lines DC CF And angle BCF is equal to angle DCF Thus the base BF is equal to the base DF and triangle BCF is equal to triangle DCF and the remain ing angles will be equal to the corresponding remain ing angles which the equal sides subtend Prop 14 Thus angle CBF is equal to CDF And since CDE is double CDF and CDE is equal to ABC and CDF to CBF CBA is thus also double CBF Thus angle ABF is equal to FBC Thus angle ABC has been cut in half by the straightline BF So similarly it can be shown that BAE and AED have been cut in half by the straightlines FA and FE respectively So let FG FH FK FL and FM have been drawn from point F per pendicular to the straightlines AB BC CD DE and EA respectively Prop 112 And since angle HCF is equal to KCF and the rightangle FHC is also equal to the rightangle FKC FHC and FKC are two tri angles having two angles equal to two angles and one side equal to one side namely their common side FC subtending one of the equal angles Thus they will also have the remaining sides equal to the corresponding remaining sides Prop 126 Thus the perpendicular FH is equal to the perpendicular FK So similarly it can be shown that FL FM and FG are each equal to each of FH and FK Thus the ve straightlines FG FH FK FL and FM are equal to one another Thus the circle drawn with center F and radius one of G H K L or M will also go through the remaining points and will touch the straightlines AB BC CD DE and EA on account of the angles at points G H K L and M being rightangles For if it does not touch them but cuts them it follows that a straightline drawn at right angles to the diameter of the circle from its extremity falls inside the circle The very thing was shown to be absurd Prop 316 Thus the circle drawn with center F and radius one of G H K L or M does not cut the straightlines AB BC CD DE or EA Thus it will touch them Let it have been drawn like GHKLM in the gure Thus a circle has been inscribed in the given pen tagon which is equilateral and equiangular Which is the very thing it was required to do id Proposition 14 To circumscribe a circle about a given pentagon which is equilateral and equiangular Let ABCDE be the given pentagon which is equilat 123STOIQEIWN d ELEMENTS BOOK 4 eral and equiangular So it is required to circumscribe a circle about the pentagon ABCDE F A B C D E So let angles BCD and CDE have been cut in half by the straightlines CF and DF respectively Prop 19 And let the straightlines FB FA and FE have been joined from point F at which the straightlines meet to the points B A and E respectively So similarly to the proposition before this one it can be shown that angles CBA BAE and AED have also been cut in half by the straightlines FB FA and FE respec tively And since angle BCD is equal to CDE and FCD is half of BCD and CDF half of CDE FCD is thus also equal to FDC So that side FC is also equal to side FD Prop 16 So similarly it can be shown that FB FA and FE are also each equal to each of FC and FD Thus the ve straightlines FA FB FC FD and FE are equal to one another Thus the circle drawn with center F and radius one of FA FB FC FD or FE will also go through the remaining points and will have been circumscribed Let it have been so circumscribed and let it be ABCDE Thus a circle has been circumscribed about the given pentagon which is equilateral and equiangular Which is the very thing it was required to do ie Proposition 15 To inscribe an equilateral and equiangular hexagon in a given circle Let ABCDEF be the given circle So it is required to inscribe an equilateral and equiangular hexagon in circle ABCDEF Let the diameter AD of circle ABCDEF have been drawn and let the center G of the circle have been

F respectively And let AB BC CD DE EF and FA have been joined I say that the hexagon ABCDEF is equilateral and equiangular C H D B A G F E For since point G is the center of circle ABCDEF GE is equal to GD Again since point D is the cen ter of circle GCH DE is equal to DG But GE was shown to be equal to GD Thus GE is also equal to ED Thus triangle EGD is equilateral Thus its three angles EGD GDE and DEG are also equal to one an other inasmuch as the angles at the base of isosceles tri angles are equal to one another Prop 15 And the three angles of the triangle are equal to two rightangles Prop 132 Thus angle EGD is one third of two right angles So similarly DGC can also be shown to be one third of two rightangles And since the straightline CG standing on EB makes adjacent angles EGC and CGB equal to two rightangles Prop 113 the remain ing angle CGB is thus also one third of two rightangles Thus angles EGD DGC and CGB are equal to one an other And hence the angles opposite to them BGA AGF and FGE are also equal to EGD DGC and CGB respectively Prop 115 Thus the six angles EGD DGC CGB BGA AGF and FGE are equal to one another And equal angles stand on equal cir cumferences Prop 326 Thus the six circumferences AB BC CD DE EF and FA are equal to one an other And equal circumferences are subtended by equal straightlines Prop 329 Thus the six straightlines AB BC CD DE EF and FA are equal to one another Thus hexagon ABCDEF is equilateral So I say that it is also equiangular For since circumfer ence FA is equal to circumference ED let circumference ABCD have been added to both Thus the whole of FABCD is equal to the whole of EDCBA And angle FED stands on circumference FABCD and angle AFE on circumference EDCBA Thus angle AFE is equal 125STOIQEIWN d ELEMENTS BOOK 4 to DEF Prop 327 Similarly it can also be shown that the remaining angles of hexagon ABCDEF are in dividually equal to each of the angles AFE and FED Thus hexagon ABCDEF is equiangular And it was also shown to be equilateral And it has been inscribed in circle ABCDE Thus an equilateral and equiangular hexagon has been inscribed in the given circle Which is the very thing it was required to do Pri sma Corollary So from this it is manifest that a side of the hexagon is equal to the radius of the circle And similarly to a pentagon if we draw tangents to the circle through the sixfold divisions of the cir cumference of the circle an equilateral and equiangu lar hexagon can be circumscribed about the circle analo gously to the aforementioned pentagon And further by means similar to the aforementioned pentagon we can inscribe and circumscribe a circle in and about a given hexagon Which is the very thing it was required to do See the footnote to Prop 46 i Proposition 16 To inscribe an equilateral and equiangular fteen sided gure in a given circle A B E C D Let ABCD be the given circle So it is required to in scribe an equilateral and equiangular fteensided gure in circle ABCD Let the side AC of an equilateral triangle inscribed in the circle Prop 42 and the side AB of an in scribed equilateral pentagon Prop 411 have been in scribed in circle ABCD Thus just as the circle ABCD is made up of fteen equal pieces the circumference ABC being a third of the circle will be made up of ve 126STOIQEIWN d ELEMENTS BOOK 4 such pieces and the circumference AB being a fth of the circle will be made up of three Thus the remain der BC will be made up of two equal pieces Let cir cumference BC have been cut in half at E Prop 330 Thus each of the circumferences BE and EC is one f teenth of the circle ABCDE Thus if joining BE and EC we continuously in sert straightlines equal to them into circle ABCDE Prop 41 then an equilateral and equiangular fteen sided gure will have been inserted into the circle Which is the very thing it was required to do And similarly to the pentagon if we draw tangents to the circle through the fteenfold divisions of the cir cumference of the circle we can circumscribe an equilat eral and equiangular fteensided gure about the circle And further through similar proofs to the pentagon we can also inscribe and circumscribe a circle in and about a given fteensided gure Which is the very thing it was required to do 127128ELEMENTS BOOK 5 Proportion The theory of proportion set out in this book is generally attributed to Eudoxus of Cnidus The novel feature of this theory is its ability to deal with irrational magnitudes which had hitherto been a major stumbling block for Greek mathematicians Throughout the footnotes in this book etc denote general possibly irrational magnitudes whereas m n l etc denote positive integers 129STOIQEIWN e ELEMENTS BOOK 5 V Oroi Denitions 1 A magnitude is a part of another magnitude the lesser of the greater when it measures the greater 2 And the greater magnitude is a multiple of the lesser when it is measured by the lesser 3 A ratio is a certain type of condition with respect to size of two magnitudes of the same kind 4 Those magnitudes are said to have a ratio with re spect to one another which being multiplied are capable of exceeding one another 5 Magnitudes are said to be in the same ratio the rst to the second and the third to the fourth when equal multiples of the rst and the third either both exceed are both equal to or are both less than equal multiples of the second and the fourth respectively being taken in corre sponding order according to any kind of multiplication whatever 6 And let magnitudes having the same ratio be called proportional 7 And when for equal multiples as in Def 5 the multiple of the rst magnitude exceeds the multiple of the second and the multiple of the third magnitude does not exceed the multiple of the fourth then the rst magnitude is said to have a greater ratio to the second than the third magnitude has to the fourth 8 And a proportion in three terms is the smallest possible 9 And when three magnitudes are proportional the rst is said to have to the third the squared ratio of that it has to the second 10 And when four magnitudes are continuously proportional the rst is said to have to the fourth the cubed ratio of that it has to the second And so on similarly in successive order whatever the continuous proportion might be 11 These magnitudes are said to be corresponding magnitudes the leading to the leading of two ratios and the following to the following 12 An alternate ratio is a taking of the ratio of the leading magnitude to the leading of two equal ratios and setting it equal to the ratio of the following mag nitude to the following 13 An inverse ratio is a taking of the ratio of the fol lowing magnitude as the leading and the leading mag nitude as the following 14 A composition of a ratio is a taking of the ratio of the leading plus the following magnitudes as one to the following magnitude by itself 130STOIQEIWN e ELEMENTS BOOK 5 15 A separation of a ratio is a taking of the ratio of the excess by which the leading magnitude exceeds the following to the following magnitude by itself 16 A conversion of a ratio is a taking of the ratio of the leading magnitude to the excess by which the leading magnitude exceeds the following 17 There being several magnitudes and other mag nitudes of equal number to them which are also in the same ratio taken two by two a ratio via equality or ex aequali occurs when as the rst is to the last in the rst set of magnitudes so the rst is to the last in the sec ond set of magnitudes Or alternately it is a taking of the ratio of the outer magnitudes by the removal of the inner magnitudes 18 There being three magnitudes and other magni tudes of equal number to them a perturbed proportion occurs when as the leading is to the following in the rst set of magnitudes so the leading is to the following in the second set of magnitudes and as the following is to some other ie the remaining magnitude in the rst set of magnitudes so some other is to the leading in the second set of magnitudes In other words is said to be a part of if m In modern notation the ratio of two magnitudes and is denoted In other words has a ratio with respect to if m and n for some m and n In other words if and only if m n whenever m n and m n whenever m n and m n whenever m n for all m and n This denition is the kernel of Eudoxus theory of proportion and is valid even if etc are irrational Thus if and have the same ratio as and then they are proportional In modern notation In modern notation a proportion in three terms and is written Literally double In other words if then 2 2 Literally triple In other words if then 3 3 In other words if then the alternate ratio corresponds to In other words if then the inverse ratio corresponds to In other words if then the composed ratio corresponds to In other words if then the separated ratio corresponds to In other words if then the converted ratio corresponds to In other words if are the rst set of magnitudes and the second set and then the ratio via equality or ex aequali corresponds to In other words if are the rst set of magnitudes and the second set and as well as then the proportion is said to be perturbed a Proposition 1 If there are any number of magnitudes whatsoever which are equal multiples respectively of some other magnitudes of equal number to them then as many 131STOIQEIWN e ELEMENTS BOOK 5 times as one of the rst magnitudes is divisible by one of the second so many times will all of the rst magnitudes also be divisible by all of the second F A G B C H D E Let there be any number of magnitudes whatsoever AB CD which are equal multiples respectively of some other magnitudes E F of equal number to them I say that as many times as AB is divisible by E so many times will AB CD also be divisible by E F For since AB CD are equal multiples of E F thus as many magnitudes as there are in AB equal to E so many are there also in CD equal to F Let AB have been divided into magnitudes AG GB equal to E and CD into magnitudes CH HD equal to F So the number of divisions AG GB will be equal to the num ber of divisions CH HD And since AG is equal to E and CH to F AG is thus equal to E and AG CH to E F So for the same reasons GB is equal to E and GB HD to E F Thus as many magnitudes as there are in AB equal to E so many are there also in AB CD equal to E F Thus as many times as AB is divisible by E so many times will AB CD also be divisible by E F Thus if there are any number of magnitudes what soever which are equal multiples respectively of some other magnitudes of equal number to them then as many times as one of the rst magnitudes is divisi ble by one of the second so many times will all of the rst magnitudes also be divisible by all of the second Which is the very thing it was required to show In modern notation this proposition reads m m m b Proposition 2 If a rst magnitude and a third are equal multiples of a second and a fourth respectively and a fth mag nitude and a sixth are also equal multiples of the sec ond and fourth respectively then the rst magnitude and the fth being added together and the third and the sixth being added together will also be equal multiples of the second magnitude and the fourth respectively For let a rst magnitude AB and a third DE be equal multiples of a second C and a fourth F respec tively And let a fth magnitude BG and a sixth EH also be other equal multiples of the second C and the fourth F respectively I say that the rst magnitude and the fth being added together to give AG and the third magnitude and the sixth being added together 132STOIQEIWN e ELEMENTS BOOK 5 to give DH will also be equal multiples of the second magnitude C and the fourth F respectively H A B G C F D E For since AB and DE are equal multiples of C and F respectively thus as many magnitudes as there are in AB equal to C so many are there also in DE equal to F And so for the same reasons as many magnitudes as there are in BG equal to C so many are there also in EH equal to F Thus as many magnitudes as there are in the whole of AG equal to C so many are there also in the whole of DH equal to F Thus as many times as AG is divisible by C so many times will DH also be divisible by F Thus the rst magnitude and the fth being added together to give AG and the third magnitude and the sixth being added together to give DH will also be equal multiples of the second magnitude C and the fourth F respectively Thus if a rst magnitude and a third are equal mul tiples of a second and a fourth respectively and a fth magnitude and a sixth are also equal multiples of the second and fourth respectively then the rst magni tude and the fth being added together and the third and sixth being added together will also be equal mul tiples of the second magnitude and the fourth respec tively Which is the very thing it was required to show In modern notation this propostion reads m n m n g Proposition 3 If a rst magnitude and a third are equal multiples of a second and a fourth respectively and equal multi ples are taken of the rst and the third then via equality the magnitudes taken will also be equal multiples of the second magnitude and the fourth respectively For let a rst magnitude A and a third C be equal multiples of a second B and a fourth D respectively and let the equal multiples EF and GH have been taken of A and C respectively I say that EF and GH are equal multiples of B and D respectively For since EF and GH are equal multiples of A and C respectively thus as many magnitudes as there are in EF equal to A so many are there also in GH 133STOIQEIWN e ELEMENTS BOOK 5 equal to C Let EF have been divided into magnitudes EK KF equal to A and GH into magnitudes GL LH equal to C So the number of magnitudes EK KF will be equal to the number of magnitudes GL LH And since A and C are equal multiples of B and D re spectively and EK is equal to A and GL to C EK and GL are thus equal multiples of B and D respec tively So for the same reasons KF and LH are equal multiples of B and D respectively Therefore since the rst magnitude EK and the third GL are equal mul tiples of the second B and the fourth D respectively and the fth magnitude KF and the sixth LH are also equal multiples of the second B and the fourth D re spectively then the rst magnitude and fth being added together to give EF and the third magnitude and sixth being added together to give GH are thus also equal multiples of the second magnitude B and the fourth D respectively Prop 52 A E K F H G C D B L Thus if a rst magnitude and a third are equal mul tiples of a second and a fourth respectively and equal multiples are taken of the rst and the third then via equality the magnitudes taken will also be equal mul tiples of the second magnitude and the fourth respec tively Which is the very thing it was required to show In modern notation this proposition reads mn m n d Proposition 4 If a rst magnitude has the same ratio to a second that a third has to a fourth then equal multiples of the rst magnitude and the third will also have the same ratio to equal multiples of the second and the fourth be ing taken in corresponding order according to any kind of multiplication whatsoever For let a rst magnitude A have the same ratio to a second B that a third C has to a fourth D And let equal multiples E and F have been taken of A and C respectively and other random equal multiples G and 134STOIQEIWN e ELEMENTS BOOK 5 H of B and D respectively I say that as E is to G so F is to H N A B E G K M C D F H L For let equal multiples K and L have been taken of E and F respectively and other random equal multiples M and N of G and H respectively And since E and F are equal multiples of A and C respectively and the equal multiples K and L have been taken of E and F respectively K and L are thus equal multiples of A and C respectively Prop 53 So for the same reasons M and N are equal multiples of B and D respectively And since as A is to B so C is to D and the equal multiples K and L have been taken of A and C respectively and the other random equal multiples M and N of B and D respectively then if K exceeds M then L also exceeds N and if K is equal to M then L is also equal to N and if K is less than M then L is also less than N Def 55 And K and L are equal multiples of E and F respectively and M and N other random equal multiples of G and H respectively Thus as E is to G so F is to H Def 55 Thus if a rst magnitude has the same ratio to a second that a third has to a fourth then equal multi ples of the rst magnitude and the third will also have the same ratio to equal multiples of the second and the fourth being taken in corresponding order according to any kind of multiplication whatsoever Which is the very thing it was required to show In modern notation this proposition reads that if then m n m n for all m and n 135STOIQEIWN e ELEMENTS BOOK 5 e Proposition 5 If a magnitude is the same multiple of a magnitude that a part taken away is of a part taken away re spectively then the remainder will also be the same mul tiple of the remainder as that which the whole is of the whole respectively D A G C E F B For let the magnitude AB be the same multiple of the magnitude CD that the part taken away AE is of the part taken away CF respectively I say that the re mainder EB will also be the same multiple of the remain der FD as that which the whole AB is of the whole CD respectively For as many times as AE is divisible by CF so many times let EB also have been made divisible by CG And since AE and EB are equal multiples of CF and GC respectively AE and AB are thus equal multiples of CF and GF respectively Prop 51 And AE and AB are assumed to be equal multiples of CF and CD respectively Thus AB is an equal multiple of each of GF and CD Thus GF is equal to CD Let CF have been subtracted from both Thus the remainder GC is equal to the remainder FD And since AE and EB are equal multiples of CF and GC respectively and GC is equal to DF AE and EB are thus equal multiples of CF and FD respectively And AE and AB are assumed to be equal multiples of CF and CD respectively Thus EB and AB are equal multiples of FD and CD respectively Thus the remainder EB will also be the same multiple of the remainder FD as that which the whole AB is of the whole CD respectively Thus if a magnitude is the same multiple of a magni tude that a part taken away is of a part taken away respectively then the remainder will also be the same multiple of the remainder as that which the whole is of the whole respectively Which is the very thing it was required to show In modern notation this proposition reads m m m Proposition 6 If two magnitudes are equal multiples of two other magnitudes and some parts taken away from the for mer magnitudes are equal multiples of the latter mag nitudes respectively then the remainders are also either equal to the latter magnitudes or are equal multiples 136STOIQEIWN e ELEMENTS BOOK 5 of them respectively For let two magnitudes AB and CD be equal multi ples of two magnitudes E and F respectively And let the parts taken away from the former AG and CH be equal multiples of E and F respectively I say that the remainders GB and HD are also either equal to E and F respectively or are equal multiples of them F G B C H D A K E For let GB be rst of all equal to E I say that HD is also equal to F For let CK be made equal to F Since AG and CH are equal multiples of E and F respectively and GB is equal to E and KC to F AB and KH are thus equal multiples of E and F respectively Prop 52 And AB and CD are assumed to be equal multiples of E and F respectively Thus KH and CD are equal multiples of F and F respectively Therefore KH and CD are each equal multiples of F Thus KH is equal to CD Let CH have be taken away from both Thus the remainder KC is equal to the remainder HD But F is equal to KC Thus HD is also equal to F Hence if GB is equal to E then HD will also be equal to F So similarly we can show that even if GB is a multi ple of E then HD will also be the same multiple of F Thus if two magnitudes are equal multiples of two other magnitudes and some parts taken away from the former magnitudes are equal multiples of the latter magnitudes respectively then the remainders are also either equal to the latter magnitudes or are equal multiples of them respectively Which is the very thing it was required to show In modern notation this proposition reads m n m n z Proposition 7 Equal magnitudes have the same ratio to the same magnitude and the latter magnitude has the same ra tio to the equal magnitudes Let A and B be equal magnitudes and C some other random magnitude I say that A and B each have the 137STOIQEIWN e ELEMENTS BOOK 5 same ratio to C and that C has the same ratio to each of A and B D B A C F E For let the equal multiples D and E have been taken of A and B respectively and the other random multiple F of C Therefore since D and E are equal multiples of A and B respectively and A is equal to B D is thus also equal to E And F is different at random Thus if D exceeds F then E also exceeds F and if D is equal to F then E is also equal to F and if D is less than F then E is also less than F And D and E are equal multiples of A and B respectively and F another random multiple of C Thus as A is to C so B is to C Def 55 So I say that C also has the same ratio to each of A and B For similarly we can show by the same construction that D is equal to E And F has some other value Thus if F exceeds D then it also exceeds E and if F is equal to D then it is also equal to E and if F is less than D then it is also less than E And F is a multiple of C and D and E other random equal multiples of A and B Thus as C is to A so C is to B Def 55 Thus equal magnitudes have the same ratio to the same magnitude and the latter magnitude has the same ratio to the equal magnitudes Pri sma Corollary So it is clear from this that if some magnitudes are proportional then they will also be proportional inversely Which is the very thing it was required to show The Greek text has E which is obviously a mistake In modern notation this corollary reads that if then h Proposition 8 For unequal magnitudes the greater magnitude has a greater ratio than the lesser to the same magnitude And the latter magnitude has a greater ratio to the lesser magnitude than to the greater Let AB and C be unequal magnitudes and let AB be the greater of the two and D another random magni tude I say that AB has a greater ratio to D than C has to D and that D has a greater ratio to C than it has to AB 138STOIQEIWN e ELEMENTS BOOK 5 G E A B A E B H J Z Z H J G K D L M N N M L D K C E A B A E B K D L M N N M L D K F G H F G H C For since AB is greater than C let BE be made equal to C So the lesser of AE and EB being multiplied will sometimes be greater than D Def 54 First of all let AE be less than EB and let AE have been multiplied and let FG be a multiple of it which is greater than D And as many times as FG is divisible by AE so many times let GH also have become divisible by EB and K by C And let the double multiple L of D have been taken and the triple multiple M and several more each increasing in order by one until the multiple taken becomes the rst multiple of D which is greater than K Let it have been taken and let it also be the quadruple multiple N of Dthe rst multiple greater than K Therefore since K is less than N rst K is thus not less than M And since FG and GH are equal multi ples of AE and EB respectively FG and FH are thus equal multiples of AE and AB respectively Prop 51 And FG and K are equal multiples of AE and C re spectively Thus FH and K are equal multiples of AB and C respectively Thus FH K are equal multiples of AB C Again since GH and K are equal multiples of EB and C and EB is equal to C GH is thus also equal to K And K is not less than M Thus GH not less than M either And FG is greater than D Thus the whole of FH is greater than D and M added together But D and M added together is equal to N inasmuch as M is three times D and M and D added together is four times D and N is also four times D Thus M and D added together is equal to N But FH is greater than M and D Thus FH exceeds N And K does not exceed N And FH K are equal multiples of AB C and N another random multiple of D Thus AB has a greater ratio to D than C has to D Def 57 So I say that D also has a greater ratio to C than D has to AB For similarly by the same construction we can show that N exceeds K and N does not exceed FH And N is a multiple of D and FH K other random equal multiples of AB C respectively Thus D has a greater 139STOIQEIWN e ELEMENTS BOOK 5 ratio to C than D has to AB Def 55 And so let AE be greater than EB So the lesser EB being multiplied will sometimes be greater than D Let it have been multiplied and let GH be a multiple of EB which is greater than D And as many times as GH is divisible by EB so many times let FG also have become divisible by AE and K by C So similarly to the above we can show that FH and K are equal multiples of AB and C respectively And similarly to the above let the multiple N of D which is the rst multiple greater than FG have been taken So FG is again not less than M And GH is greater than D Thus the whole of FH exceeds D and M that is to say N And K does not exceed N inasmuch as FG which is greater than GHthat is to say Kalso does not exceed N And following the above arguments we can complete the proof in the same manner Thus for unequal magnitudes the greater magni tude has a greater ratio than the lesser to the same mag nitude And the latter magnitude has a greater ratio to the lesser magnitude than to the greater Which is the very thing it was required to show j Proposition 9 Magnitudes having the same ratio to the same magnitude are equal to one another And those mag nitudes to which the same magnitude has the same ratio are equal B C A For let A and B each have the same ratio to C I say that A is equal to B For if not A and B would not each have the same ratio to C Prop 58 But they do Thus A is equal to B So again let C have the same ratio to each of A and B I say that A is equal to B For if not C would not have the same ratio to each of A and B Prop 58 But it does Thus A is equal to B Thus magnitudes having the same ratio to the same magnitude are equal to one another And those magni tudes to which the same magnitude has the same ratio are equal Which is the very thing it was required to show i Proposition 10 For magnitudes having a ratio to the same mag nitude that magnitude which has the greater ratio is 140STOIQEIWN e ELEMENTS BOOK 5 the greater And that magnitude to which the latter magnitude has a greater ratio is the lesser C A B For let A have a greater ratio to C than B has to C I say that A is greater than B For if not A is surely either equal to or less than B In fact A is not equal to B For then A and B would each have the same ratio to C Prop 57 But they do not Thus A is not equal to B Neither indeed is A less than B For then A would have a lesser ratio to C than B has to C Prop 58 But it does not Thus A is not less than B And it was shown not to be equal either Thus A is greater than B So again let C have a greater ratio to B than C has to A I say that B is less than A For if not it is surely either equal or greater In fact B is not equal to A For then C would have the same ratio to each of A and B Prop 57 But it does not Thus A is not equal to B Neither indeed is B greater than A For then C would have a lesser ratio to B than it has to A Prop 58 But it does not Thus B is not greater than A And it was shown that it is not equal to A either Thus B is less than A Thus for magnitudes having a ratio to the same magnitude that magnitude which has the greater ratio is the greater And that magnitude to which the latter magnitude has a greater ratio is the lesser Which is the very thing it was required to show ia Proposition 11 Ratios which are the same with the same ratio are also the same with one another N G A B L H M D C E F K For let it be that as A is to B so C is to D and as C is to D so E is to F I say that as A is to B so E is to F For let the equal multiples G H K have been taken of A C E respectively and the other random equal multiples L M N of B D F respectively And since as A is to B so C is to D and the equal multiples G and H have been taken of A and C respec tively and the other random equal multiples L and M of B and D respectively thus if G exceeds L then H also exceeds M and if G is equal to L then H is also 141STOIQEIWN e ELEMENTS BOOK 5 equal to M and if G is less than L then H is also less than M Def 55 Again since as C is to D so E is to F and the equal multiples H and K have been taken of C and E respectively and the other random equal multiples M and N of D and F respectively thus if H exceeds M then K also exceeds N and if H is equal to M then K is also equal to N and if H is less than M then K is also less than N Def 55 But we saw that if H was exceeding M then G was also ex ceeding L and if H was equal to M then G was also equal to L and if H was less than M then G was also less than L And hence if G exceeds L then K also exceeds N and if G is equal to L then K is also equal to N and if G is less than L then K is also less than N And G and K are equal multiples of A and E respectively and L and N other random equal multiples of B and F respectively Thus as A is to B so E is to F Def 55 Thus ratios which are the same with the same ratio are also the same with one another Which is the very thing it was required to show In modern notation this proposition reads that if and then ib Proposition 12 If there are any number of magnitudes whatsoever which are proportional then as one of the leading mag nitudes is to one of the following so will all of the lead ing magnitudes be to all of the following N A C E B D F G H K L M Let there be any number of magnitudes whatsoever A B C D E F which are proportional so that as A is to B so C is to D and E to F I say that as A is to B so A C E are to B D F For let the equal multiples G H K have been taken of A C E respectively and the other random equal multiples L M N of B D F respectively And since as A is to B so C is to D and E to F and the equal multiples G H K have been taken of A C E respectively and the other random equal multiples L M N of B D F respectively thus if G exceeds L then H also exceeds M and K exceeds N and if G is equal to L then H is also equal to M and K to N 142STOIQEIWN e ELEMENTS BOOK 5 and if G is less than L then H is also less than M and K than N Def 55 And hence if G exceeds L then G H K also exceed L M N and if G is equal to L then G H K are also equal to L M N and if G is less than L then G H K are also less than L M N And G and G H K are equal multiples of A and A C E respectively inasmuch as if there are any number of magnitudes whatsoever which are equal multiples respectively of some other magnitudes of equal number to them then as many times as one of the rst magnitudes is divisible by one of the second so many times will all of the rst magnitudes also be divisible by all of the second Prop 51 So for the same reasons L and L M N are also equal multiples of B and B D F respectively Thus as A is to B so A C E are to B D F respectively Thus if there are any number of magnitudes whatso ever which are proportional then as one of the leading magnitudes is to one of the following so will all of the leading magnitudes be to all of the following Which is the very thing it was required to show In modern notation this proposition reads that if etc then ig Proposition 13 If a rst magnitude has the same ratio to a second that a third has to a fourth and the third magnitude has a greater ratio to the fourth than a fth has to a sixth then the rst magnitude will also have a greater ratio to the second than the fth has to the sixth L M N A B C D G K E F H For let a rst magnitude A have the same ratio to a second B that a third C has to a fourth D and let the third magnitude C have a greater ratio to the fourth D than a fth E has to a sixth F I say that the rst magnitude A will also have a greater ratio to the second B than the fth E has to the sixth F For since there are some equal multiples of C and E and other random equal multiples of D and F for which the multiple of C exceeds the multiple of D and the multiple of E does not exceed the multiple of F Def 57 let them have been taken And let G and H be equal multiples of C and E respectively and K and L other random equal multiples of D and F respectively such that G exceeds K but H does not exceed L And as many times as G is divisible by C so many times let M be divisible by A And as many times as K is divisible 143STOIQEIWN e ELEMENTS BOOK 5 by D so many times let N be divisible by B And since as A is to B so C is to D and the equal multiples M and G have been taken of A and C respec tively and the other random equal multiples N and K of B and D respectively thus if M exceeds N then G exceeds K and if M is equal to N then G is also equal to K and if M is less than N then G is also less than K Def 55 And G exceeds K Thus M also exceeds N And H does not exceeds L And M and H are equal multiples of A and E respectively and N and L other random equal multiples of B and F respec tively Thus A has a greater ratio to B than E has to F Def 57 Thus if a rst magnitude has the same ratio to a second that a third has to a fourth and a third magni tude has a greater ratio to a fourth than a fth has to a sixth then the rst magnitude will also have a greater ratio to the second than the fth has to the sixth Which is the very thing it was required to show In modern notation this proposition reads that if and then id Proposition 14 If a rst magnitude has the same ratio to a second that a third has to a fourth and the rst magnitude is greater than the third then the second will also be greater than the fourth And if the rst magnitude is equal to the third then the second will also be equal to the fourth And if the rst magnitude is less than the third then the second will also be less than the fourth C A B D For let a rst magnitude A have the same ratio to a second B that a third C has to a fourth D And let A be greater than C I say that B is also greater than D For since A is greater than C and B is another ran dom magnitude A thus has a greater ratio to B than C has to B Prop 58 And as A is to B so C is to D Thus C also has a greater ratio to D than C has to B And that magnitude to which the same magnitude has a greater ratio is the lesser Prop 510 Thus D is less than B Hence B is greater than D So similarly we can show that even if A is equal to C then B will also be equal to D and even if A is less than C then B will also be less than D Thus if a rst magnitude has the same ratio to a second that a third has to a fourth and the rst mag nitude is greater than the third then the second will also be greater than the fourth And if the rst magnitude is 144STOIQEIWN e ELEMENTS BOOK 5 equal to the third then the second will also be equal to the fourth And if the rst magnitude is less than the third then the second will also be less than the fourth Which is the very thing it was required to show In modern notation this proposition reads that if then as ie Proposition 15 Parts have the same ratio as similar multiples taken in corresponding order E A G H D K L F C B For let AB and DE be equal multiples of C and F respectively I say that as C is to F so AB is to DE For since AB and DE are equal multiples of C and F respectively thus as many magnitudes as there are in AB equal to C so many are there also in DE equal to F Let AB have been divided into magnitudes AG GH HB equal to C and DE into magnitudes DK KL LE equal to F So the number of magnitudes AG GH HB will equal the number of magnitudes DK KL LE And since AG GH HB are equal to one another and DK KL LE are also equal to one another thus as AG is to DK so GH is to KL and HB to LE Prop 57 And thus for proportional magnitudes as one of the leading magnitudes will be to one of the fol lowing so all of the leading magnitudes will be to all of the following Prop 512 Thus as AG is to DK so AB is to DE And AG is equal to C and DK to F Thus as C is to F so AB is to DE Thus parts have the same ratio as similar multiples taken in corresponding order Which is the very thing it was required to show In modern notation this proposition reads that m m i Proposition 16 If four magnitudes are proportional then they will also be proportional alternately Let A B C and D be four proportional magnitudes such that as A is to B so C is to D I say that they will also be proportional alternately so that as A is to C so B is to D For let the equal multiples E and F have been taken of A and B respectively and the other random equal multiples G and H of C and D respectively 145STOIQEIWN e ELEMENTS BOOK 5 H A B E F C D G And since E and F are equal multiples of A and B respectively and parts have the same ratio as similar multiples Prop 515 thus as A is to B so E is to F But as A is to B so C is to D And thus as C is to D so E is to F Prop 511 Again since G and H are equal multiples of C and D respectively thus as C is to D so G is to H Prop 515 But as C is to D so E is to F And thus as E is to F so G is to H Prop 511 And if four magnitudes are proportional and the rst is greater than the third then the second will also be greater than the fourth and if the rst is equal to the third then the second will also be equal to the fourth and if the rst is less than the third then the second will also be less than the fourth Prop 514 Thus if E exceeds G then F also exceeds H and if E is equal to G then F is also equal to H and if E is less than G then F is also less than H And E and F are equal multiples of A and B respectively and G and H other random equal multiples of C and D respectively Thus as A is to C so B is to D Def 55 Thus if four magnitudes are proportional then they will also be proportional alternately Which is the very thing it was required to show In modern notation this proposition reads that if then iz Proposition 17 If composed magnitudes are proportional then they will also be proportional when separarted K A E B F D H P N M O G L C Let AB BE CD and DF be composed magnitudes which are proportional so that as AB is to BE so CD is to DF I say that they will also be proportional when separated so that as AE is to EB so CF is to DF For let the equal multiples GH HK LM and MN have been taken of AE EB CF and FD respectively and the other random equal multiples KO and NP of EB and FD respectively 146STOIQEIWN e ELEMENTS BOOK 5 And since GH and HK are equal multiples of AE and EB respectively GH and GK are thus equal multiples of AE and AB respectively Prop 51 But GH and LM are equal multiples of AE and CF respectively Thus GK and LM are equal multiples of AB and CF respectively Again since LM and MN are equal mul tiples of CF and FD respectively LM and LN are thus equal multiples of CF and CD respectively Prop 51 And LM and GK were equal multiples of CF and AB respectively Thus GK and LN are equal multiples of AB and CD respectively Thus GK LN are equal multiples of AB CD Again since HK and MN are equal multiples of EB and FD respectively and KO and NP are also equal multiples of EB and FD respec tively then added together HO and MP are also equal multiples of EB and FD respectively Prop 52 And since as AB is to BE so CD is to DF and the equal multiples GK LN have been taken of AB CD and the equal multiples HO MP of EB FD thus if GK exceeds HO then LN also exceeds MP and if GK is equal to HO then LN is also equal to MP and if GK is less than HO then LN is also less than MP Def 55 So let GK exceed HO and thus HK being taken away from both GH exceeds KO But we saw that if GK was exceeding HO then LN was also exceeding MP Thus LN also exceeds MP and MN being taken away from both LM also exceeds NP Hence if GH exceeds KO then LM also exceeds NP So similarly we can show that even if GH is equal to KO then LM will also be equal to NP and even if GH is less than KO then LM will also be less than NP And GH LM are equal multiples of AE CF and KO NP other random equal multiples of EB FD Thus as AE is to EB so CF is to FD Def 55 Thus if composed magnitudes are proportional then they will also be proportional when separarted Which is the very thing it was required to show In modern notation this proposition reads that if then ih Proposition 18 If separated magnitudes are proportional then they will also be proportional when composed C A B D G F E Let AE EB CF and FD be separated magnitudes which are proportional so that as AE is to EB so CF is to FD I say that they will also be proportional 147STOIQEIWN e ELEMENTS BOOK 5 when composed so that as AB is to BE so CD is to FD For if it is not the case that as AB is to BE so CD is to FD then it will surely be the case that as AB is to BE so CD is either to some magnitude less than DF or some magnitude greater than DF Let it rst of all be to some magnitude less than DF namely DG And since composed magnitudes are proportional so that as AB is to BE so CD is to DG they will thus also be proportional when separated Prop 517 Thus as AE is to EB so CG is to GD But it was also assumed that as AE is to EB so CF is to FD Thus it is also the case that as CG is to GD so CF is to FD Prop 511 And the rst magnitude CG is greater than the third CF Thus the second magnitude GD is also greater than the fourth FD Prop 514 But it is also less The very thing is impossible Thus it is not the case that as AB is to BE so CD is to less than FD Similarly we can show that neither is it the case to greater than FD Thus it is the case to the same as FD Thus if separated magnitudes are proportional then they will also be proportional when composed Which is the very thing it was required to show In modern notation this proposition reads that if then Here Euclid assumes without proof that a fourth magnitude proportional to three given magnitudes can always be found ij Proposition 19 If as the whole is to the whole so the part taken away is to the part taken away then the remainder to the remainder will also be as the whole is to the whole D A C E F B For let the whole AB be to the whole CD as the part taken away AE is to the part taken away CF I say that the remainder EB to the remainder FD will also be as the whole AB is to the whole CD For since as AB is to CD so AE is to CF it is also the case alternately that as BA is to AE so DC is to CF Prop 516 And since composed magni tudes are proportional then they will also be proportional when separated so that as BE is to EA so DF is to CF Prop 517 Also alternately as BE is to DF so EA is to FC Prop 516 And it was assumed that as AE is to CF so the whole AB is to the whole CD And thus as the remainder EB is to the remainder FD so the whole AB will be to the whole CD 148STOIQEIWN e ELEMENTS BOOK 5 Thus if as the whole is to the whole so the part taken away is to the part taken away then the remain der to the remainder will also be as the whole is to the whole Which is the very thing it was required to show And since it was shown that as AB is to CD so EB is to FD it is also the case alternately that as AB is to BE so CD is to FD Thus composed magnitudes are proportional And it was shown that as BA is to AE so DC is to CF And the latter is converted from the former Pri sma Corollary So it is clear from this that if composed magni tudes are proportional then they will also be proportional when converted Which is the very thing it was re quired to show In modern notation this proposition reads that if then In modern notation this corollary reads that if then k Proposition 20 If there are three magnitudes and others of equal number to them being also in the same ratio taken two by two and if via equality the rst is greater than

will also be less than the sixth F B C A D E Let A B and C be three magnitudes and D E F other magnitudes of equal number to them being in the same ratio taken two by two so that as A is to B so D is

D will also be less than F For since A is greater than C and B some other mag nitude and the greater magnitude has a greater ratio than the lesser to the same magnitude Prop 58 A thus has a greater ratio to B than C has to B But as A is to B so D is to E And inversely as C is to B so F is to E Prop 57 corr Thus D also has a greater ratio to E than F has to E Prop 513 And for mag 149STOIQEIWN e ELEMENTS BOOK 5 nitudes having a ratio to the same magnitude that having the greater ratio is greater Prop 510 Thus D is greater than F Similarly we can show that even if A is equal to C then D will also be equal to F and even if A is less than C then D will also be less than F Thus if there are three magnitudes and others of equal number to them being also in the same ratio taken two by two and if via equality the rst is greater than the third then the fourth will also be greater than the sixth And if the rst is equal to the third then the fourth will also be equal to the sixth And if the

E is to F And inversely as C is to B so E is to D Prop 57 corr Thus E also has a greater ratio to F than E has to D Prop 513 And that magnitude to which the same magnitude has a greater ratio is the lesser magni tude Prop 510 Thus F is less than D Thus D is greater than F Similarly we can show that even if A is equal to C then D will also be equal to F and even if A is less than C then D will also be less than F 150STOIQEIWN e ELEMENTS BOOK 5 Thus if there are three magnitudes and others of equal number to them being also in the same ratio taken two by two and if their proportion is per turbed and if via equality the rst is greater than the third then the fourth will also be greater than the sixth And if the rst is equal to the third then the fourth will also be equal to the sixth And if the rst is less than the third then the fourth will also be less than the sixth Which is the very thing it was required to show In modern notation this proposition reads that if and then as kb

so that as A is to B so D is to E and as B is to C so E is to F I say that they will also be in the same ratio via equality That is as A is to C so D is to F For let the equal multiples G and H have been taken of A and D respectively and the other random equal multiples K and L of B and E respectively and the yet other random equal multiples M and N of C and F respectively And since as A is to B so D is to E and the equal multiples G and H have been taken of A and D respec tively and the other random equal multiples K and L of B and E respectively thus as G is to K so H is to L Prop 54 And so for the same reasons as K is to M so L is to N Therefore since G K and M are three magnitudes and H L and N other magnitudes of equal number to them which are also in the same ratio taken two by two thus via equality if G exceeds M then H also exceeds N and if G is equal to M then H is also equal to N and if G is less than M then H is also less than N Prop 520 And G and H are equal multiples of A

equal multiples G H and K have been taken of A B and D respectively and the other random equal multiples L M and N of C E and F respec tively And since G and H are equal multiples of A and B

spectively thus as C is to E so L is to M Prop 515 But as C is to E so H is to K And thus as H is to K so L is to M Prop 511 Also alternately as H is to L so K is to M Prop 516 And it was also shown that as G is to H so M is to N Therefore since G H and L are three magnitudes and K M and N other magnitudes of equal number to them being in the same ratio taken two by two and their proportion is perturbed thus via equality if G exceeds L then K also exceeds N and if G is equal to L then K is also equal to N and if G is less than L then K is also less than N Prop 521 And G and K are equal mul

notation this proposition reads that if and then kd Proposition 24 If a rst magnitude has to a second the same ratio that third has to a fourth and a fth magnitude also has to the second the same

E C D H F A G B For let a rst magnitude AB have the same ratio to a second C that a third DE has to a fourth F And let a fth magnitude BG also have the same ratio to the second C that a sixth EH has to the fourth F I say that the rst magnitude and the fth added together AG will also have the same ratio to the second C that the third magnitude and the sixth added together DH has to the fourth F For since as BG is to C so EH is to F thus in versely as C is to BG so F is to EH Prop 57 corr Therefore since as AB is to C so DE is to F and as C is to BG so F is to EH thus via equality as AB is to BG so DE is to EH Prop 522 And since separated magnitudes are proportional then they will also be pro portional when composed Prop 518 Thus as AG is to GB so DH is to HE And also as BG is to C so EH is to F Thus via equality as AG is to C so DH is to F Prop 522 Thus if a rst magnitude has to a second the same ratio that a third has to a fourth and a fth magni tude also has to the second the same ratio that a sixth has to the fourth then the rst magnitude and the fth added together will also have the same ratio to the second that the third magnitude and the sixth added 153STOIQEIWN e ELEMENTS

the sum of the largest and the smallest of them is greater than the sum of the remaining two magnitudes F G E H D C A B Let AB CD E and F be four proportional magni tudes such that as AB is to CD so E is to F And let AB be the greatest of them and F the least I say that AB and F is greater than CD and E For let AG be made equal to E and CH equal to F In fact since as AB is to CD so E is to F and E is equal to AG and F to CH thus as AB is to CD so AG is to CH And since the whole AB is to the whole CD as the part taken away AG is to the part taken away CH thus the remainder GB will also be to the remainder HD as the whole AB is to the whole CD Prop 519 And AB is greater than CD Thus GB is also greater than HD And since AG is equal to E and CH to F thus AG and F is equal to CH and E And since if equal magnitudes are added to unequal magnitudes then the wholes are unequal thus if AG and F are added to GB and CH and E to HDGB and HD being unequal and GB greaterit is inferred that AB and F is greater than CD and E Thus if four magnitudes are proportional then the sum of the largest and the smallest of them is greater than the sum of the remaining two magnitudes Which is the very thing it was required to show In modern notation this proposition reads that if and is the greatest and the least then 154ELEMENTS BOOK 6 Similar Figures 155STOIQEIWN ELEMENTS BOOK 6 V Oroi Denitions 1 Similar rectilinear gures are those which have their angles separately equal and the corresponding sides about the equal angles proportional 2 A straightline is said to have been cut in extreme and mean ratio when as the whole is to the greater seg ment so the greater segment is to the lesser 3 The height of any gure is the straightline drawn from the vertex perpendicular to the base a Proposition 1 Triangles and parallelograms which are of the same height are to one another as their bases F H K L E G B C D A Let ABC and ACD be triangles and EC and CF par allelograms of the same height AC I say that as base BC is to base CD so triangle ABC is to triangle ACD and parallelogram EC to parallelogram CF For let the straightline BD have been produced in each direction to points H and L and let any number of straightlines BG and GH be made equal to base BC and any number of straightlines DK and KL equal to base CD And let AG AH AK and AL have been joined And since CB BG and GH are equal to one another triangles AHG AGB and ABC are also equal to one another Prop 138 Thus as many times as base HC is divisible by base BC so many times is triangle AHC also divisible by triangle ABC So for the same rea sons as many times as base LC is divisible by base CD so many times is triangle ALC also divisible by triangle ACD And if base HC is equal to base CL then triangle AHC is also equal to triangle ACL Prop 138 And if base HC exceeds base CL then triangle AHC also exceeds triangle ACL And if HC is less than CL then AHC is also less than ACL So their being four magnitudes two bases BC and CD and two trian 156STOIQEIWN ELEMENTS BOOK 6 gles ABC and ACD equal multiples have been taken of base BC and triangle ABCnamely base HC and tri angle AHCand other random equal multiples of base CD and triangle ADCnamely base LC and triangle ALC And it has been shown that if base HC exceeds base CL then triangle AHC also exceeds triangle ALC and if HC is equal to CL then AHC is also equal to ALC and if HC is less than CL then AHC is also less than ALC Thus as base BC is to base CD so triangle ABC is to triangle ACD Def 55 And since parallelogram EC is double triangle ABC and parallelo gram FC is double triangle ACD Prop 134 and parts have the same ratio as similar multiples Prop 515 thus as triangle ABC is to triangle ACD so parallelogram EC is to parallelogram FC In fact since it was shown that as base BC is to CD so triangle ABC is to triangle ACD and as triangle ABC is to triangle ACD so par allelogram EC is to parallelogram CF thus also as base BC is to base CD so parallelogram EC is to parallelogram FC Prop 511 Thus triangles and parallelograms which are of the same height are to one another as their bases Which is the very thing it was required to show As is easily demonstrated this proposition holds even when the triangles or parallelograms do not share a common side andor are not rightangled This is a straightforward generalization of Prop 138 b Proposition 2 If some straightline is drawn parallel to one of the sides of a triangle then it will cut the other sides of the triangle proportionally And if two of the sides of a tri angle are cut proportionally then the straightline joining the cutting points will be parallel to the remaining side of the triangle A C B D E For let DE have been drawn parallel to one of the sides BC of triangle ABC I say that as BD is to DA so CE is to EA 157STOIQEIWN ELEMENTS BOOK 6 For let BE and CD have been joined Thus triangle BDE is equal to triangle CDE For they are on the same base DE and between the same parallels DE and BC Prop 138 And ADE is some other triangle And equal magnitudes have the same ra tio to the same magnitude Prop 57 Thus as triangle BDE is to triangle ADE so triangle CDE is to trian gle ADE But as triangle BDE is to triangle ADE so is BD to DA For having the same heightnamely the straightline drawn from E perpendicular to AB they are to one another as their bases Prop 61 So for the same reasons as triangle CDE is to ADE so CE is to EA And thus as BD is to DA so CE is to EA Prop 511 And so let the sides AB and AC of triangle ABC have been cut proportionally such that as BD is to DA so CE is to EA And let DE have been joined I say that DE is parallel to BC For by the same construction since as BD is to DA so CE is to EA but as BD is to DA so triangle BDE is to triangle ADE and as CE is to EA so triangle CDE is to triangle ADE Prop 61 thus also as tri angle BDE is to triangle ADE so triangle CDE is to triangle ADE Prop 511 Thus triangles BDE and CDE each have the same ratio to ADE Thus triangle BDE is equal to triangle CDE Prop 59 And they are on the same base DE And equal triangles which are also on the same base are also between the same paral lels Prop 139 Thus DE is parallel to BC Thus if some straightline is drawn parallel to one of the sides of a triangle then it will cut the other sides of the triangle proportionally And if two of the sides of a triangle are cut proportionally then the straightline joining the cutting points will be parallel to the remain ing side of the triangle Which is the very thing it was required to show g Proposition 3 If an angle of a triangle is cut in half and the straight line cutting the angle also cuts the base then the seg ments of the base will have the same ratio as the remain ing sides of the triangle And if the segments of the base have the same ratio as the remaining sides of the trian gle then the straightline joining the vertex to the cutting point will cut the angle of the triangle in half Let ABC be a triangle And let the angle BAC have been cut in half by the straightline AD I say that as BD is to CD so BA is to AC For let CE have been drawn through point C par allel to DA And BA being drawn through let it meet 158STOIQEIWN ELEMENTS BOOK 6 CE at point E B D C A E And since the straightline AC falls across the parallel straightlines AD and EC angle ACE is thus equal to CAD Prop 129 But angle CAD is assumed to be equal to BAD Thus angle BAD is also equal to ACE Again since the straightline BAE falls across the parallel straightlines AD and EC the external angle BAD is equal to the internal angle AEC Prop 129 And angle ACE was also shown to be equal to BAD Thus angle ACE is also equal to AEC And hence side AE is equal to side AC Prop 16 And since AD has been drawn parallel to one of the sides EC of triangle BCE thus proportionally as BD is to DC so BA is to AE Prop 62 And AE is equal to AC Thus as BD is to DC so BA is to AC And so let BD be to DC as BA is to AC And let AD have been joined I say that angle BAC has been cut in half by the straightline AD For by the same construction since as BD is to DC so BA is to AC then also as BD is to DC so BA is to AE For AD has been drawn parallel to one of the sides EC of triangle BCE Prop 62 Thus also as BA is to AC so BA is to AE Prop 511 Thus AC is equal to AE Prop 59 And hence angle AEC is equal to ACE Prop 15 But AEC is equal to the external angle BAD and ACE is equal to the alternate angle CAD Prop 129 Thus angle BAD is also equal to CAD Thus angle BAC has been cut in half by the straightline AD Thus if an angle of a triangle is cut in half and the straightline cutting the angle also cuts the base then the segments of the base will have the same ratio as the re maining sides of the triangle And if the segments of the base have the same ratio as the remaining sides of the triangle then the straightline joining the vertex to the cutting point will cut the angle of the triangle in half Which is the very thing it was required to show The fact that the two straightlines meet follows because the sum of ACE and CAE is less than two rightangles as can easily be demonstrated 159STOIQEIWN ELEMENTS BOOK 6 See Post 5 d Proposition 4 In equiangular triangles the sides about the equal an gles are proportional and those sides subtending equal angles correspond C B E F D A Let ABC and DCE be equiangular triangles having angle ABC equal to DCE and angle BAC to CDE and further angle ACB to CED I say that in trian gles ABC and DCE the sides about the equal angles are proportional and those sides subtending equal angles correspond Let BC be placed straighton to CE And since angles ABC and ACB are less than two rightangles Prop 117 and ACB is equal to DEC thus ABC and DEC are less than two rightangles Thus BA and ED being produced will meet CN 5 Let them have been produced and let them meet at point F And since angle DCE is equal to ABC BF is parallel to CD Prop 128 Again since angle ACB is equal to DEC AC is parallel to FE Prop 128 Thus FACD is a parallelogram Thus FA is equal to DC and AC to FD Prop 134 And since AC has been drawn parallel to one of the sides FE of triangle FBE thus as BA is to AF so BC is to CE Prop 62 And AF is equal to CD Thus as BA is to CD so BC is to CE and alternately as AB is to BC so DC is to CE Prop 516 Again since CD is parallel to BF thus as BC is to CE so FD is to DE Prop 62 And FD is equal to AC Thus as BC is to CE so AC is to DE and alternately as BC is to CA so CE is to ED Prop 62 Therefore since it was shown that as AB is to BC so DC is to CE and as BC is to CA so CE is to ED thus via equality as BA is to AC so CD is to DE Prop 522 Thus in equiangular triangles the sides about the equal angles are proportional and those sides subtend 160STOIQEIWN ELEMENTS BOOK 6 ing equal angles correspond Which is the very thing it was required to show e Proposition 5 If two triangles have proportional sides then the trian gles will be equiangular and will have the angles which corresponding sides subtend equal E B C A D F G Let ABC and DEF be two triangles having propor tional sides so that as AB is to BC so DE is to EF and as BC is to CA so EF is to FD and fur ther as BA is to AC so ED is to DF I say that triangle ABC is equiangular to triangle DEF and that the triangles will have the angles which corresponding sides subtend equal That is angle ABC equal to DEF BCA to EFD and further BAC to EDF For let angle FEG equal to angle ABC and an gle EFG equal to ACB have been constructed on the straightline EF at the points E and F on it respectively Prop 123 Thus the remaining angle at A is equal to the remaining angle at G Prop 132 Thus triangle ABC is equiangular to triangle EGF Thus for triangles ABC and EGF the sides about the equal angles are proportional and those sides subtend ing equal angles correspond Prop 64 Thus as AB is to BC so GE is to EF But as AB is to BC so it was assumed is DE to EF Thus as DE is to EF so GE is to EF Prop 511 Thus DE and GE each have the same ratio to EF Thus DE is equal to GE Prop 59 So for the same reasons DF is also equal to GF Therefore since DE is equal to EG and EF is common the two sides DE EF are equal to the two sides GE EF respectively And base DF is equal to base FG Thus angle DEF is equal to angle GEF Prop 18 and triangle DEF is equal to triangle GEF and the remaining angles are equal to the remaining angles which the equal sides subtend Prop 14 Thus angle DFE is also equal to GFE and 161STOIQEIWN ELEMENTS BOOK 6 angle EDF to EGF And since angle FED is equal to GEF and angle GEF to ABC angle ABC is thus also equal to DEF So for the same reasons angle ACB is also equal to DFE and further the angle at A to the angle at D Thus triangle ABC is equiangular to triangle DEF Thus if two triangles have proportional sides then the triangles will be equiangular and will have the angles which corresponding sides subtend equal Which is the very thing it was required to show Proposition 6 If two triangles have one angle equal to one angle and the sides about the equal angles proportional then the triangles will be equiangular and will have the angles which corresponding sides subtend equal G A B C E F D Let ABC and DEF be two triangles having one angle BAC equal to one angle EDF respectively and the sides about the equal angles proportional so that as BA is to AC so ED is to DF I say that triangle ABC is equiangular to triangle DEF and will have angle ABC equal to DEF and angle ACB to DFE For let angle FDG equal to each of BAC and EDF and angle DFG equal to ACB have been con structed on the straightline AF at the points D and F on it respectively Prop 123 Thus the remaining angle at B is equal to the remaining angle at G Prop 132 Thus triangle ABC is equiangular to triangle DGF Thus proportionally as BA is to AC so GD is to DF Prop 64 And it was also assumed that as BA is to AC so ED is to DF And thus as ED is to DF so GD is to DF Prop 511 Thus ED is equal to DG Prop 59 And DF is common So the two sides ED DF are equal to the two sides GD DF respectively And angle EDF is equal to angle GDF Thus base EF is equal to base GF and triangle DEF is equal to triangle GDF and the remaining angles 162STOIQEIWN ELEMENTS BOOK 6 will be equal to the remaining angles which the equal sides subtend Prop 14 Thus angle DFG is equal to DFE and angle DGF to DEF But angle DFG is equal to ACB Thus angle ACB is also equal to DFE And angle BAC was also assumed to be equal to EDF Thus the remaining angle at B is equal to the remaining angle at E Prop 132 Thus triangle ABC is equiangular to triangle DEF Thus if two triangles have one angle equal to one angle and the sides about the equal angles proportional then the triangles will be equiangular and will have the angles which corresponding sides subtend equal Which is the very thing it was required to show z Proposition 7 If two triangles have one angle equal to one angle and the sides about other angles proportional and the remaining angles either both less than or both not less than rightangles then the triangles will be equiangular and will have the angles about which the sides are pro portional equal D B G C E F A Let ABC and DEF be two triangles having one an gle BAC equal to one angle EDF respectively and the sides about some other angles ABC and DEF re spectively proportional so that as AB is to BC so DE is to EF and the remaining angles at C and F rst of all both less than rightangles I say that triangle ABC is equiangular to triangle DEF and that angle ABC will be equal to DEF and that the remaining angle at C will be manifestly equal to the remaining angle at F For if angle ABC is not equal to angle DEF then one of them is greater Let ABC be greater And let an gle ABG equal to angle DEF have been constructed on the straightline AB at the point B on it Prop 123 And since angle A is equal to angle D and angle ABG to DEF the remaining angle AGB is thus equal 163STOIQEIWN ELEMENTS BOOK 6 to the remaining angle DFE Prop 132 Thus trian gle ABG is equiangular to triangle DEF Thus as AB is to BG so DE is to EF Prop 64 And as DE is to EF so it was assumed is AB to BC Thus AB has the same ratio to each of BC and BG Prop 511 Thus BC is equal to BG Prop 59 And hence the angle at C is equal to angle BGC Prop 15 And the angle at C was assumed to be less than a rightangle Thus angle BGC is also less than a rightangle Hence the adjacent angle to it AGB is greater than a rightangle Prop 113 And AGB was shown to be equal to the angle at F Thus the angle at F is also greater than a rightangle But it was assumed to be less than a right angle The very thing is absurd Thus angle ABC is not unequal to angle DEF Thus it is equal And the angle at A is also equal to the angle at D And thus the remaining angle at C is equal to the remaining an gle at F Prop 132 Thus triangle ABC is equiangular to triangle DEF But again let each of the angles at C and F be assumed to be not less than a rightangle I say again that triangle ABC is equiangular to triangle DEF in this case also For with the same construction we can similarly show that BC is equal to BG Hence also the angle at C is equal to angle BGC And the angle at C is not less than a rightangle Thus BGC is not less than a rightangle either So in triangle BGC the sum of two angles is not less than two rightangles The very thing is impossible Prop 117 Thus again angle ABC is not unequal to DEF Thus it is equal And the an gle at A is also equal to the angle at D Thus the remaining angle at C is equal to the remaining angle at F Prop 132 Thus triangle ABC is equiangular to triangle DEF Thus if two triangles have one angle equal to one angle and the sides about other angles proportional and the remaining angles both less than or both not less than rightangles then the triangles will be equiangular and will have the angles about which the sides are propor tional equal Which is the very thing it was required to show h Proposition 8 If in a rightangled triangle a straightline is drawn from the rightangle perpendicular to the base then the triangles around the perpendicular are similar to the whole triangle and to one another Let ABC be a rightangled triangle having the angle BAC a rightangle and let AD have been drawn from 164STOIQEIWN ELEMENTS BOOK 6 A perpendicular to BC Prop 112 I say that triangles ABD and ADC are each similar to the whole triangle ABC and further to one another B C D A For since angle BAC is equal to ADBfor each are rightanglesand the angle at B is common to the two triangles ABC and ABD the remaining an gle ACB is thus equal to the remaining angle BAD Prop 132 Thus triangle ABC is equiangular to tri angle ABD Thus as BC subtending the rightangle in triangle ABC is to BA subtending the rightangle in tri angle ABD so the same AB subtending the angle at C in triangle ABC is to BD subtending the equal an gle BAD in triangle ABD and further so is AC to AD both subtending the angle at B common to the two triangles Prop 64 Thus triangle ABC is equian gular to triangle ABD and has the sides about the equal angles proportional Thus triangle ABC is similar to triangle ABD Def 61 So similarly we can show that triangle ABC is also similar to triangle ADC Thus tri angles ABD and ADC are each similar to the whole triangle ABC So I say that triangles ABD and ADC are also similar to one another For since the rightangle BDA is equal to the right angle ADC and indeed angle BAD was also shown to be equal to the angle at C thus the remaining an gle at B is also equal to the remaining angle DAC Prop 132 Thus triangle ABD is equiangular to trian gle ADC Thus as BD subtending angle BAD in tri angle ABD is to DA subtending the angle at C in tri angle ADC which is equal to angle BAD so is the same AD subtending the angle at B in triangle ABD to DC subtending angle DAC in triangle ADC which is equal to the angle at B and further so is BA to AC each subtending rightangles Prop 64 Thus triangle ABD is similar to triangle ADC Def 61 Thus if in a rightangled triangle a straightline is drawn from the rightangle perpendicular to the base 165STOIQEIWN ELEMENTS BOOK 6 then the triangles around the perpendicular are similar to the whole triangle and to one another Which is the very thing it was required to show Pri sma Corollary So it is clear from this that if in a rightangled tri angle a straightline is drawn from the rightangle per pendicular to the base then the straightline so drawn is in mean proportion to the pieces of the base Which is the very thing it was required to show In other words the perpendicular is the geometric mean of the pieces j Proposition 9 To cut off a prescribed part from a given straightline C A F E D B Let AB be the given straightline So it is required to cut off a prescribed part from AB So let a third part have been prescribed And let some straightline AC have been drawn from point A encompassing a random angle with AB And let a ran dom point D have been taken on AC And let DE and EC be made equal to AD Prop 13 And let BC have been joined And let DF have been drawn through D parallel to it Prop 131 Therefore since FD has been drawn parallel to one of the sides BC of triangle ABC then proportionally as CD is to DA so BF is to FA Prop 62 And CD is double DA Thus BF is also double FA Thus BA is triple AF Thus the prescribed third part AF has been cut off from the given straightline AB Which is the very thing it was required to do i Proposition 10 To cut a given uncut straightline similarly to a given cut straightline 166STOIQEIWN ELEMENTS BOOK 6 H A E C K G F B D Let AB be the given uncut straightline and AC a straightline cut at points D and E and let AC be laid down so as to encompass a random angle with AB And let CB have been joined And let DF and EG have been drawn through points D and E respectively parallel to BC and let DHK have been drawn through point D parallel to AB Prop 131 Thus FH and HB are each parallelograms Thus DH is equal to FG and HK to GB Prop 134 And since the straightline HE has been drawn parallel to one of the sides KC of triangle DKC thus proportionally as CE is to ED so KH is to HD Prop 62 And KH is equal to BG and HD to GF Thus as CE is to ED so BG is to GF Again since FD has been drawn parallel to one of the sides GE of triangle AGE thus proportionally as ED is to DA so GF is to FA Prop 62 And it was also shown that as CE is to ED so BG is to GF Thus as CE is to ED so BG is to GF and as ED is to DA so GF is to FA Thus the given uncut straightline AB has been cut similarly to the given cut straightline AC Which is the very thing it was required to do ia Proposition 11 To nd a third straightline proportional to two given straightlines Let BA and AC be the two given straightlines and let them be laid down encompassing a random angle So it is required to nd a third straightline proportional to BA and AC For let BA and AC have been produced to points D and E respectively and let BD be made equal to AC Prop 13 And let BC have been joined And let DE have been drawn through point D parallel to it Prop 131 Therefore since BC has been drawn parallel to one of the sides DE of triangle ADE proportionally as AB is to BD so AC is to CE Prop 62 And BD is equal 167STOIQEIWN ELEMENTS BOOK 6 to AC Thus as AB is to AC so AC is to CE C B E D A Thus a third straightline CE has been found which is proportional to the two given straightlines AB and AC Which is the very thing it was required to do ib Proposition 12 To nd a fourth straightline proportional to three given straightlines D A C B E G H F Let A B and C be the three given straightlines So it is required to nd a fourth straightline proportional to A B and C Let the two straightlines DE and DF be set out en compassing the random angle EDF And let DG be made equal to A and GE to B and further DH to C Prop 13 And GH being joined let EF have been drawn through point E parallel to it Prop 131 Therefore since GH has been drawn parallel to one of the sides EF of triangle DEF thus as DG is to GE so DH is to HF Prop 62 And DG is equal to A and GE to B and DH to C Thus as A is to B so C is 168STOIQEIWN ELEMENTS BOOK 6 to HF Thus a fourth straightline HF has been found which is proportional to the three given straightlines A B and C Which is the very thing it was required to do ig Proposition 13 To nd the straightline in mean proportion to two given straightlines C A B D Let AB and BC be the two given straightlines So it is required to nd the straightline in mean proportion to AB and BC Let AB and BC be laid down straighton with re spect to one another and let the semicircle ADC have been drawn on AC Prop 110 And let BD have been drawn from point B at rightangles to AC Prop 111 And let AD and DC have been joined And since ADC is an angle in a semicircle it is a rightangle Prop 331 And since in the rightangled triangle ADC the straightline DB has been drawn from the rightangle perpendicular to the base DB is thus the mean proportional to the pieces of the base AB and BC Prop 68 corr Thus DB has been found which is in mean propor tion to the two given straightlines AB and BC Which is the very thing it was required to do In other words to nd the geometric mean of two given straightlines id Proposition 14 In equal and equiangular parallelograms the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional And those equiangular parallelograms in which the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional are equal Let AB and BC be equal and equiangular parallelo grams having the angles at B equal And let DB and BE be laid down straighton with respect to one another Thus FB and BG are also straighton with respect to one another Prop 114 I say that the sides of AB and 169STOIQEIWN ELEMENTS BOOK 6 BC about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional that is to say that as DB is to BE so GB is to BF D A F B G E C For let the parallelogram FE have been completed Therefore since parallelogram AB is equal to parallelo gram BC and FE is some other parallelogram thus as parallelogram AB is to FE so parallelogram BC is to FE Prop 57 But as parallelogram AB is to FE so DB is to BE and as parallelogram BC is to FE so GB is to BF Prop 61 Thus also as DB is to BE so GB is to BF Thus in parallelograms AB and BC the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional And so let DB be to BE as GB is to BF I say that parallelogram AB is equal to parallelogram BC For since as DB is to BE so GB is to BF but as DB is to BE so parallelogram AB is to parallelo gram FE and as GB is to BF so parallelogram BC is to parallelogram FE Prop 61 thus also as par allelogram AB is to FE so parallelogram BC is to FE Prop 511 Thus parallelogram AB is equal to parallelogram BC Prop 59 Thus in equal and equiangular parallelograms the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally propor tional And those equiangular parallelograms in which the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally propor tional are equal Which is the very thing it was required to show ie Proposition 15 In equal triangles also having one angle equal to one angle the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional And those triangles having one angle equal to one angle for which the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional are equal Let ABC and ADE be equal triangles having one an gle equal to one angle namely BAC equal to DAE I say that in triangles ABC and ADE the sides about the 170STOIQEIWN ELEMENTS BOOK 6 equal angles are reciprocally proportional that is to say that as CA is to AD so EA is to AB A E C D B For let CA be laid down so as to be straighton with respect to AD Thus EA is also straighton with re spect to AB Prop 114 And let BD have been joined Therefore since triangle ABC is equal to triangle ADE and BAD is some other triangle thus as tri angle CAB is to triangle BAD so triangle EAD is to triangle BAD Prop 57 But as triangle CAB is to BAD so CA is to AD and as triangle EAD is to BAD so EA is to AB Prop 61 And thus as CA is to AD so EA is to AB Thus in triangles ABC and ADE the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional And so let the sides of triangles ABC and ADE be reciprocally proportional and thus let CA be to AD as EA is to AB I say that triangle ABC is equal to triangle ADE For BD again being joined since as CA is to AD so EA is to AB but as CA is to AD so triangle ABC is to triangle BAD and as EA is to AB so triangle EAD is to triangle BAD Prop 61 thus as triangle ABC is to triangle BAD so triangle EAD is to tri angle BAD Thus triangles ABC and EAD each have the same ratio to BAD Thus triangle ABC is equal to triangle EAD Prop 59 Thus in equal triangles also having one angle equal to one angle the sides about the equal angles are recip rocally proportional And those triangles having one an gle equal to one angle for which the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional are equal Which is the very thing it was required to show i Proposition 16 If four straightlines are proportional then the rect angle contained by the two outermost is equal to the rectangle contained by the middle two And if the rect 171STOIQEIWN ELEMENTS BOOK 6 angle contained by the two outermost is equal to the rectangle contained by the middle two then the four straightlines will be proportional D B G A E F C H Let AB CD E and F be four proportional straight lines such that as AB is to CD so E is to F I say that the rectangle contained by AB and F is equal to the rectangle contained by CD and E For let AG and CH have been drawn from points A and C at rightangles to the straightlines AB and CD respectively Prop 111 And let AG be made equal to F and CH to E Prop 13 And let the parallelograms BG and DH have been completed And since as AB is to CD so E is to F and E is equal CH and F to AG thus as AB is to CD so CH is to AG Thus in the parallelograms BG and DH the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally propor tional And those equiangular parallelograms in which the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally propor tional are equal Prop 614 Thus parallelogram BG is equal to parallelogram DH And BG is the rectangle contained by AB and F For AG is equal to F And DH is the rectangle contained by CD and E For E is equal to CH Thus the rectangle contained by AB and F is equal to the rectangle contained by CD and E And so let the rectangle contained by AB and F be equal to the rectangle contained by CD and E I say that the four straightlines will be proportional so that as AB is to CD so E is to F For with the same construction since the rectangle contained by AB and F is equal to the rectangle con tained by CD and E And BG is the rectangle con tained by AB and F For AG is equal to F And DH is the rectangle contained by CD and E For CH is equal to E BG is thus equal to DH And they are equiangular And in equal and equiangular parallel ograms the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional Prop 614 Thus as AB is to CD so CH is to AG And CH is equal to E and AG to F Thus as AB is to CD so E is to F Thus if four straightlines are proportional then the rectangle contained by the two outermost is equal to the rectangle contained by the middle two And if the rectangle contained by the two outermost is equal to 172STOIQEIWN ELEMENTS BOOK 6 the rectangle contained by the middle two then the four straightlines will be proportional Which is the very thing it was required to show iz Proposition 17 If three straightlines are proportional then the rect angle contained by the two outermost is equal to the square on the middle one And if the rectangle con tained by the two outermost is equal to the square on the middle one then the three straightlines will be pro portional D A B C Let A B and C be three proportional straightlines such that as A is to B so B is to C I say that the rectangle contained by A and C is equal to the square on B Let D be made equal to B Prop 13 And since as A is to B so B is to C and B is equal to D thus as A is to B so D is to C And if four straightlines are proportional then the rectangle contained by the two outermost is equal to the rectan gle contained by the middle two Prop 616 Thus the rectangle contained by A and C is equal to the rectangle contained by B and D But the rectangle contained by B and D is the square on B For B is equal to D Thus the rectangle contained by A and C is equal to the square on B And so let the rectangle contained by A and C be equal to the square on B I say that as A is to B so B is to C For with the same construction since the rectangle contained by A and C is equal to the square on B But the square on B is the rectangle contained by B and D For B is equal to D The rectangle contained by A and C is thus equal to the rectangle contained by B and D And if the rectangle contained by the two outermost is equal to the rectangle contained by the middle two then the four straightlines are proportional Prop 616 Thus as A is to B so D is to C And B is equal to D Thus as A is to B so B is to C Thus if three straightlines are proportional then the rectangle contained by the two outermost is equal to the square on the middle one And if the rectangle con tained by the two outermost is equal to the square on the middle one then the three straightlines will be pro portional Which is the very thing it was required to 173STOIQEIWN ELEMENTS BOOK 6 show ih Proposition 18 To describe a rectilinear gure similar and simi larly laid down to a given rectilinear gure on a given straightline G C E D H A B F Let AB be the given straightline and CE the given rectilinear gure So it is required to describe a rectilinear gure similar and similarly laid down to the rectilinear gure CE on the straightline AB Let DF have been joined and let GAB equal to the angle at C and ABG equal to angle CDF have been constructed on the straightline AB at the points A and B on it respectively Prop 123 Thus the remain ing angle CFD is equal to AGB Prop 132 Thus triangle FCD is equiangular to triangle GAB Thus proportionally as FD is to GB so FC is to GA and CD to AB Prop 64 Again let BGH equal to an gle DFE and GBH equal to angle FDE have been constructed on the straightline BG at the points G and B on it respectively Prop 123 Thus the remain ing angle at E is equal to the remaining angle at H Prop 132 Thus triangle FDE is equiangular to tri angle GHB Thus proportionally as FD is to GB so FE is to GH and ED to HB Prop 64 And it was also shown that as FD is to GB so FC is to GA and CD to AB Thus also as FC is to AG so CD is to AB and FE to GH and further ED to HB And since angle CFD is equal to AGB and DFE to BGH thus the whole angle CFE is equal to the whole an gle AGH So for the same reasons angle CDE is also equal to ABH And the angle at C is also equal to the angle at A and the angle at E to the angle at H Thus gure AH is equiangular to CE And the two gures have the sides about their equal angles pro portional Thus the rectilinear gure AH is similar to the rectilinear gure CE Def 61 Thus the rectilinear gure AH similar and similarly laid down to the given rectilinear gure CE has been constructed on the given straightline AB Which is the 174STOIQEIWN ELEMENTS BOOK 6 very thing it was required to do ij Proposition 19 Similar triangles are to one another in the squared ratio of their corresponding sides E G C A D F B Let ABC and DEF be similar triangles having the angle at B equal to the angle at E and AB to BC as DE is to EF such that BC corresponds to EF I say that triangle ABC has a squared ratio to triangle DEF with respect to that side BC has to EF For let a third straightline BG have been taken which is proportional to BC and EF so that as BC is to EF so EF is to BG Prop 611 And let AG have been joined Therefore since as AB is to BC so DE is to EF thus alternately as AB is to DE so BC is to EF Prop 516 But as BC is to EF so EF is to BG And thus as AB is to DE so EF is to BG Thus for triangles ABG and DEF the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional And those triangles having one angle equal to one angle for which the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional are equal Prop 615 Thus triangle ABG is equal to triangle DEF And since as BC is to EF so EF is to BG and if three straightlines are proportional then the rst has a squared ratio to the third with respect to the second Def 59 BC thus has a squared ratio to BG with respect to that CB has to EF And as CB is to BG so triangle ABC is to triangle ABG Prop 61 Thus triangle ABC also has a squared ratio to triangle ABG with respect to that side BC has to EF And triangle ABG is equal to triangle DEF Thus trian gle ABC also has a squared ratio to triangle DEF with respect to that side BC has to EF Thus similar triangles are to one another in the squared ratio of their corresponding sides Which is the very thing it was required to show Pri sma Corollary So it is clear from this that if three straightlines are proportional then as the rst is to the third so the gure 175STOIQEIWN ELEMENTS BOOK 6 described on the rst is to the similar and similarly described gure on the second Which is the very thing it was required to show Literally double k Proposition 20 Similar polygons can be divided into equal numbers of similar triangles corresponding in proportion to the wholes and one polygon has to the other polygon a squared ratio with respect to that a corresponding side has to a corresponding side L B A M E C F N H D K G Let ABCDE and FGHKL be similar polygons and let AB correspond to FG I say that polygons ABCDE and FGHKL can be divided into equal numbers of simi lar triangles corresponding in proportion to the wholes and that polygon ABCDE has a squared ratio to poly gon FGHKL with respect to that AB has to FG Let BE EC GL and LH have been joined And since polygon ABCDE is similar to polygon FGHKL angle BAE is equal to angle GFL and as BA is to AE so GF is to FL Def 61 Therefore since ABE and FGL are two triangles having one angle equal to one angle and the sides about the equal angles propor tional triangle ABE is thus equiangular to triangle FGL Prop 66 Hence they are also similar Prop 64 Def 61 Thus angle ABE is equal to angle FGL And the whole angle ABC is equal to the whole angle FGH on account of the similarity of the polygons Thus the remaining angle EBC is equal to LGH And since on account of the similarity of triangles ABE and FGL as EB is to BA so LG is to GF but also on account of the similarity of the polygons as AB is to BC so FG is to GH thus via equality as EB is to BC so LG is to GH Prop 522 and the sides about the equal angles EBC and LGH are proportional Thus triangle EBC is equiangular to triangle LGH Prop 66 Hence triangle EBC is also similar to triangle LGH Prop 64 Def 61 So for the same reasons triangle ECD is also similar 176STOIQEIWN ELEMENTS BOOK 6 to triangle LHK Thus the similar polygons ABCDE and FGHKL have been divided into equal numbers of similar triangles I also say that the triangles correspond in propor tion to the wholes That is to say the triangles are proportional ABE EBC and ECD are the leading magnitudes and their associated following magni tudes are FGL LGH and LHK respectively I also say that polygon ABCDE has a squared ratio to poly gon FGHKL with respect to that a corresponding side has to a corresponding sidethat is to say side AB to FG For let AC and FH have been joined And since angle ABC is equal to FGH and as AB is to BC so FG is to GH on account of the similarity of the polygons triangle ABC is equiangular to triangle FGH Prop 66 Thus angle BAC is equal to GFH and angle BCA to GHF And since angle BAM is equal to GFN and angle ABM is also equal to FGN see earlier the remaining angle AMB is thus also equal to the remaining angle FNG Prop 132 Thus triangle ABM is equiangular to triangle FGN So similarly we can show that triangle BMC is also equiangular to triangle GNH Thus pro portionally as AM is to MB so FN is to NG and as BM is to MC so GN is to NH Prop 64 Hence also via equality as AM is to MC so FN is to NH Prop 522 But as AM is to MC so triangle ABM is to MBC and AME to EMC For they are to one an other as their bases Prop 61 And as one of the leading magnitudes is to one of the following magnitudes so the sum of all the leading magnitudes is to the sum of all the following magnitudes Prop 512 Thus as triangle AMB is to BMC so triangle ABE is to CBE But as triangle AMB is to BMC so AM is to MC Thus also as AM is to MC so triangle ABE is to triangle EBC And so for the same reasons as FN is to NH so triangle FGL is to triangle GLH And as AM is to MC so FN is to NH Thus also as triangle ABE is to triangle BEC so triangle FGL is to triangle GLH and alternately as triangle ABE is to triangle FGL so triangle BEC is to triangle GLH Prop 516 So similarly we can also show by joining BD and GK that as triangle BEC is to triangle LGH so triangle ECD is to triangle LHK And since as tri angle ABE is to triangle FGL so triangle EBC is to LGH and further triangle ECD to LHK and also as one of the leading magnitudes is to one of the fol lowing so the sum of all the leading magnitudes is to the sum of all the following Prop 512 thus as trian gle ABE is to triangle FGL so polygon ABCDE is to polygon FGHKL But triangle ABE has a squared ratio 177STOIQEIWN ELEMENTS BOOK 6 to triangle FGL with respect to that the corresponding side AB has to the corresponding side FG For similar triangles are in the squared ratio of corresponding sides Prop 614 Thus polygon ABCDE also has a squared ratio to polygon FGHKL with respect to that the cor responding side AB has to the corresponding side FG Thus similar polygons can be divided into equal num bers of similar triangles corresponding in proportion to the wholes and one polygon has to the other polygon a squared ratio with respect to that a corresponding side has to a corresponding side Which is the very thing it was required to show Pri sma Corollary And in the same manner it can also be shown for similar quadrilaterals that they are in the squared ratio of their corresponding sides And it was also shown for triangles Hence in general similar rectilinear gures are also to one another in the squared ratio of their corre sponding sides Which is the very thing it was required to show ka Proposition 21 Rectilinear gures similar to the same rectilinear g ure are also similar to one another A B C Let each of the rectilinear gures A and B be similar to the rectilinear gure C I say that A is also similar to B For since A is similar to C A is equiangular to C and has the sides about the equal angles proportional Def 61 Again since B is similar to C B is equian gular to C and has the sides about the equal angles proportional Def 61 Thus A and B are each equian gular to C and have the sides about the equal angles 178STOIQEIWN ELEMENTS BOOK 6 proportional hence A is also equiangular to B and has the sides about the equal angles proportional Thus A is similar to B Def 61 Which is the very thing it was required to show kb Proposition 22 If four straightlines are proportional then similar and similarly described rectilinear gures drawn on them will also be proportional And if similar and similarly described rectilinear gures drawn on them are pro portional then the straightlines themselves will also be proportional H A B C D E G K L M N Q R O P S F Let AB CD EF and GH be four proportional straightlines such that as AB is to CD so EF is to GH And let the similar and similarly laid out rec tilinear gures KAB and LCD have been described on AB and CD respectively and the similar and similarly laid out rectilinear gures MF and NH on EF and GH respectively I say that as KAB is to LCD so MF is to NH For let a third straightline O have been taken which is proportional to AB and CD and a third straightline P proportional to EF and GH Prop 611 And since as AB is to CD so EF is to GH and as CD is to O so GH is to P thus via equality as AB is to O so EF is to P Prop 522 But as AB is to O so also KAB is to LCD and as EF is to P so MF is to NH Prop 519 corr And thus as KAB is to LCD so MF is to NH And so let KAB be to LCD as MF is to NH I say also that as AB is to CD so EF is to GH For if as AB is to CD so EF is not to GH let AB be to CD as EF 179STOIQEIWN ELEMENTS BOOK 6 is to QR Prop 612 And let the rectilinear gure SR similar and similarly laid down to either of MF or NH have been described on QR Props 618 621 Therefore since as AB is to CD so EF is to QR and the similar and similarly laid out rectilinear g ures KAB and LCD have been described on AB and CD respectively and the similar and similarly laid out rectilinear gures MF and SR on EF and QR re sespectively thus as KAB is to LCD so MF is to SR see above And it was also assumed that as KAB is to LCD so MF is to NH Thus also as MF is to SR so MF is to NH Prop 511 Thus MF has the same ratio to each of NH and SR Thus NH is equal to SR Prop 59 And it is also similar and similarly laid out to it Thus GH is equal to QR And since AB is to CD as EF is to QR and QR is equal to GH thus as AB is to CD so EF is to GH Thus if four straightlines are proportional then sim ilar and similarly described rectilinear gures drawn on them will also be proportional And if similar and similarly described rectilinear gures drawn on them are proportional then the straightlines themselves will also be proportional Which is the very thing it was required to show Here Euclid assumes without proof that if two similar gures are equal then any pair of corresponding sides is also equal kg Proposition 23 Equiangular parallelograms have to one another the ratio compounded out of the ratios of their sides Let AC and CF be equiangular parallelograms having angle BCD equal to ECG I say that parallelogram AC has to parallelogram CF the ratio compounded out of the ratios of their sides For let BC be laid down so as to be straighton to CG Thus DC is also straighton to CE Prop 114 And let the parallelogram DG have been completed And let some straightline K have been laid down And let it be contrived that as BC is to CG so K is to L and as DC is to CE so L is to M Prop 612 Thus the ratios of K to L and of L to M are the same as the ratios of the sides namely BC to CG and DC to CE respectively But the ratio of K to M is com pounded out of the ratio of K to L and the ratio of L to M Hence K also has to M the ratio compounded out of the ratios of the sides of the parallelograms And since as BC is to CG so parallelogram AC is to CH Prop 61 but as BC is to CG so K is to L thus also as K is to L so parallelogram AC is to CH Again since as DC is to CE so parallelogram 180STOIQEIWN ELEMENTS BOOK 6 CH is to CF Prop 61 but as DC is to CE so L is to M thus also as L is to M so parallelogram CH is to parallelogram CF Therefore since it was shown that as K is to L so parallelogram AC is to parallelogram CH and as L is to M so parallelogram CH is to parallelogram CF thus via equality as K is to M so parallelogram AC is to parallelogram CF Prop 522 And K has to M the ratio compounded out of the ratios of the sides of the parallelograms Thus parallelogram AC also has to parallelogram CF the ratio compounded out of the ratio of their sides F A B K L M C G E D H Thus equiangular parallelograms have to one another the ratio compounded out of the ratio of their sides Which is the very thing it was required to show In modern terminology if two ratios are compounded then they are multiplied together kd Proposition 24 In any parallelogram the parallelograms about the di agonal are similar to the whole and to one another Let ABCD be a parallelogram and AC its diagonal And let EG and HK be parallelograms about AC I say that the parallelograms EG and HK are each similar to the whole parallelogram ABCD and to one another For since EF has been drawn parallel to one of the sides BC of triangle ABC proportionally as BE is to EA so CF is to FA Prop 62 Again since FG has been drawn parallel to one of the sides CD of trian gle ACD proportionally as CF is to FA so DG is to GA Prop 62 But as CF is to FA so it was also shown is BE to EA And thus as BE is to EA so DG is to GA And thus compounding as BA is to AE so DA is to AG Prop 518 And alternately as BA is to AD so EA is to AG Prop 516 Thus in parallelograms ABCD and EG the sides about the common angle BAD are proportional And since GF is parallel to DC angle AFG is equal to DCA Prop 129 181STOIQEIWN ELEMENTS BOOK 6 And angle DAC is common to the two triangles ADC and AGF Thus triangle ADC is equiangular to triangle AGF Prop 132 So for the same reasons triangle ACB is equiangular to triangle AFE and the whole par allelogram ABCD is equiangular to parallelogram EG Thus proportionally as AD is to DC so AG is to GF and as DC is to CA so GF is to FA and as AC is to CB so AF is to FE and further as CB is to BA so FE is to EA Prop 64 And since it was shown that as DC is to CA so GF is to FA and as AC is to CB so AF is to FE thus via equality as DC is to CB so GF is to FE Prop 522 Thus in parallelograms ABCD and EG the sides about the equal angles are proportional Thus parallelogram ABCD is similar to parallelogram EG Def 61 So for the same reasons parallelogram ABCD is also similar to par allelogram KH Thus parallelograms EG and HK are each similar to parallelogram ABCD And rectilin ear gures similar to the same rectilinear gure are also similar to one another Prop 621 Thus parallelogram EG is also similar to parallelogram HK E A B G F H D K C Thus in any parallelogram the parallelograms about the diagonal are similar to the whole and to one another Which is the very thing it was required to show ke Proposition 25 To construct a single rectilinear gure similar to a given rectilinear gure and equal to a different given rec tilinear gure 182STOIQEIWN ELEMENTS BOOK 6 F A B C K G H E D L M Let ABC be the given rectilinear gure to which it is required to construct a similar rectilinear gure and D the rectilinear gure to which the constructed gure is required to be equal So it is required to construct a single rectilinear gure similar to ABC and equal to D For let the parallelogram BE equal to triangle ABC have been applied to the straightline BC Prop 144 and the parallelogram CM equal to D have been ap plied to the straightline CE in the angle FCE which is equal to CBL Prop 145 Thus BC is straighton to CF and LE to EM Prop 114 And let the mean pro portion GH have been taken of BC and CF Prop 613 And let KGH similar and similarly laid out to ABC have been described on GH Prop 618 And since as BC is to GH so GH is to CF and if three straightlines are proportional then as the rst is to the third so the gure described on the rst is to the similar and similarly described gure on the second Prop 619 corr thus as BC is to CF so triangle ABC is to triangle KGH But also as BC is to CF so parallelogram BE is to parallelogram EF Prop 61 And thus as triangle ABC is to triangle KGH so par allelogram BE is to parallelogram EF Thus alter nately as triangle ABC is to parallelogram BE so tri angle KGH is to parallelogram EF Prop 516 And triangle ABC is equal to parallelogram BE Thus tri angle KGH is also equal to parallelogram EF But parallelogram EF is equal to D Thus KGH is also equal to D And KGH is also similar to ABC Thus a single rectilinear gure KGH has been con structed which is similar to the given rectilinear gure ABC and equal to a different given rectilinear gure D Which is the very thing it was required to do k Proposition 26 If from a parallelogram another parallelogram is subtracted which is similar and similarly laid out to the whole having a common angle with it then the sub tracted parallelogram is about the same diagonal as the whole For from parallelogram ABCD let parallelogram 183STOIQEIWN ELEMENTS BOOK 6 AF have been subtracted which is similar and similarly laid out to ABCD having the common angle DAB with it I say that ABCD is about the same diagonal as AF K A G D B H F C E For if not then if possible let AHC be ABCDs diagonal And producing GF let it have been drawn through to point H And let HK have been drawn through point H parallel to either of AD or BC Prop 131 Therefore since ABCD is about the same diagonal as KG thus as DA is to AB so GA is to AK Prop 624 And on account of the similarity of ABCD and EG also as DA is to AB so GA is to AE Thus also as GA is to AK so GA is to AE Thus GA has the same ratio to each of AK and AE Thus AE is equal to AK Prop 59 the lesser to the greater The very thing is impossible Thus ABCD is not not about the same di agonal as AF Thus parallelogram ABCD is about the same diagonal as parallelogram AF Thus if from a parallelogram another parallelogram is subtracted which is similar and similarly laid out to the whole having a common angle with it then the subtracted parallelogram is about the same diagonal as the whole Which is the very thing it was required to show kz Proposition 27 Of all the parallelograms applied to the same straight line and falling short by parallelogrammic gures similar and similarly laid out to the parallelogram described on half the straightline the greatest is the parallelo gram applied to half the straightline which is similar to that parallelogram by which it falls short Let AB be a straightline and let it have been cut in half at point C Prop 110 And let the parallelogram AD have been applied to the straightline AB falling short by the parallelogrammic gure DB which is ap plied to half of ABthat is to say CB I say that of all the parallelograms applied to AB and falling short by 184STOIQEIWN ELEMENTS BOOK 6 parallelogrammic gures similar and similarly laid out to DB the greatest is AD For let the parallelogram AF have been applied to the straightline AB falling short by the parallelogrammic gure FB which is similar and similarly laid out to DB I say that AD is greater than AF F A C K G D L N M B H E For since parallelogram DB is similar to parallelo gram FB they are about the same diagonal Prop 626 Let their common diagonal DB have been drawn and let the rest of the gure have been described Therefore since complement CF is equal to com plement FE Prop 143 and parallelogram FB is common the whole parallelogram CH is thus equal to the whole parallelogram KE But parallelogram CH is equal to CG since AC is also equal to CB Prop 61 Thus parallelogram GC is also equal to EK Let parallelogram CF have been added to both Thus the whole parallelogram AF is equal to the gnomon LMN Hence parallelogram DBthat is to say ADis greater than parallelogram AF Thus for all parallelograms applied to the same straightline and falling short by a parallelogrammic gure similar and similarly laid out to the parallelo gram described on half the straightline the greatest is the parallelogram applied to half the straightline Which is the very thing it was required to show kh Proposition 28 To apply a parallelogram equal to a given rectilin ear gure to a given straightline the applied parallel ogram falling short by a parallelogrammic gure similar to a given parallelogram It is necessary for the given rectilinear gure to which it is required to apply an equal parallelogram not to be greater than the parallelo gram described on half of the straightline and similar to the decit Let AB be the given straightline and C the given rectilinear gure to which the parallelogram applied to 185STOIQEIWN ELEMENTS BOOK 6 AB is required to be equal being not greater than the parallelogram described on half of AB and similar to the decit and D the parallelogram to which the decit is required to be similar So it is required to apply a parallelogram equal to the given rectilinear gure C to the straightline AB falling short by a parallelogrammic gure which is similar to D P G A S B R D T J O E H Z X L K N M Q U F W A B E F G H K Q P R S T U V D N M L C O Let AB have been cut in half at point E Prop 110 and let parallelogram EBFG which is similar and similarly laid out to parallelogram D have been de scribed on EB Prop 618 And let parallelogram AG have been completed Therefore if AG is equal to C then the thing pre scribed has happened For a parallelogram AG equal to the given rectilinear gure C has been applied to the given straightline AB falling short by a parallelogram mic gure GB which is similar to D And if not let HE be greater than C And HE is equal to GB Prop 61 Thus GB is also greater than C So let parallelo gram KLMN have been constructed so as to be both similar and similarly laid out to D and equal to the ex cess by which GB is greater than C Prop 625 But GB is similar to D Thus KM is also similar to GB Prop 621 Therefore let KL correspond to GE and LM to GF And since parallelogram GB is equal to gure C and parallelogram KM GB is thus greater than KM Thus GE is also greater than KL and GF than LM Let GO be made equal to KL and GP to LM Prop 13 And let the parallelogram OGPQ have been completed Thus GQ is equal and similar to KM but KM is similar to GB Thus GQ is also similar to GB Prop 621 Thus GQ and GB are about the same diag onal Prop 626 Let GQB be their common diagonal and let the remainder of the gure have been described Therefore since BG is equal to C and KM of which GQ is equal to KM the remaining gnomon UWV is thus equal to the remainder C And since the complement PR is equal to the complement OS Prop 143 let parallelogram QB have been added to both Thus the whole parallelogram PB is equal to the whole par 186STOIQEIWN ELEMENTS BOOK 6 allelogram OB But OB is equal to T E since side AE is equal to side EB Prop 61 Thus T E is also equal to PB Let parallelogram OS have been added to both Thus the whole parallelogram T S is equal to the gnomon V WU But gnomon V WU was shown to be equal to C Therefore parallelogram T S is also equal to gure C Thus the parallelogram ST equal to the given rec tilinear gure C has been applied to the given straight line AB falling short by the parallelogrammic gure QB which is similar to D inasmuch as QB is similar to GQ Prop 624 Which is the very thing it was required to do This proposition is a geometric solution of the quadratic equation x2 x 0 Here x is the ratio of a side of the decit to the corresponding side of gure D is the ratio of the length of AB to the length of that side of gure D which corresponds to the side of the decit running along AB and is the ratio of the areas of gures C and D The constraint corresponds to the condition 24 for the equation to have real roots Only the smaller root of the equation is found The larger root can be found by a similar method kj Proposition 29 To apply a parallelogram equal to a given rectilin ear gure to a given straightline the applied parallelo gram overshooting by a parallelogrammic gure similar to a given parallelogram F G J L M O B A N P E Z H K Q D X Y W B C F H K M L P D G N E O Q A V X Let AB be the given straightline and C the given rectilinear gure to which the parallelogram applied to AB is required to be equal and D the parallelogram to which the excess is required to be similar So it is required to apply a parallelogram equal to the given rec tilinear gure C to the given straightline AB overshoot ing by a parallelogrammic gure similar to D Let AB have been cut in half at point E Prop 110 and let the parallelogram BF which is similar and similarly laid out to D have been described on EB Prop 618 And let parallelogram GH have been con structed so as to be both similar and similarly laid out to D and equal to the sum of BF and C Prop 625 And let KH correspond to FL and KG to FE And since parallelogram GH is greater than parallelogram FB 187STOIQEIWN ELEMENTS BOOK 6 KH is thus also greater than FL and KG than FE Let FL and FE have been produced and let FLM be made equal to KH and FEN to KG Prop 13 And let parallelogram MN have been completed Thus MN is equal and similar to GH But GH is similar to EL Thus MN is also similar to EL Prop 621 EL is thus about the same diagonal as MN Prop 626 Let their common diagonal FO have been drawn and let the remainder of the gure have been described And since parallelogram GH is equal to parallel ogram EL and gure C but GH is equal to paral lelogram MN MN is thus also equal to EL and C Let EL have been subtracted from both Thus the re maining gnomon XWV is equal to gure C And since AE is equal to EB parallelogram AN is also equal to parallelogram NB Prop 61 that is to say parallel ogram LP Prop 143 Let parallelogram EO have been added to both Thus the whole parallelogram AO is equal to the gnomon V WX But the gnomon V WX is equal to gure C Thus parallelogram AO is also equal to gure C Thus the parallelogram AO equal to the given rec tilinear gure C has been applied to the given straight line AB overshooting by the parallelogrammic gure QP which is similar to D since PQ is also similar to EL Prop 624 Which is the very thing it was required to do This proposition is a geometric solution of the quadratic equation x2 x 0 Here x is the ratio of a side of the excess to the corresponding side of gure D is the ratio of the length of AB to the length of that side of gure D which corresponds to the side of the excess running along AB and is the ratio of the areas of gures C and D Only the positive root of the equation is found l Proposition 30 To cut a given nite straightline in extreme and mean ratio E F H B C A D Let AB be the given nite straightline So it is re quired to cut the straightline AB in extreme and mean 188STOIQEIWN ELEMENTS BOOK 6 ratio Let the square BC have been described on AB Prop 146 and let the parallelogram CD equal to BC have been applied to AC overshooting by the gure AD which is similar to BC Prop 629 And BC is a square Thus AD is also a square And since BC is equal to CD let rectangle CE have been subtracted from both Thus the remaining rect angle BF is equal to the remaining square AD And it is also equiangular to it Thus the sides of BF and AD about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional Prop 614 Thus as FE is to ED so AE is to EB And FE is equal to AB and ED to AE Thus as BA is to AE so AE is to EB And AB is greater than AE Thus AE is also greater than EB Prop 514 Thus the straightline AB has been cut in extreme and mean ratio at E and AE is its greater piece Which is the very thing it was required to do This method of cutting a straightline is sometimes called the Golden Sectionsee Prop 211 la Proposition 31 In rightangled triangles the gure drawn on the side subtending the rightangle is equal to the sum of the similar and similarly described gures on the sides surrounding the rightangle D A C B Let ABC be a rightangled triangle having the angle BAC a rightangle I say that the gure drawn on BC is equal to the sum of the similar and similarly described gures on BA and AC Let the perpendicular AD have been drawn Prop 112 Therefore since in the rightangled triangle ABC the straightline AD has been drawn from the right angle at A perpendicular to the base BC the trian gles ABD and ADC about the perpendicular are sim ilar to the whole triangle ABC and to one another Prop 68 And since ABC is similar to ABD thus 189STOIQEIWN ELEMENTS BOOK 6 as CB is to BA so AB is to BD Def 61 And since three straightlines are proportional as the rst is to the third so the gure drawn on the rst is to the similar and similarly described gure on the second Prop 619 corr Thus as CB is to BD so the g ure drawn on CB is to the similar and similarly de scribed gure on BA And so for the same reasons as BC is to CD so the gure drawn on BC is to the gure on CA Hence also as BC is to BD and DC so the gure drawn on BC is to the sum of the similar and similarly described gures on BA and AC Prop 524 And BC is equal to BD and DC Thus the gure drawn on BC is also equal to the sum of the similar and similarly described gures on BA and AC Prop 59 Thus in rightangled triangles the gure drawn on the side subtending the rightangle is equal to the sum of the similar and similarly described gures on the sides surrounding the rightangle Which is the very thing it was required to show lb Proposition 32 If two triangles having two sides proportional to two sides are placed together at a single angle such that the corresponding sides are also parallel then the remaining sides of the triangles will be straighton with respect to one another C B E A D Let ABC and DCE be two triangles having the two sides BA and AC proportional to the two sides DC and DEso that as AB is to AC so DC is to DEand having side AB parallel to DC and AC to DE I say that side BC is straighton to CE For since AB is parallel to DC and the straightline AC has fallen across them the alternate angles BAC and ACD are equal to one another Prop 129 So for the same reasons CDE is also equal to ACD And hence BAC is equal to CDE And since ABC and DCE are two triangles having the one angle at A equal to the one 190STOIQEIWN ELEMENTS BOOK 6 angle at D and the sides about the equal angles pro portional so that as BA is to AC so CD is to DE triangle ABC is thus equiangular to triangle DCE Prop 66 Thus angle ABC is equal to DCE And an gle ACD was also shown to be equal to BAC Thus the whole angle ACE is equal to the two angles ABC and BAC Let ACB have been added to both Thus ACE and ACB are equal to BAC ACB and CBA But BAC ABC and ACB are equal to two rightangles Prop 132 Thus ACE and ACB are also equal to two rightangles Thus the two straightlines BC and CE not lying on the same side make adjacent angles ACE and ACB whose sum is equal to two rightangles with some straightline AC at the point C on it Thus BC is straighton to CE Prop 114 Thus if two triangles having two sides proportional to two sides are placed together at a single angle such that the corresponding sides are also parallel then the remaining sides of the triangles will be straighton with respect to one another Which is the very thing it was required to show lg Proposition 33 In equal circles angles have the same ratio as the ra tio of the circumferences on which they stand whether they are standing at the centers of the circles or at the circumferences Z L H K M J A D N B G E H L K M A D N B E G C F Let ABC and DEF be equal circles and let BGC and EHF be angles at their centers G and H respectively and BAC and EDF angles at their circumferences I say that as circumference BC is to circumference EF so angle BGC is to EHF and angle BAC to EDF For let any number whatsoever of consecutive cir cumferences CK and KL be made equal to circumfer ence BC and any number whatsoever FM and MN to circumference EF And let GK GL HM and HN have been joined Therefore since circumferences BC CK and KL are equal to one another angles BGC CGK and KGL are also equal to one another Prop 327 Thus as many times as circumference BL is divisible by BC so many 191STOIQEIWN ELEMENTS BOOK 6 times is angle BGL also divisible by BGC And so for the same reasons as many times as circumference NE is divisible by EF so many times is angle NHE also divisible by EHF Thus if circumference BL is equal to circumference EN then angle BGL is also equal to EHN Prop 327 and if circumference BL is greater than circumference EN then angle BGL is also greater than EHN and if BL is less than EN then BGL is also less than EHN So there are four magnitudes two circumferences BC and EF and two angles BGC and EHF And equal multiples have been taken of cir cumference BC and angle BGC namely circumference BL and angle BGL and of circumference EF and an gle EHF namely circumference EN and angle EHN And it has been shown that if circumference BL exceeds circumference EN then angle BGL also exceeds angle EHN and if BL is equal to EN then BGL is also equal to EHN and if BL is less than EN then BGL is also less than EHN Thus as circumference BC is to EF so angle BGC is to EHF Def 55 But as angle BGC is to EHF so angle BAC is to EDF Prop 515 For the former are double the latter re spectively Prop 320 Thus also as circumference BC is to circumference EF so angle BGC is to EHF and BAC to EDF Thus in equal circles angles have the same ratio as the ratio of the circumferences on which they stand whether they are standing at the centers of the circles or at the circumferences Which is the very thing it was required to show This is a straightforward generalization of Prop 327 192ELEMENTS BOOK 7 Elementary Number Theory The propositions contained in Books 79 are generally attributed to the school of Pythagoras 193STOIQEIWN z ELEMENTS BOOK 7 V Oroi Denitions 1 A unit is that according to which each existing thing is said to be one 2 And a number is a multitude composed of units 3 A number is part of another number the lesser of the greater when it measures the greater 4 But the lesser is parts of the greater when it does not measure it 5 And the greater number is a multiple of the lesser when it is measured by the lesser 6 An even number is one which can be divided in half 7 And an odd number is one which cannot be divided in half or which differs from an even number by a unit 8 An eventimeseven number is one which is mea sured by an even number according to an even number 9 And an eventimesodd number is one which is measured by an even number according to an odd number 10 And an oddtimesodd number is one which is measured by an odd number according to an odd number 11 A prime number is one which is measured by a unit alone 12 Numbers prime to one another are those which are measured by a unit alone as a common measure 13 A composite number is one which is measured by some number 14 And numbers composite to one another are those which are measured by some number as a common measure 15 A number is said to multiply another number when the number being multiplied is added to itself as many times as there are units in the former number and thereby some other number is produced 16 And when two numbers multiplying one another make some other number then the number so cre ated is called plane and its sides are the numbers which multiply one another 17 And when three numbers multiplying one another make some other number then the number so created is called solid and its sides are the numbers which multiply one another 18 A square number is an equal times an equal or a plane number contained by two equal numbers 19 And a cube number is an equal times an equal times an equal or a solid number contained by three equal numbers 194STOIQEIWN z ELEMENTS BOOK 7 20 Numbers are proportional when the rst is the same multiple or the same part or the same parts of the second that the third is of the fourth 21 Similar plane and solid numbers are those having proportional sides 22 A perfect number is that which is equal to its own parts In other words a number is a positive integer greater than unity In other words a number a is part of another number b if there exists some number n such that n a b In other words a number a is parts of another number b where a b if there exist distinct numbers m and n such that n a m b In other words an eventimeseven number is the product of two even numbers In other words an eventimesodd number is the product of an even and an odd number In other words an oddtimesodd number is the product of two odd numbers Literally rst In other words a perfect number is equal to the sum of its own factors a Proposition 1 Two unequal numbers being laid down and the lesser being continually subtracted in turn from the greater if the remainder never measures the number preceding it until a unit remains then the original num bers will be prime to one another E G A H F B D C For two unequal numbers AB and CD the lesser being continually subtracted in turn from the greater let the remainder never measure the number preceding it until a unit remains I say that AB and CD are prime to one anotherthat is to say that a unit alone measures both AB and CD For if AB and CD are not prime to one another then some number will measure them Let some number measure them and let it be E And let CD measuring BF leave FA less than itself and let AF measuring DG leave GC less than itself and let GC measuring FH leave a unit HA In fact since E measures CD and CD measures BF E thus also measures BF And E also measures the whole of BA Thus E will also measure the remainder 195STOIQEIWN z ELEMENTS BOOK 7 AF And AF measures DG Thus E also measures DG And E also measures the whole of DC Thus E will also measure the remainder CG And CG measures FH Thus E also measures FH And E also measures the whole of FA Thus E will also measure the remaining unit AH despite being a number The very thing is impossible Thus some number does not measure both the numbers AB and CD Thus AB and CD are prime to one another Which is the very thing it was required to show Here use is made of the unstated common notion that if a measures b and b measures c then a also measures c where all symbols denote numbers Here use is made of the unstated common notion that if a measures b and a measures part of b then a also measures the remainder of b where all symbols denote numbers b Proposition 2 To nd the greatest common measure of two given numbers which are not prime to one another B G F A E C D Let AB and CD be the two given numbers which are not prime to one another So it is required to nd the greatest common measure of AB and CD In fact if CD measures AB CD is thus a common measure of CD and AB since CD also measures itself And it is manifest that it is also the greatest com mon measure For nothing greater than CD can mea sure CD But if CD does not measure AB then some number will remain from AB and CD the lesser being contin ually subtracted in turn from the greater which will measure the number preceding it For a unit will not be left But if not AB and CD will be prime to one another Prop 71 The very opposite thing was assumed Thus some number will remain which will measure the num ber preceding it And let CD measuring BE leave EA less than itself and let EA measuring DF leave FC less than itself and let CF measure AE Therefore since CF measures AE and AE measures DF CF will thus also measure DF And it also measures itself Thus it will 196STOIQEIWN z ELEMENTS BOOK 7 also measure the whole of CD And CD measures BE Thus CF also measures BE And it also measures EA Thus it will also measure the whole of BA And it also measures CD Thus CF measures both AB and CD Thus CF is a common measure of AB and CD So I say that it is also the greatest common measure For if CF is not the greatest common measure of AB and CD then some number which is greater than CF will mea sure the numbers AB and CD Let it so measure AB and CD and let it be G And since G measures CD and CD measures BE G thus also measures BE And it also measures the whole of BA Thus it will also mea sure the remainder AE And AE measures DF Thus G will also measure DF And it also measures the whole of DC Thus it will also measure the remainder CF the greater measuring the lesser The very thing is im possible Thus some number which is greater than CF cannot measure the numbers AB and CD Thus CF is the greatest common measure of AB and CD Which is the very thing it was required to show Pri sma Corollary So it is manifest from this that if a number measures two numbers then it will also measure their greatest com mon measure Which is the very thing it was required to show g Proposition 3 To nd the greatest common measure of three given numbers which are not prime to one another F A B C D E Let A B and C be the three given numbers which are not prime to one another So it is required to nd the greatest common measure of A B and C For let the greatest common measure D of the two numbers A and B have been taken Prop 72 So D either measures or does not measure C First of all let it measure C And it also measures A and B Thus D 197STOIQEIWN z ELEMENTS BOOK 7 measures A B and C Thus D is a common measure of A B and C So I say that it is also the greatest common measure For if D is not the greatest common measure of A B and C then some number greater than D will measure the numbers A B and C Let it so measure A B and C and let it be E Therefore since E measures A B and C it will thus also measure A and B Thus it will also measure the greatest common mea sure of A and B Prop 72 corr And D is the greatest common measure of A and B Thus E measures D the greater measuring the lesser The very thing is impossi ble Thus some number which is greater than D cannot measure the numbers A B and C Thus D is the great est common measure of A B and C So let D not measure C I say rst of all that C and D are not prime to one another For since A B C are not prime to one another some number will measure them So the number measuring A B and C will also measure A and B and it will also measure the greatest common measure D of A and B Prop 72 corr And it also measures C Thus some number will measure the numbers D and C Thus D and C are not prime to one another Therefore let their greatest common measure E have been taken Prop 72 And since E measures D and D measures A and B E thus also measures A and B And it also measures C Thus E measures A B and C Thus E is a common measure of A B and C So I say that it is also the greatest common measure For if E is not the greatest common measure of A B and C then some number greater than E will measure the num bers A B and C Let it so measure A B and C and let it be F And since F measures A B and C it also measures A and B Thus it will also measure the great est common measure of A and B Prop 72 corr And D is the greatest common measure of A and B Thus F measures D And it also measures C Thus F measures D and C Thus it will also measure the greatest com mon measure of D and C Prop 72 corr And E is the greatest common measure of D and C Thus F measures E the greater measuring the lesser The very thing is impossible Thus some number which is greater than E does not measure the numbers A B and C Thus E is the greatest common measure of A B and C Which is the very thing it was required to show d Proposition 4 Any number is either part or parts of any other num ber the lesser of the greater Let A and BC be two numbers and let BC be the lesser I say that BC is either part or parts of A 198STOIQEIWN z ELEMENTS BOOK 7 For A and BC are either prime to one another or not Let A and BC rst of all be prime to one another So separating BC into its constituent units each of the units in BC will be some part of A Hence BC is parts of A D C F E B A So let A and BC be not prime to one another So BC either measures or does not measure A Therefore if BC measures A then BC is part of A And if not let the greatest common measure D of A and BC have been taken Prop 72 and let BC have been divided into BE EF and FC equal to D And since D measures A D is a part of A And D is equal to each of BE EF and FC Thus BE EF and FC are also each part of A Hence BC is parts of A Thus any number is either part or parts of any other number the lesser of the greater Which is the very thing it was required to show e Proposition 5 If a number is part of a number and another num ber is the same part of another then the sum of the leading numbers will also be the same part of the sum of the following numbers that one number is of an other D C G B F H E A For let a number A be part of a number BC and 199STOIQEIWN z ELEMENTS BOOK 7 another number D be the same part of another num ber EF that A is of BC I say that the sum A D is also the same part of the sum BC EF that A is of BC For since whichever part A is of BC D is the same part of EF thus as many numbers as are in BC equal to A so many numbers are also in EF equal to D Let BC have been divided into BG and GC equal to A and EF into EH and HF equal to D So the multitude of divisions BG GC will be equal to the multitude of di visions EH HF And since BG is equal to A and EH to D thus BG EH is also equal to A D So for the same reasons GC HF is also equal to A D Thus as many numbers as are in BC equal to A so many are also in BC EF equal to A D Thus as many times as BC is divisible by A so many times is the sum BC EF also divisible by the sum A D Thus whichever part A is of BC the sum A D is also the same part of the sum BC EF Which is the very thing it was required to show In modern notation this proposition states that if a 1n b and c 1n d then a c 1n b d where all symbols denote numbers Proposition 6 If a number is parts of a number and another num ber is the same parts of another then the sum of the leading numbers will also be the same parts of the sum of the following numbers that one number is of an other E G A C D H F B For let a number AB be parts of a number C and an other number DE be the same parts of another num ber F that AB is of C I say that the sum AB DE is also the same parts of the sum C F that AB is of C For since whichever parts AB is of C DE is also the same parts of F thus as many parts of C as are in AB so many parts of F are also in DE Let AB have been divided into the parts of C AG and GB and DE into the parts of F DH and HE So the multitude of divisions AG GB will be equal to the multitude of divisions DH 200STOIQEIWN z ELEMENTS BOOK 7 HE And since whichever part AG is of C DH is also the same part of F thus whichever part AG is of C the sum AG DH is also the same part of the sum C F Prop 75 And so for the same reasons whichever part GB is of C the sum GB HE is also the same part of the sum C F Thus whichever parts AB is of C the sum AB DE is also the same parts of the sum C F Which is the very thing it was required to show In modern notation this proposition states that if a mn b and c mn d then a c mn b d where all symbols denote numbers z Proposition 7 If a number is that part of a number that a part taken away is of a part taken away then the remain der will also be the same part of the remainder that the whole is of the whole E A G C D F B For let a number AB be that part of a number CD that a part taken away AE is of a part taken away CF I say that the remainder EB is also the same part of the remainder FD that the whole AB is of the whole CD For whichever part AE is of CF let EB also be the same part of CG And since whichever part AE is of CF EB is also the same part of CG thus whichever part AE is of CF AB is also the same part of GF Prop 75 And whichever part AE is of CF AB is also assumed to be the same part of CD Thus also whichever part AB is of GF AB is also the same part of CD Thus GF is equal to CD Let CF have been subtracted from both Thus the remainder GC is equal to the remainder FD And since whichever part AE is of CF EB is also the same part of GC and GC is equal to FD thus whichever part AE is of CF EB is also the same part of FD But whichever part AE is of CF AB is also the same part of CD Thus the remain der EB is also the same part of the remainder FD that the whole AB is of the whole CD Which is the very thing it was required to show In modern notation this proposition states that if a 1n b and c 1n d then a c 1n b d where all symbols denote numbers h Proposition 8 If a number is those parts of a number that a part taken away is of a part taken away then the remain der will also be the same parts of the remainder that the 201STOIQEIWN z ELEMENTS BOOK 7 whole is of the whole C A E F G M K N L B H D For let a number AB be those parts of a number CD that a part taken away AE is of a part taken away CF I say that the remainder EB is also the same parts of the remainder FD that the whole AB is of the whole CD For let GH be laid down equal to AB Thus whichever parts GH is of CD AE is also the same parts of CF Let GH have been divided into the parts of CD GK and KH and AE into the part of CF AL and LE So the multitude of divisions GK KH will be equal to the multitude of divisions AL LE And since whichever part GK is of CD AL is also the same part of CF and CD is greater than CF GK is thus also greater than AL Let GM be made equal to AL Thus whichever part GK is of CD GM is also the same part of CF Thus the remainder MK is also the same part of the remainder FD that the whole GK is of the whole CD Prop 75 Again since whichever part KH is of CD EL is also the same part of CF and CD is greater than CF HK is thus also greater than EL Let KN be made equal to EL Thus whichever part KH is of CD KN is also the same part of CF Thus the remain der NH is also the same part of the remainder FD that the whole KH is of the whole CD Prop 75 And the remainder MK was also shown to be the same part of the remainder FD that the whole GK is of the whole CD Thus the sum MK NH is the same parts of DF that the whole HG is of the whole CD And the sum MK NH is equal to EB and HG to BA Thus the remainder EB is also the same parts of the remainder FD that the whole AB is of the whole CD Which is the very thing it was required to show In modern notation this proposition states that if a mn b and c mn d then a c mn b d where all symbols denote numbers j Proposition 9 If a number is part of a number and another num ber is the same part of another also alternately whichever part or parts the rst number is of the third the second number will also be the same part or 202STOIQEIWN z ELEMENTS BOOK 7 the same parts of the fourth F A C G B D E H For let a number A be part of a number BC and an other number D be the same part of another EF that A is of BC I say that also alternately whichever part or parts A is of D BC is also the same part or parts of EF For since whichever part A is of BC D is also the same part of EF thus as many numbers as are in BC equal to A so many are also in EF equal to D Let BC have been divided into BG and GC equal to A and EF into EH and HF equal to D So the multitude of di visions BG GC will be equal to the multitude of divi sions EH HF And since the numbers BG and GC are equal to one another and the numbers EH and HF are also equal to one another and the multitude of divisions BG GC is equal to the multitude of divisions EH HC thus whichever part or parts BG is of EH GC is also the same part or the same parts of HF And hence whichever part or parts BG is of EH the sum BC is also the same part or the same parts of the sum EF Props 75 76 And BG is equal to A and EH to D Thus whichever part or parts A is of D BC is also the same part or the same parts of EF Which is the very thing it was required to show In modern notation this proposition states that if a 1n b and c 1n d then if a kl c then b kl d where all symbols denote numbers i Proposition 10 If a number is parts of a number and another num ber is the same parts of another also alternately whichever parts or part the rst number is of the third the second will also be the same parts or the same part of the fourth For let a number AB be parts of a number C and another number DE be the same parts of another F I say that also alternately whichever parts or part 203STOIQEIWN z ELEMENTS BOOK 7 AB is of DE C is also the same parts or the same part of F A B G C E H D F For since whichever parts AB is of C DE is also the same parts of F thus as many parts of C as are in AB so many parts of F are also in DE Let AB have been divided into the parts of C AG and GB and DE into the parts of F DH and HE So the multitude of divisions AG GB will be equal to the multitude of di visions DH HE And since whichever part AG is of C DH is also the same part of F also alternately whichever part or parts AG is of DH C is also the same part or the same parts of F Prop 79 And so for the same reasons whichever part or parts GB is of HE C is also the same part or the same parts of F Prop 79 And so whichever part or parts AG is of DH GB is also the same part or the same parts of HE And thus whichever part or parts AG is of DH AB is also the same part or the same parts of DE Props 75 76 But whichever part or parts AG is of DH C was also shown to be the same part or the same parts of F And thus whichever parts or part AB is of DE C is also the same parts or the same part of F Which is the very thing it was required to show In modern notation this proposition states that if a mn b and c mn d then if a kl c then b kl d where all symbols denote numbers ia Proposition 11 If as the whole of a number is to the whole of an other so a part taken away is to a part taken away then the remainder will also be to the remainder as the whole is to the whole Let the whole AB be to the whole CD as the part taken away AE is to the part taken away CF I say that the remainder EB is to the remainder FD as the whole AB is to the whole CD 204STOIQEIWN z ELEMENTS BOOK 7 A F E C B D For since as AB is to CD so AE is to CF thus whichever part or parts AB is of CD AE is also the same part or the same parts of CF Def 720 Thus the remainder EB is also the same part or parts of the remainder FD that AB is of CD Props 77 78 Thus as EB is to FD so AB is to CD Def 720 Which is the very thing it was required to show In modern notation this proposition states that if a b c d then a b a c b d where all symbols denote numbers ib Proposition 12 If any multitude whatsoever of numbers are propor tional then as one of the leading numbers is to one of the following so the sum of all of the leading numbers will be to the sum of all of the following D A B C Let any multitude whatsoever of numbers A B C D be proportional such that as A is to B so C is to D I say that as A is to B so A C is to B D For since as A is to B so C is to D thus whichever part or parts A is of B C is also the same part or parts of D Def 720 Thus the sum A C is also the same part or the same parts of the sum B D that A is of B Props 75 76 Thus as A is to B so A C is to B D Def 720 Which is the very thing it was required to show 205STOIQEIWN z ELEMENTS BOOK 7 In modern notation this proposition states that if a b c d then a b a c b d where all symbols denote numbers ig Proposition 13 If four numbers are proportional then they will also be proportional alternately D A B C Let the four numbers A B C and D be proportional such that as A is to B so C is to D I say that they will also be proportional alternately such that as A is to C so B is to D For since as A is to B so C is to D thus whichever part or parts A is of B C is also the same part or the same parts of D Def 720 Thus alterately whichever part or parts A is of C B is also the same part or the same parts of D Props 79 710 Thus as A is to C so B is to D Def 720 Which is the very thing it was required to show In modern notation this proposition states that if a b c d then a c b d where all symbols denote numbers id Proposition 14 If there are any multitude of numbers whatsoever and some other numbers of equal multitude to them which are also in the same ratio taken two by two then they will also be in the same ratio via equality F A D B C E Let there be any multitude of numbers whatsoever A B C and some other numbers D E F of equal multitude to them which are in the same ratio taken two by two such that as A is to B so D is to E and as B is to C so E is to F I say that also via equality as A is to C so D is to F For since as A is to B so D is to E thus alternately as A is to D so B is to E Prop 713 Again since as B is to C so E is to F thus alternately as B is 206STOIQEIWN z ELEMENTS BOOK 7 to E so C is to F Prop 713 And as B is to E so A is to D Thus also as A is to D so C is to F Thus alternately as A is to C so D is to F Prop 713 Which is the very thing it was required to show In modern notation this proposition states that if a b d e and b c e f then a c d f where all symbols denote numbers ie Proposition 15 If a unit measures some number and another num ber measures some other number as many times then also alternately the unit will measure the third num ber as many times as the second number measures the fourth F H D A B E G C K L For let a unit A measure some number BC and let another number D measure some other number EF as many times I say that also alternately the unit A also measures the number D as many times as BC measures EF For since the unit A measures the number BC as many times as D measures EF thus as many units as are in BC so many numbers are also in EF equal to D Let BC have been divided into its constituent units BG GH and HC and EF into the divisions EK KL and LF equal to D So the multitude of units BG GH HC will be equal to the multitude of divisions EK KL LF And since the units BG GH and HC are equal to one another and the numbers EK KL and LF are also equal to one another and the multitude of the units BG GH HC is equal to the multitude of the numbers EK KL LF thus as the unit BG is to the number EK so the unit GH will be to the number KL and the unit HC to the number LF And thus as one of the leading numbers is to one of the following so the sum of all of the leading will be to the sum of all of the following Prop 712 Thus as the unit BG is to the number EK so BC is to EF And the unit BG is equal to the unit A and the number EK to the number D Thus as the unit A is to the number D so BC is to EF Thus the unit A measures the number D as many times as BC measures EF Def 720 Which is the very thing it was required to show This proposition is a special case of Prop 79 207STOIQEIWN z ELEMENTS BOOK 7 i Proposition 16 If two numbers multiplying one another make some numbers then the numbers generated from them will be equal to one another E A B C D Let A and B be two numbers And let A make C by multiplying B and let B make D by multiplying A I say that C is equal to D For since A has made C by multiplying B B thus measures C according to the units in A Def 715 And the unit E also measures the number A according to the units in it Thus the unit E measures the number A as many times as B measures C Thus alternately the unit E measures the number B as many times as A mea sures C Prop 715 Again since B has made D by multiplying A A thus measures D according to the units in B Def 715 And the unit E also measures B ac cording to the units in it Thus the unit E measures the number B as many times as A measures D And the unit E was measuring the number B as many times as A measures C Thus A measures each of C and D an equal number of times Thus C is equal to D Which is the very thing it was required to show In modern notation this proposition states that a b b a where all symbols denote numbers iz Proposition 17 If a number multiplying two numbers makes some numbers then the numbers generated from them will have the same ratio as the multiplied numbers E A B D F C For let the number A make the numbers D and E by multiplying the two numbers B and C respec tively I say that as B is to C so D is to E For since A has made D by multiplying B B thus measures D according to the units in A Def 715 And 208STOIQEIWN z ELEMENTS BOOK 7 the unit F also measures the number A according to the units in it Thus the unit F measures the number A as many times as B measures D Thus as the unit F is to the number A so B is to D Def 720 And so for the same reasons as the unit F is to the number A so C is to E And thus as B is to D so C is to E Thus alternately as B is to C so D is to E Prop 713 Which is the very thing it was required to show In modern notation this proposition states that if d a b and e a c then d e b c where all symbols denote numbers ih Proposition 18 If two numbers multiplying some number make some other numbers then the numbers generated from them will have the same ratio as the multiplying num bers E B A C D For let the two numbers A and B make the numbers D and E respectively by multiplying some number C I say that as A is to B so D is to E For since A has made D by multiplying C C has thus also made D by multiplying A Prop 716 So for the same reasons C has also made E by multiplying B So the number C has made D and E by multiplying the two numbers A and B respectively Thus as A is to B so D is to E Prop 717 Which is the very thing it was required to show In modern notation this propositions states that if a c d and b c e then a b d e where all symbols denote numbers ij Proposition 19 If four number are proportional then the number cre ated from multiplying the rst and fourth will be equal to the number created from multiplying the second and third And if the number created from multiplying the rst and fourth is equal to the number created from multiplying the second and third then the four num bers will be proportional Let A B C and D be four proportional numbers such that as A is to B so C is to D And let A make E by multiplying D and let B make F by multiplying C I say that E is equal to F 209STOIQEIWN z ELEMENTS BOOK 7 G A B C D E F For let A make G by multiplying C Therefore since A has made G by multiplying C and has made E by multiplying D the number A has made G and E by mul tiplying the two numbers C and D respectively Thus as C is to D so G is to E Prop 717 But as C is to D so A is to B Thus also as A is to B so G is to E Again since A has made G by multiplying C but in fact B has also made F by multiplying C the two numbers A and B have made G and F respectively by multiplying some number C Thus as A is to B so G is to F Prop 718 But also as A is to B so G is to E And thus as G is to E so G is to F Thus G has the same ratio to each of E and F Thus E is equal to F Prop 59 So again let E be equal to F I say that as A is to B so C is to D For with the same construction since E is equal to F thus as G is to E so G is to F Prop 57 But as G is to E so C is to D Prop 717 And as G is to F so A is to B Prop 718 And thus as A is to B so C is to D Which is the very thing it was required to show In modern notation this proposition reads that if a b c d then a d b c and vice versa where all symbols denote numbers k Proposition 20 The least numbers of those numbers having the same ratio measure those numbers having the same ra tio as them an equal number of times the greater mea suring the greater and the lesser the lesser For let CD and EF be the least numbers having the same ratio as A and B respectively I say that CD mea sures A the same number of times as EF measures B 210STOIQEIWN z ELEMENTS BOOK 7 F A B C G D E H For CD is not parts of A For if possible let it be parts of A Thus EF is also the same parts of B that CD is of A Def 720 Prop 713 Thus as many parts of A as are in CD so many parts of B are also in EF Let CD have been divided into the parts of A CG and GD and EF into the parts of B EH and HF So the multi tude of divisions CG GD will be equal to the multitude of divisions EH HF And since the numbers CG and GD are equal to one another and the numbers EH and HF are also equal to one another and the multitude of divisions CG GD is equal to the multitude of divi sions EH HF thus as CG is to EH so GD is to HF Thus as one of the leading numbers is to one of the following so will the sum of all of the leading num bers be to the sum of all of the following Prop 712 Thus as CG is to EH so CD is to EF Thus CG and EH are in the same ratio as CD and EF being less than them The very thing is impossible For CD and EF were assumed to be the least of those numbers having the same ratio as them Thus CD is not parts of A Thus it is a part of A Prop 74 And EF is the same part of B that CD is of A Def 720 Prop 713 Thus CD measures A the same number of times that EF measures B Which is the very thing it was required to show ka Proposition 21 Numbers prime to one another are the least of those numbers having the same ratio as them Let A and B be numbers prime to one another I say that A and B are the least of those numbers having the same ratio as them For if not then there will be some numbers less than A and B which are in the same ratio as A and B Let them be C and D 211STOIQEIWN z ELEMENTS BOOK 7 E A B C D Therefore since the least numbers of those num bers having the same ratio measure those numbers having the same ratio as them an equal number of times the greater measuring the greater and the lesser the lesserthat is to say the leading measuring the leading and the following the followingC thus mea sures A the same number of times that D measures B Prop 720 So as many times as C measures A so many units let there be in E Thus D also measures B accord ing to the units in E And since C measures A according to the units in E E thus also measures A according to the units in C Prop 716 So for the same reasons E also measures B according to the units in D Prop 716 Thus E measures A and B which are prime to one an other The very thing is impossible Thus there cannot be any numbers less than A and B which are in the same ratio as A and B Thus A and B are the least of those numbers having the same ratio as them Which is the very thing it was required to show kb Proposition 22 The least numbers of those numbers having the same ratio as them are prime to one another E A B C D Let A and B be the least numbers of those numbers having the same ratio as them I say that A and B are prime to one another For if they are not prime to one another then some number will measure them Let it so measure them and let it be C And as many times as C measures A so 212STOIQEIWN z ELEMENTS BOOK 7 many units let there be in D And as many times as C measures B so many units let there be in E Since C measures A according to the units in D C has thus made A by multiplying D Def 715 So for the same reasons C has also made B by multiplying E So the number C has made A and B by multiplying the two numbers D and E respectively Thus as D is to E so A is to B Prop 717 Thus D and E are in the same ratio as A and B being less than them The very thing is impossible Thus some number does not measure the numbers A and B Thus A and B are prime to one another Which is the very thing it was required to show kg Proposition 23 If two numbers are prime to one another then a num ber measuring one of them will be prime to the remaining one A B C D Let A and B be two numbers which are prime to one another and let some number C measure A I say that C and B are also prime to one another For if C and B are not prime to one another then some number will measure C and B Let it so mea sure them and let it be D Since D measures C and C measures A D thus also measures A And D also mea sures B Thus D measures A and B which are prime to one another The very thing is impossible Thus some number does not measure the numbers C and B Thus C and B are prime to one another Which is the very thing it was required to show kd Proposition 24 If two numbers are prime to some number then the number created from multiplying the former two num bers will also be prime to the latter number 213STOIQEIWN z ELEMENTS BOOK 7 F A B C D E For let A and B be two numbers which are both prime to some number C And let A make D by multi plying B I say that C and D are prime to one another For if C and D are not prime to one another then some number will measure C and D Let it so mea sure them and let it be E And since C and A are prime to one another and some number E measures C A and E are thus prime to one another Prop 723 So as many times as E measures D so many units let there be in F Thus F also measures D according to the units in E Prop 716 Thus E has made D by multiply ing F Def 715 But in fact A has also made D by multiplying B Thus the number created from multi plying E and F is equal to the number created from multiplying A and B And if the rectangle contained by the two outermost is equal to the rectangle con tained by the middle two then the four numbers are proportional Prop 615 Thus as E is to A so B is to F And A and E are prime to one another And numbers prime to one another are also the least of those numbers having the same ratio Prop 721 And the least numbers of those numbers having the same ratio measure those numbers having the same ratio as them an equal number of times the greater measuring the greater and the lesser the lesserthat is to say the leading measuring the leading and the following the following Prop 720 Thus E measures B And it also measures C Thus E measures B and C which are prime to one another The very thing is impossible Thus some number cannot measure the numbers C and D Thus C and D are prime to one another Which is the very thing it was required to show ke Proposition 25 If two numbers are prime to one another then the number created from squaring one of them will be prime to the remaining number Let A and B be two numbers which are prime to 214STOIQEIWN z ELEMENTS BOOK 7 one another And let A make C by multiplying itself I say that B and C are prime to one another D A B C For let D be made equal to A Since A and B are prime to one another and A is equal to D D and B are thus also prime to one another Thus D and A are each prime to B Thus the number created from multily ing D and A will also be prime to B Prop 724 And C is the number created from multiplying D and A Thus C and B are prime to one another Which is the very thing it was required to show k Proposition 26 If two numbers are both prime to each of two numbers then the numbers created from multiplying them will also be prime to one another F A C B D E For let two numbers A and B both be prime to each of two numbers C and D And let A make E by mul tiplying B and let C make F by multiplying D I say that E and F are prime to one another For since A and B are each prime to C the num ber created from multiplying A and B will thus also be prime to C Prop 724 And E is the number cre ated from multiplying A and B Thus E and C are prime to one another So for the same reasons E and D are also prime to one another Thus C and D are each prime to E Thus the number created from multiply ing C and D will also be prime to E Prop 724 And F is the number created from multiplying C and D Thus E and F are prime to one another Which is the very thing it was required to show 215STOIQEIWN z ELEMENTS BOOK 7 kz Proposition 27 If two numbers are prime to one another and each makes some number by multiplying itself then the num bers created from them will be prime to one another and if the original numbers make some more numbers by multiplying the created numbers then these will also be prime to one another and this always happens with the extremes F A B C D E Let A and B be two numbers prime to one another and let A make C by multiplying itself and let it make D by multiplying C And let B make E by multiplying itself and let it make F by multiplying E I say that C and E and D and F are prime to one another For since A and B are prime to one another and A has made C by multiplying itself C and B are thus prime to one another Prop 725 Therefore since C and B are prime to one another and B has made E by mul tiplying itself C and E are thus prime to one another Prop 725 Again since A and B are prime to one an other and B has made E by multiplying itself A and E are thus prime to one another Prop 725 Therefore since the two numbers A and C are both prime to each of the two numbers B and E the number created from multiplying A and C is thus prime to the number cre ated from multiplying B and E Prop 726 And D is the number created from multiplying A and C and F the number created from multiplying B and E Thus D and F are prime to one another Which is the very thing it was required to show In modern notation this proposition states that if a is prime to b then a2 is also prime to b2 as well as a3 to b3 etc where all symbols denote numbers kh Proposition 28 If two numbers are prime to one another then their sum will also be prime to each of them And if the sum of two numbers is prime to any one of them then the original numbers will also be prime to one another 216STOIQEIWN z ELEMENTS BOOK 7 C D A B For let the two numbers AB and BC which are prime to one another be laid down together I say that their sum AC is also prime to each of AB and BC For if CA and AB are not prime to one another then some number will measure CA and AB Let it so mea sure them and let it be D Therefore since D measures CA and AB it will thus also measure the remainder BC And it also measures BA Thus D measures AB and BC which are prime to one another The very thing is impossible Thus some number cannot measure both the numbers CA and AB Thus CA and AB are prime to one another So for the same reasons AC and CB are also prime to one another Thus CA is prime to each of AB and BC So again let CA and AB be prime to one another I say that AB and BC are also prime to one another For if AB and BC are not prime to one another then some number will measure AB and BC Let it so mea sure them and let it be D And since D measures each of AB and BC it will thus also measure the whole of CA And it also measures AB Thus D measures CA and AB which are prime to one another The very thing is impossible Thus some number cannot measure both the numbers AB and BC Thus AB and BC are prime to one another Which is the very thing it was required to show kj Proposition 29 Every prime number is prime to every number which it does not measure C A B Let A be a prime number and let it not measure B I say that B and A are prime to one another For if B and A are not prime to one another then some number will measure them Let C measure them Since C measures B and A does not measure B C is thus not the same as A And since C measures B and A it thus also measures A which is prime despite not being the same as it The very thing is impossible Thus some number cannot measure both B and A Thus A and B are prime to one another Which is the very thing it was required to 217STOIQEIWN z ELEMENTS BOOK 7 show l Proposition 30 If two numbers make some number by multiplying one another and some prime number measures the num ber so created from them then it will also measure one of the original numbers E A B C D For let two numbers A and B make C by multiplying one another and let some prime number D measure C I say that D measures one of A and B For let it not measure A And since D is prime A and D are thus prime to one another Prop 729 And as many times as D measures C so many units let there be in E Therefore since D measures C according to the units E D has thus made C by multiplying E Def 715 But in fact A has also made C by multi plying B Thus the number created from multiplying D and E is equal to the number created from mul tiplying A and B Thus as D is to A so B is to E Prop 719 And D and A are prime to one another and numbers prime to one another are also the least of those numbers having the same ratio Prop 721 and the least numbers measure those numbers hav ing the same ratio as them an equal number of times the greater measuring the greater and the lesser the lesserthat is to say the leading measuring the lead ing and the following the following Prop 720 Thus D measures B So similarly we can also show that if D does not measure B then it will measure A Thus D measures one of A and B Which is the very thing it was required to show la Proposition 31 Every composite number is measured by some prime number Let A be a composite number I say that A is measured by some prime number For since A is composite some number will measure it Let it so measure A and let it be B And if B 218STOIQEIWN z ELEMENTS BOOK 7 is prime then that which was prescribed has happened And if B is composite then some number will measure it Let it so measure B and let it be C And since C measures B and B measures A C thus also measures A And if C is prime then that which was prescribed has happened And if C is composite then some number will measure it So in this manner of continued inves tigation some prime number will be found which will measure the number preceding it which will also mea sure A And if such a number cannot be found then an innite series of numbers each of which is less than the preceding will measure the number A The very thing is impossible for numbers Thus some prime number will eventually be found which will measure the number preceding it which will also measure A C A B Thus every composite number is measured by some prime number Which is the very thing it was required to show lb Proposition 32 Every number is either prime or is measured by some prime number A Let A be a number I say that A is either prime or is measured by some prime number In fact if A is prime then that which was prescribed has happened And if it is composite then some prime number will measure it Prop 731 Thus every number is either prime or is measured by some prime number Which is the very thing it was required to show lg Proposition 33 To nd the least of those numbers having the same ratio as any given multitude of numbers Let A B and C be any given multitude of numbers So it is required to nd the least of those numbers hav ing the same ratio as A B and C For A B and C are either prime to one another or not In fact if A B and C are prime to one another then they are the least of those numbers having the same ratio as them Prop 722 219STOIQEIWN z ELEMENTS BOOK 7 L M A B C D E F G H K And if not let the greatest common measure D of A B and C have be taken Prop 73 And as many times as D measures A B C so many units let there be in E F G respectively And thus E F G mea sure A B C respectively according to the units in D Prop 715 Thus E F G measure A B C respec tively an equal number of times Thus E F G are in the same ratio as A B C respectively Def 720 So I say that they are also the least of those numbers hav ing the same ratio as A B C For if E F G are not the least of those numbers having the same ratio as A B C respectively then there will be some numbers less than E F G which are in the same ratio as A B C respectively Let them be H K L Thus H measures A the same number of times that K L also measure B C respectively And as many times as H measures A so many units let there be in M Thus K L measure B C respectively according to the units in M And since H measures A according to the units in M M thus also measures A according to the units in H Prop 715 So for the same reasons M also measures B C accord ing to the units in K L respectively Thus M measures A B and C And since H measures A according to the units in M H has thus made A by multiplying M So for the same reasons E has also made A by multiply ing D Thus the number created from multiplying E and D is equal to the number created from multi plying H and M Thus as E is to H so M is to D Prop 719 And E is greater than H Thus M is also greater than D Prop 513 And M measures A B and C The very thing is impossible For D was assumed to be the greatest common measure of A B and C Thus there cannot be any numbers less than E F G which are in the same ratio as A B C respec tively Thus E F G are the least of those numbers having the same ratio as A B C respectively Which is the very thing it was required to show ld Proposition 34 To nd the least number which two given numbers both measure Let A and B be the two given numbers So it is re 220STOIQEIWN z ELEMENTS BOOK 7 quired to nd the least number which they both mea sure F A B C D E For A and B are either prime to one another or not Let them rst of all be prime to one another And let A make C by multiplying B Thus B has also made C by multiplying A Prop 716 Thus A and B both measure C So I say that C is also the least num ber which they both measure For if not A and B will both measure some other number which is less than C Let them both measure D which is less than C And as many times as A measures D so many units let there be in E And as many times as B measures D so many units let there be in F Thus A has made D by multiplying E and B has made D by multiply ing F Thus the number created from multiplying A and E is equal to the number created from multi plying B and F Thus as A is to B so F is to E Prop 719 And A and B are prime to one another and prime numbers are the least of those numbers having the same ratio Prop 721 and the least num bers measure those numbers having the same ratio as them an equal number of times the greater measuring the greater and the lesser the lesser Prop 720 Thus B measures E as the following number measuring the following And since A has made C and D by multi plying B and E respectively thus as B is to E so C is to D Prop 717 And B measures E Thus C also measures D the greater measuring the lesser The very thing is impossible Thus A and B do not both mea sure some number which is less than C Thus C is the least number which is measured by both A and B H A D B E F C G So let A and B be not prime to one another And let the least numbers F and E have been taken having the same ratio as A and B respectively Prop 733 221STOIQEIWN z ELEMENTS BOOK 7 Thus the number created from multiplying A and E is equal to the number created from multiplying B and F Prop 719 And let A make C by multiplying E Thus B has also made C by multiplying F Thus A and B both measure C So I say that C is also the least number which they both measure For if not A and B will both measure some number which is less than C Let them both measure D which is less than C And as many times as A measures D so many units let there be in G And as many times as B measures D so many units let there be in H Thus A has made D by multiplying G and B has made D by multiplying H Thus the number created from multiplying A and G is equal to the number created from multiplying B and H Thus as A is to B so H is to G Prop 719 And as A is to B so F is to E Thus also as F is to E so H is to G And F and E are the least num bers having the same ratio as A and B and the least numbers measure those numbers having the same ra tio an equal number of times the greater measuring the greater and the lesser the lesser Prop 720 Thus E measures G And since A has made C and D by mul tiplying E and G respectively thus as E is to G so C is to D Prop 717 And E measures G Thus C also measures D the greater measuring the lesser The very thing is impossible Thus A and B do not both mea sure some number which is less than C Thus C is the least number which is measured by both A and B Which is the very thing it was required to show le Proposition 35 If two numbers both measure some number then the least number measured by them will also measure the same number D A B E C F For let two numbers A and B both measure some number CD and let E be the least number mea sured by both A and B I say that E also measures CD For if E does not measure CD then let E leave CF less than itself in measuring DF And since A and B both measure E and E measures DF A and B will thus also measure DF And A and B also measure the whole of CD Thus they will also measure the remainder CF which is less than E The very thing is impossible Thus E cannot not measure CD Thus E measures 222STOIQEIWN z ELEMENTS BOOK 7 CD Which is the very thing it was required to show l Proposition 36 To nd the least number which three given numbers all measure Let A B and C be the three given numbers So it is required to nd the least number which they all mea sure F A B C D E For let the least number D measured by the two numbers A and B have been taken Prop 734 So C either measures or does not measure D Let it rst of all measure D And A and B also measure D Thus A B and C all measure D So I say that D is also the least number measured by A B and C For if not A B and C will all measure some number which is less than D Let them measure E which is less than D Since A B and C all measure E then A and B thus also measure E Thus the least number measured by A and B will also measure E Prop 735 And D is the least number measured by A and B Thus D will measure E the greater measuring the lesser The very thing is impossible Thus A B and C cannot all measure some number which is less than D Thus A B and C all measure the least number D So again let C not measure D And let the least number E measured by C and D have been taken Prop 734 Since A and B measure D and D measures E A and B thus also measure E And C also measures E Thus A B and C also measure E So I say that E is also the least number measured by A B and C For if not A B and C will all measure some number which is less than E Let them measure F which is less than E Since A B and C all measure F A and B thus also measure F Thus the least number measured by A and B will also measure F Prop 735 And D is the least number measured by A and B Thus D measures F And C also measures F Thus D and C both measure F Hence the least number measured by D and C will also measure F Prop 735 And E 223STOIQEIWN z ELEMENTS BOOK 7 is the least number measured by C and D Thus E measures F the greater measuring the lesser The very thing is impossible Thus A B and C cannot measure some number which is less than E Thus E is the least number which is measured by A B and C Which is the very thing it was required to show lz Proposition 37 If a number is measured by some number then the number measured will have a part called the same as the measuring number D B A C For let the number A be measured by some number B I say that A has a part called the same as B For as many times as B measures A so many units let there be in C Since B measures A according to the units in C and the unit D also measures C according to the units in it the unit D thus measures the number C as many times as B measures A Thus alternately the unit D measures the number B as many times as C measures A Prop 715 Thus whichever part the unit D is of the number B C is also the same part of A And the unit D is a part of the number B called the same as it ie a Bth part Thus C is also a part of A called the same as B ie C is the Bth part of A Hence A has a part C which is called the same as B ie A has a Bth part Which is the very thing it was required to show lh Proposition 38 If a number has any part whatever then it will be mea sured by a number called the same as the part D A B C For let the number A have any part whatever B And let the number C be called the same as the part B ie B is the Cth part of A I say that C measures A For since B is a part of A called the same as C and the unit D is also a part of C called the same as it ie 224STOIQEIWN z ELEMENTS BOOK 7 D is the Cth part of C thus whichever part the unit D is of the number C B is also the same part of A Thus the unit D measures the number C as many times as B measures A Thus alternately the unit D measures the number B as many times as C measures A Prop 715 Thus C measures A Which is the very thing it was required to show lj Proposition 39 To nd the least number that will have given parts H A B C D E F G Let A B and C be the given parts So it is required to nd the least number which will have the parts A B and C ie an Ath part a Bth part and a Cth part For let D E and F be numbers having the same names as the parts A B and C respectively And let the least number G measured by D E and F have been taken Prop 736 Thus G has parts called the same as D E and F Prop 737 And A B and C are parts called the same as D E and F respectively Thus G has the parts A B and C So I say that G is also the least number having the parts A B and C For if not there will be some number less than G which will have the parts A B and C Let it be H Since H has the parts A B and C H will thus be measured by numbers called the same as the parts A B and C Prop 738 And D E and F are numbers called the same as the parts A B and C respectively Thus H is measured by D E and F And H is less than G The very thing is impossible Thus there cannot be some number less than G which will have the parts A B and C Which is the very thing it was required to show 225226ELEMENTS BOOK 8 Continued Proportion The propositions contained in Books 79 are generally attributed to the school of Pythagoras 227STOIQEIWN h ELEMENTS BOOK 8 a Proposition 1 If there are any multitude whatsoever of continuously proportional numbers and the outermost of them are prime to one another then the numbers are the least of those numbers having the same ratio as them H E A B C D F G Let A B C D be any multitude whatsoever of con tinuously proportional numbers And let the outermost of them A and D be prime to one another I say that A B C D are the least of those numbers having the same ratio as them For if not let E F G H be less than A B C D respectively being in the same ratio as them And since A B C D are in the same ratio as E F G H and the multitude of A B C D is equal to the multitude of E F G H thus via equality as A is to D so E is to H Prop 714 And A and D are prime to one another And prime numbers are also the least of those numbers having the same ratio as them Prop 721 And the least numbers measure those numbers having the same ratio as them an equal number of times the greater measuring the greater and the lesser the lesserthat is to say the leading measuring the leading and the following the following Prop 720 Thus A measures E the greater measuring the lesser The very thing is impossible Thus E F G H being less than A B C D are not in the same ratio as them Thus A B C D are the least of those numbers having the same ratio as them Which is the very thing it was required to show b Proposition 2 To nd the least numbers as many as may be pre scribed which are continuously proportional in a given ratio Let the given ratio expressed in the least numbers be that of A to B So it is required to nd the least num bers as many as may be prescribed which are in the ratio of A to B Let four numbers have been prescribed And let A make C by multiplying itself and let it make D by multiplying B And further let B make E by multiply ing itself And further let A make F G H by mul tiplying C D E And let B make K by multiplying E 228STOIQEIWN h ELEMENTS BOOK 8 K A B C D E F G H And since A has made C by multiplying itself and has made D by multiplying B thus as A is to B so C is to D Prop 717 Again since A has made D by multiplying B and B has made E by multiplying itself A B have thus made D E respectively by multiplying B Thus as A is to B so D is to E Prop 718 But as A is to B so C is to D And thus as C is to D so D is to E And since A has made F G by multiplying C D thus as C is to D so F is to G Prop 717 And as C is to D so A was to B And thus as A is to B so F is to G Again since A has made G H by multiplying D E thus as D is to E so G is to H Prop 717 But as D is to E so A is to B And thus as A is to B so G is to H And since A B have made H K by multiplying E thus as A is to B so H is to K But as A is to B so F is to G and G to H And thus as F is to G so G is to H and H to K Thus C D E and F G H K are both continu ously proportional in the ratio of A to B So I say that they are also the least sets of numbers continuously proportional in that ratio For since A and B are the least of those numbers having the same ratio as them and the least of those numbers having the same ratio are prime to one another Prop 722 A and B are thus prime to one another And A B have made C E respec tively by multiplying themselves and have made F K by multiplying C E respectively Thus C E and F K are prime to one another Prop 727 And if there are any multitude whatsoever of continuously proportional numbers and the outermost of them are prime to one another then the numbers are the least of those num bers having the same ratio as them Prop 81 Thus C D E and F G H K are the least of those continuously proportional sets of numbers having the same ratio as A and B Which is the very thing it was required to show 229STOIQEIWN h ELEMENTS BOOK 8 Pri sma Corollary So it is clear from this that if three continuously pro portional numbers are the least of those numbers hav ing the same ratio as them then the outermost of them are square and if four numbers cube g Proposition 3 If there are any multitude whatsoever of continu ously proportional numbers which are the least of those numbers having the same ratio as them then the outer most of them are prime to one another O A B C D E F G H K L M N Let A B C D be any multitude whatsoever of con tinuously proportional numbers which are the least of those numbers having the same ratio as them I say that the outermost of them A and D are prime to one another For let the two least numbers E F which are in the same ratio as A B C D have been taken Prop 733 And the three least numbers G H K Prop 82 And so on successively increasing by one until the multitude of numbers taken is made equal to the multitude of A B C D Let them have been taken and let them be L M N O And since E and F are the least of those numbers having the same ratio as them they are prime to one an other Prop 722 And since E F have made G K re spectively by multiplying themselves Prop 82 corr and have made L O by multiplying G K respec tively G K and L O are thus also prime to one another Prop 727 And since A B C D are the least of those numbers having the same ratio as them and L M N O are also the least of those numbers having the same ratio as them being in the same ratio as A B C D and the multitude of A B C D is equal to the multitude of L M N O thus A B C D are equal to L M N O respectively Thus A is equal to L and D to O And L and O are prime to one another Thus A and D are also prime to one another Which is the very thing it was 230STOIQEIWN h ELEMENTS BOOK 8 required to show d Proposition 4 For any multitude whatsoever of given ratios ex pressed in the least numbers to nd the least numbers continuously proportional in these given ratios L A C E B D F N O M P H G K Let the given ratios expressed in the least numbers be the ratios of A to B and of C to D and further of E to F So it is required to nd the least numbers continuously proportional in the ratio of A to B and of C to B and further of E to F For let the least number G measured by both B and C have be taken Prop 734 And as many times as B measures G so many times let A also measure H And as many times as C measures G so many times let D also measure K And E either measures or does not measure K Let it rst of all measure K And as many times as E measures K so many times let F also measure L And since A measures H the same number of times that B also measures G thus as A is to B so H is to G Def 720 Prop 713 And so for the same reasons as C is to D so G is to K and further as E is to F so K is to L Thus H G K L are continuously proportional in the ratio of A to B and of C to D and further of E to F So I say that they are also the least numbers con tinuously proportional in these ratios For if H G K L are not the least numbers continuously proportional in the ratios of A to B and of C to D and of E to F let N O M P be the least such numbers And since as A is to B so N is to O and A and B are the least numbers which have the same ratio as them and the least num bers measure those numbers having the same ratio as them an equal number of times the greater measur ing the greater and the lesser the lesserthat is to say the leading measuring the leading and the following the following Prop 720 B thus measures O So for the same reasons C also measures O Thus B and C both measure O Thus the least number measured by both B and C will also measure O Prop 735 And G is the least number measured by both B and C 231STOIQEIWN h ELEMENTS BOOK 8 Thus G measures O the greater measuring the lesser The very thing is impossible Thus there cannot be any numbers less than H G K L which are continuously proportional in the ratio of A to B and of C to D and further of E to F T A C E B D H G K N O M P F Q R S So let E not measure K And let the least num ber M measured by both E and K have been taken Prop 734 And as many times as K measures M so many times let H G also measure N O respectively And as many times as E measures M so many times let F also measure P Since H measures N the same num ber of times as G measures O thus as H is to G so N is to O Def 720 Prop 713 And as H is to G so A is to B And thus as A is to B so N is to O And so for the same reasons as C is to D so O is to M Again since E measures M the same num ber of times as F measures P thus as E is to F so M is to P Def 720 Prop 713 Thus N O M P are continuously proportional in the ratios of A to B and of C to D and further of E to F So I say that they are also the least numbers in the ratios of A B C D E F For if not then there will be some numbers less than N O M P which are continuously proportional in the ratios of A B C D E F Let them be Q R S T And since as Q is to R so A is to B and A and B are the least numbers having the same ratio as them and the least numbers measure those numbers hav ing the same ratio as them an equal number of times the leading measuring the leading and the following the following Prop 720 B thus measures R So for the same reasons C also measures R Thus B and C both measure R Thus the least number measured by both B and C will also measure R Prop 735 And G is the least number measured by both B and C Thus G measures R And as G is to R so K is to S Thus 232STOIQEIWN h ELEMENTS BOOK 8 K also measures S Def 720 And E also measures S Prop 720 Thus E and K both measure S Thus the least number measured by both E and K will also measure S Prop 735 And M is the least number measured by both E and K Thus M measures S the greater measuring the lesser The very thing is impos sible Thus there cannot be any numbers less than N O M P which are continuously proportional in the ratios of A to B and of C to D and further of E to F Thus N O M P are the least numbers continuously propor tional in the ratios of A B C D E F Which is the very thing it was required to show e Proposition 5 Plane numbers have to one another the ratio compoun ded out of the ratios of their sides L A B C E D F G H K Let A and B be plane numbers and let the numbers C D be the sides of A and the numbers E F the sides of B I say that A has to B the ratio compounded out of the ratios of their sides For given the ratios which C has to E and D has to F let the least numbers G H K continuously propor tional in the ratios C E D F have been taken Prop 84 so that as C is to E so G is to H and as D is to F so H is to K And let D make L by multiplying E And since D has made A by multiplying C and has made L by multiplying E thus as C is to E so A is to L Prop 717 And as C is to E so G is to H And thus as G is to H so A is to L Again since E has made L by multiplying D Prop 716 but in fact has also made B by multiplying F thus as D is to F so L is to B Prop 717 But as D is to F so H is to K And thus as H is to K so L is to B And it was also shown that as G is to H so A is to L Thus via equality as G is to K so A is to B Prop 714 And G has to K the ratio compounded out of the ratios of the sides of A and B Thus A also has to B the ratio compounded out of the ratios of the sides of A and B 233STOIQEIWN h ELEMENTS BOOK 8 Which is the very thing it was required to show ie multiplied Proposition 6 If there are any multitude whatsoever of continuously proportional numbers and the rst does not measure the second then no other number will measure any other number either E F G H A B C D Let A B C D E be any multitude whatsoever of continuously proportional numbers and let A not mea sure B I say that no other number will measure any other number either Now it is clear that A B C D E do not succes sively measure one another For A does not even mea sure B So I say that no other number will measure any other number either For if possible let A measure C And as many numbers as are A B C let so many of the least numbers F G H have been taken of those numbers having the same ratio as A B C Prop 733 And since F G H are in the same ratio as A B C and the multitude of A B C is equal to the multitude of F G H thus via equality as A is to C so F is to H Prop 714 And since as A is to B so F is to G and A does not measure B F does not measure G either Def 720 Thus F is not a unit For a unit measures all numbers And F and H are prime to one another Prop 83 and thus F does not measure H And as F is to H so A is to C And thus A does not measure C either Def 720 So similarly we can show that no other number can measure any other number either Which is the very thing it was required to show z Proposition 7 If there are any multitude whatsoever of continu ously proportional numbers and the rst measures the 234STOIQEIWN h ELEMENTS BOOK 8 last then the rst will also measure the second D A B C Let A B C D be any number whatsoever of continu ously proportional numbers And let A measure D I say that A also measures B For if A does not measure B then no other number will measure any other number either Prop 86 But A measures D Thus A also measures B Which is the very thing it was required to show h Proposition 8 If between two numbers there fall some numbers in continued proportion then as many numbers as fall in between them in continued proportion so many num bers will also fall in between any two numbers having the same ratio as them in continued proportion F G K L H A C D B E M N For let the numbers C and D fall between two num bers A and B in continued proportion and let it have been contrived that as A is to B so E is to F I say that as many numbers as have fallen in between A and B in continued proportion so many numbers will also fall in between E and F in continued proportion For as many as A B C D are in multitude let so many of the least numbers G H K L having the same ratio as A B C D have been taken Prop 733 Thus the outermost of them G and L are prime to one another Prop 83 And since A B C D are in the same ratio as G H K L and the multitude of A B C D is equal to the multitude of G H K L thus via equality as A is to B so G is to L Prop 714 And as A is to B so 235STOIQEIWN h ELEMENTS BOOK 8 E is to F And thus as G is to L so E is to F And G and L are prime to one another And numbers prime to one another are also the least numbers hav ing the same ratio as them Prop 721 And the least numbers measure those numbers having the same ratio as them an equal number of times the greater measur ing the greater and the lesser the lesserthat is to say the leading measuring the leading and the following the following Prop 720 Thus G measures E the same number of times as L measures F So as many times as G measures E so many times let H K also measure M N respectively Thus G H K L measure E M N F respectively an equal number of times Thus G H K L are in the same ratio as E M N F Def 720 But G H K L are in the same ratio as A C D B Thus A C D B are also in the same ratio as E M N F And A C D B are continuously proportional Thus E M N F are also continuously proportional Thus as many numbers as have fallen in between A and B in continued proportion so many numbers have also fallen in between E and F in continued proportion Which is the very thing it was required to show j Proposition 9 If two numbers are prime to one another and there fall in between them some numbers in continued pro portion then as many numbers as fall in between them in continued proportion so many numbers will also fall between each of them and a unit in continued proportion G A C D B H K L M N O P E F Let A and B be two numbers which are prime to one another and let the numbers C and D fall in be tween them in continued proportion And let the unit E be set out I say that as many numbers as have fallen in between A and B in continued proportion so many numbers will also fall between each of A and B and the unit in continued proportion For let the least two numbers F and G which are in the ratio of A C D B have been taken Prop 733 236STOIQEIWN h ELEMENTS BOOK 8 And the least three numbers H K L And so on successively increasing by one until the multitude of the least numbers taken is made equal to the multitude of A C D B Prop 82 Let them have been taken and let them be M N O P So it is clear that F has made H by multiplying itself and has made M by multi plying H And G has made L by multiplying itself and has made P by multiplying L Prop 82 corr And since M N O P are the least of those numbers hav ing the same ratio as F G and A C D B are also the least of those numbers having the same ratio as F G Prop 82 and the multitude of M N O P is equal to the multitude of A C D B thus M N O P are equal to A C D B respectively Thus M is equal to A and P to B And since F has made H by multiply ing itself F thus measures H according to the units in F Def 715 And the unit E also measures F according to the units in it Thus the unit E measures the number F as many times as F measures H Thus as the unit E is to the number F so F is to H Def 720 Again since F has made M by multiplying H H thus measures M according to the units in F Def 715 And the unit E also measures the number F according to the units in it Thus the unit E measures the number F as many times as H measures M Thus as the unit E is to the number F so H is to M Prop 720 And it was shown that as the unit E is to the number F so F is to H And thus as the unit E is to the number F so F is to H and H is to M And M is equal to A Thus as the unit E is to the number F so F is to H and H to A And so for the same reasons as the unit E is to the number G so G is to L and L to B Thus as many numbers as have fallen in between A and B in continued proportion so many numbers have also fallen between each of A and B and the unit E in continued proportion Which is the very thing it was required to show i Proposition 10 If some numbers fall between each of two numbers and a unit in continued proportion then as many num bers as fall between each of the two numbers and the unit in continued proportion so many numbers will also fall in between the two numbers themselves in con tinued proportion For let the numbers D E and F G fall between the numbers A and B respectively and the unit C in con tinued proportion I say that as many numbers as have fallen between each of A and B and the unit C in contin ued proportion so many will also fall in between A and B in continued proportion 237STOIQEIWN h ELEMENTS BOOK 8 L C C D E A B G F H K For let D make H by multiplying F And let D F make K L respectively by multiplying H As since as the unit C is to the number D so D is to E the unit C thus measures the number D as many times as D measures E Def 720 And the unit C measures the number D according to the units in D Thus the number D also measures E according to the units in D Thus D has made E by multiplying itself Again since as the unit C is to the number D so E is to A the unit C thus measures the number D as many times as E measures A Def 720 And the unit C measures the number D according to the units in D Thus E also mea sures A according to the units in D Thus D has made A by multiplying E And so for the same reasons F has made G by multiplying itself and has made B by multiplying G And since D has made E by multiplying itself and has made H by multiplying F thus as D is to F so E is to H Prop 717 And so for the same rea sons as D is to F so H is to G Prop 718 And thus as E is to H so H is to G Again since D has made A K by multiplying E H respectively thus as E is to H so A is to K Prop 717 But as E is to H so D is to F And thus as D is to F so A is to K Again since D F have made K L respectively by multiply ing H thus as D is to F so K is to L Prop 718 But as D is to F so A is to K And thus as A is to K so K is to L Further since F has made L B by mul tiplying H G respectively thus as H is to G so L is to B Prop 717 And as H is to G so D is to F And thus as D is to F so L is to B And it was also shown that as D is to F so A is to K and K to L And thus as A is to K so K is to L and L to B Thus A K L B are successively in continued proportion Thus as many numbers as fall between each of A and B and the unit C in continued proportion so many will also fall in between A and B in continued proportion Which is the very thing it was required to show 238STOIQEIWN h ELEMENTS BOOK 8 ia Proposition 11 There exists one number in mean proportion to two given square numbers And one square number has to the other square number a squared ratio with respect to that the side of the former has to the side of the latter D A B C E Let A and B be square numbers and let C be the side of A and D the side of B I say that there exists one number in mean proportion to A and B and that A has to B a squared ratio with respect to that C has to D For let C make E by multiplying D And since A is square and C is its side C has thus made A by multi plying itself And so for the same reasons D has made B by multiplying itself Therefore since C has made A E by multiplying C D respectively thus as C is to D so A is to E Prop 717 And so for the same rea sons as C is to D so E is to B Prop 718 And thus as A is to E so E is to B Thus one number namely E is in mean proportion to A and B So I say that A also has to B a squared ratio with respect to that C has to D For since A E B are three continuously proportional numbers A thus has to B a squared ratio with respect to that A has to E Def 59 And as A is to E so C is to D Thus A has to B a squared ratio with respect to that side C has to side D Which is the very thing it was required to show In other words between two given square numbers there exists a number in continued proportion Literally double ib Proposition 12 There exist two numbers in mean proportion to two given cube numbers And one cube number has to the other cube number a cubed ratio with respect to that the side of the former has to the side of the latter Let A and B be cube numbers and let C be the side of A and D the side of B I say that there exist two numbers in mean proportion to A and B and that A has 239STOIQEIWN h ELEMENTS BOOK 8 to B a cubed ratio with respect to that C has to D K A B C D E F G H For let C make E by multiplying itself and let it make F by multiplying D And let D make G by mul tiplying itself and let C D make H K respectively by multiplying F And since A is cube and C is its side and C has made E by multiplying itself C has thus made E by multiplying itself and has made A by multiplying E And so for the same reasons D has made G by mul tiplying itself and has made B by multiplying G And since C has made E F by multiplying C D respec tively thus as C is to D so E is to F Prop 717 And so for the same reasons as C is to D so F is to G Prop 718 Again since C has made A H by multi plying E F respectively thus as E is to F so A is to H Prop 717 And as E is to F so C is to D And thus as C is to D so A is to H Again since C D have made H K respectively by multiplying F thus as C is to D so H is to K Prop 718 Again since D has made K B by multiplying F G respectively thus as F is to G so K is to B Prop 717 And as F is to G so C is to D And thus as C is to D so A is to H and H to K and K to B Thus H and K are two numbers in mean proportion to A and B So I say that A also has to B a cubed ratio with re spect to that C has to D For since A H K B are four continuously proportional numbers A thus has to B a cubed ratio with respect to that A has to H Def 510 And as A is to H so C is to D And thus A has to B a cubed ratio with respect to that C has to D Which is the very thing it was required to show In other words between two given cube numbers there exist two numbers in continued proportion Literally triple ig Proposition 13 If there are any multitude whatsoever of continuously proportional numbers and each makes some number by multiplying itself then the numbers created from them will also be continuously proportional And if the original numbers make some more numbers by multiplying the created numbers then these will also 240STOIQEIWN h ELEMENTS BOOK 8 be continuously proportional and this always happens with the extremes Let A B C be any multitude whatsoever of contin uously proportional numbers such that as A is to B so B is to C And let A B C make D E F by multiplying themselves and let them make G H K by multiplying D E F I say that D E F and G H K are continuously proportional P A B C D E F G H K L O M N Q For let A make L by multiplying B And let A B make M N respectively by multiplying L And again let B make O by multiplying C And let B C make P Q respectively by multplying O So similarly to the above we can show that D L E and G M N H are continuously proportional in the ratio of A to B and further that E O F and H P Q K are continuously proportional in the ratio of B to C And as A is to B so B is to C And thus D L E are in the same ratio as E O F and further G M N H are in the same ratio as H P Q K And the multitude of D L E is equal to the multitude of E O F and that of G M N H to that of H P Q K Thus via equality as D is to E so E is to F and as G is to H so H is to K Prop 714 Which is the very thing it was required to show id Proposition 14 If a square number measures another square number then the side of the former will also mea sure the side of the latter And if the side of a square number measures the side of another square number then the former square number will also measure the latter square number Let A and B be square numbers and let C and D be their sides respectively And let A measure B I say that C also measures D 241STOIQEIWN h ELEMENTS BOOK 8 D A B E C For let C make E by multiplying D Thus A E B are continuously proportional in the ratio of C to D Prop 811 And since A E B are continuously pro portional and A measures B A thus also measures E Prop 87 And as A is to E so C is to D Thus C also measures D Def 720 So again let C measure D I say that A also measures B For similarly with the same construction we can show that A E B are continuously proportional in the ratio of C to D And since as C is to D so A is to E and C measures D A thus also measures E Def 720 And A E B are continuously proportional Thus A also measures B Thus if a square number measures another square number then the side of the former will also measure the side of the latter And if the side of a square num ber measures the side of another square number then the former square number will also measure the lat ter square number Which is the very thing it was required to show ie Proposition 15 If a cube number measures another cube number then the side of the former will also measure the side of the latter And if the side of a cube number mea sures the side of another cube number then the for mer cube number will also measure the latter cube number For let the cube number A measure the cube num ber B and let C be the side of A and D the side of B I say that C measures D D A B E G F H K C For let C make E by multiplying itself And let 242STOIQEIWN h ELEMENTS BOOK 8 D make G by multiplying itself And further let C make F by multiplying D and let C D make H K respectively by multiplying F So it is clear that E F G and A H K B are continuously proportional in the ratio of C to D Prop 812 And since A H K B are continuously proportional and A measures B A thus also measures H Prop 87 And as A is to H so C is to D Thus C also measures D Def 720 And so let C measure D I say that A will also mea sure B For similarly with the same construction we can show that A H K B are continuously proportional in the ratio of C to D And since C measures D and as C is to D so A is to H A thus also measures H Def 720 Hence A also measures B Which is the very thing it was required to show i Proposition 16 If a square number does not measure another square number then the side of the former will not measure the side of the latter either And if the side of a square number does not measure the side of another square number then the former square number will not measure the latter square number either A B C D Let A and B be square numbers and let C and D be their sides respectively And let A not measure B I say that C does not measure D either For if C measures D then A will also measure B Prop 814 And A does not measure B Thus C will not measure D either So again let C not measure D I say that A will not measure B either For if A measures B then C will also measure D Prop 814 And C does not measure D Thus A will not measure B either Which is the very thing it was required to show iz Proposition 17 If a cube number does not measure another cube number then the side of the former will not measure the side of the latter either And if the side of a cube num ber does not measure the side of another cube number then the former cube number will not measure the latter cube number either 243STOIQEIWN h ELEMENTS BOOK 8 A B C D For let the cube number A not measure the cube num ber B And let C be the side of A and D the side of B I say that C will not measure D For if C measures D then A will also measure B Prop 815 And A does not measure B Thus C does not measure D either And so let C not measure D I say that A will not measure B either For if A measures B then C will also measure D Prop 815 And C does not measure D Thus A will not measure B either Which is the very thing it was required to show ih Proposition 18 There exists one number in mean proportion to two similar plane numbers And one plane number has to the other plane number a squared ratio with respect to that a corresponding side of the former has to a corresponding side of the latter E A C G D B F Let A and B be two similar plane numbers And let the numbers C D be the sides of A and E F the sides of B And since similar numbers are those having pro portional sides Def 721 thus as C is to D so E is to F Therefore I say that there exists one number in mean proportion to A and B and that A has to B a squared ratio with respect to that C has to E or D to Fthat is to say with respect to that a corresponding side has to a corresponding side For since as C is to D so E is to F thus alternately as C is to E so D is to F Prop 713 And since A is plane and C D its sides D has thus made A by mul tiplying C And so for the same reasons E has made B by multiplying F So let D make G by multiplying E And since D has made A by multiplying C and has made G by multiplying E thus as C is to E so A is to G Prop 717 But as C is to E so D is to F And thus as D is to F so A is to G Again since E has made G by multiplying D and has made B by multi plying F thus as D is to F so G is to B Prop 717 And it was also shown that as D is to F so A is to G And thus as A is to G so G is to B Thus A G B are 244STOIQEIWN h ELEMENTS BOOK 8 continously proportional Thus there exists one number namely G in mean proportion to A and B So I say that A also has to B a squared ratio with respect to that a corresponding side has to a corre sponding sidethat is to say with respect to that C has to E or D to F For since A G B are continuously proportional A has to B a squared ratio with respect to that A has to G Prop 59 And as A is to G so C is to E and D to F And thus A has to B a squared ratio with respect to that C has to E or D to F Which is the very thing it was required to show Literally double ij Proposition 19 Two numbers fall between two similar solid num bers in mean proportion And a solid number has to a similar solid number a cubed ratio with respect to that a corresponding side has to a corresponding side O A B K M L D E F G H C N Let A and B be two similar solid numbers and let C D E be the sides of A and F G H the sides of B And since similar solid numbers are those having proportional sides Def 721 thus as C is to D so F is to G and as D is to E so G is to H I say that two numbers fall between A and B in mean proportion and that A has to B a cubed ratio with respect to that C has to F and D to G and further E to H For let C make K by multiplying D and let F make L by multiplying G And since C D are in the same ratio as F G and K is the number created from mul tiplying C D and L the number created from multi plying F G thus K and L are similar plane numbers Def 721 Thus there exits one number in mean pro portion to K and L Prop 818 Let it be M Thus M is the number created from multiplying D F as shown in the theorem before this one And since D has made K by multiplying C and has made M by multiplying F thus as C is to F so K is to M Prop 717 But as 245STOIQEIWN h ELEMENTS BOOK 8 K is to M so M is to L Thus K M L are contin uously proportional in the ratio of C to F And since as C is to D so F is to G thus alternately as C is to F so D is to G Prop 713 And so for the same reasons as D is to G so E is to H Thus K M L are contin uously proportional in the ratio of C to F and of D to G and further of E to H So let E H make N O respec tively by multiplying M And since A is solid and C D E are its sides E has thus made A by multiplying the number created from multiplying C D And K is the number created from multiplying C D Thus E has made A by multiplying K And so for the same reasons H has made B by multiplying L And since E has made A by multiplying K but has in fact also made N by multiplying M thus as K is to M so A is to N Prop 717 And as K is to M so C is to F and D to G and further E to H And thus as C is to F and D to G and E to H so A is to N Again since E H have made N O respectively by multiplying M thus as E is to H so N is to O Prop 718 But as E is to H so C is to F and D to G And thus as C is to F and D to G and E to H so is A to N and N to O Again since H has made O by multiplying M but has in fact also made B by multiplying L thus as M is to L so O is to B Prop 717 But as M is to L so C is to F and D to G and E to H And thus as C is to F and D to G and E to H so not only is O to B but also A to N and N to O Thus A N O B are continuously proportional in the aforementioned ratios of the sides So I say that A also has to B a cubed ratio with respect to that a corresponding side has to a corresponding sidethat is to say with respect to that the number C has to F or D to G and further E to H For since A N O B are four continuously proportional numbers A thus has to B a cubed ratio with respect to that A has to N Def 510 But as A is to N so it was shown is C to F and D to G and further E to H And thus A has to B a cubed ratio with respect to that a corresponding side has to a corresponding sidethat is to say with respect to that the number C has to F and D to G and further E to H Which is the very thing it was required to show Literally triple k Proposition 20 If one number falls between two numbers in mean proportion then the numbers will be similar plane num 246STOIQEIWN h ELEMENTS BOOK 8 bers For let one number C fall between the two numbers A and B in mean proportion I say that A and B are similar plane numbers G A C B D F E For let the least numbers D and E having the same ratio as A and C have been taken Prop 733 Thus D measures A as many times as E measures C Prop 720 So as many times as D measures A so many units let there be in F Thus F has made A by multiplying D Def 715 Hence A is plane and D F are its sides Again since D and E are the least of those numbers having the same ratio as C and B D thus measures C as many times as E measures B Prop 720 So as many times as E measures B so many units let there be in G Thus E measures B ac cording to the units in G Thus G has made B by mul tiplying E Def 715 Thus B is plane and E G are its sides Thus A and B are both plane numbers So I say that they are also similar For since F has made A by multiplying D and has made C by multiplying E thus as D is to E so A is to Cthat is to say C to B Prop 717 Again since E has made C B by multi plying F G respectively thus as F is to G so C is to B Prop 717 And as C is to B so D is to E And thus as D is to E so F is to G And alternately as D is to F so E is to G Prop 713 Thus A and B are similar plane numbers For their sides are proportional Def 721 Which is the very thing it was required to show This part of the proof is defective since it is not demonstrated that F E C Furthermore it is not necessary to show that D E A C because this is true by hypothesis ka Proposition 21 If two numbers fall between two numbers in mean proportion then the latter are similar solid numbers For let the two numbers C and D fall between the two numbers A and B in mean proportion I say that A and B are similar solid numbers For let the three least numbers E F G having the same ratio as A C D have been taken Prop 82 Thus the outermost of them E and G are prime to one an other Prop 83 And since one number F has fallen between E and G in mean proportion E and G are 247STOIQEIWN h ELEMENTS BOOK 8 thus similar plane numbers Prop 820 Therefore let H K be the sides of E and L M the sides of G Thus it is clear from the proposition before this one that E F G are continuously proportional in the ratio of H to L and of K to M And since E F G are the least num bers having the same ratio as A C D and the multitude of E F G is equal to the multitude of A C D thus via equality as E is to G so A is to D Prop 714 And E and G are prime to one another and prime numbers are also the least of those numbers having the same ratio as them Prop 721 and the least num bers measure those numbers having the same ratio as them an equal number of times the greater measuring the greater and the lesser the lesserthat is to say the leading measuring the leading and the following the following Prop 720 Thus E measures A the same number of times as G measures D So as many times as E measures A so many units let there be in N Thus N has made A by multiplying E Def 715 And E is the number created from multiplying H and K Thus N has made A by multiplying the number created from multiplying H and K Thus A is solid and its sides are H K N Again since E F G are the least numbers having the same ratio as C D B thus E measures C the same number of times as G measures B Prop 720 So as many times as E measures C so many units let there be in O Thus G measures B according to the units in O Thus O has made B by multiplying G And G is the number created from multiplying L and M Thus O has made B by multiplying the number cre ated from multiplying L and M Thus B is solid and its sides are L M O Thus A and B are both solid H A C D B E F G L M O N K So I say that they are also similar For since N O have made A C by multiplying E thus as N is to O so A is to Cthat is to say E to F Prop 718 But as E is to F so H is to L and K to M And thus as H is to L so K is to M and N to O And H K N are the sides of A and L M O the sides of B Thus A and 248STOIQEIWN h ELEMENTS BOOK 8 B are similar solid numbers Def 721 Which is the very thing it was required to show The Greek text has O L M which is obviously a mistake kb Proposition 22 If three numbers are continuously proportional and the rst is square then the third will also be square C A B Let A B C be three continuously proportional num bers and let the rst A be square I say that the third C is also square For since one number B is in mean proportion to A and C A and C are thus similar plane numbers Prop 820 And A is square Thus C is also square Def 721 Which is the very thing it was required to show kg Proposition 23 If four numbers are continuously proportional and the rst is cube then the fourth will also be cube A B C D Let A B C D be four continuously proportional numbers and let A be cube I say that D is also cube For since two numbers B and C are in mean propor tion to A and D A and D are thus similar solid numbers Prop 821 And A is cube Thus D is also cube Def 721 Which is the very thing it was required to show kd Proposition 24 If two numbers have to one another the ratio which a square number has to another square number and the rst is square then the second will also be square D A B C For let two numbers A and B have to one another 249STOIQEIWN h ELEMENTS BOOK 8 the ratio which the square number C has to the square number D And let A be square I say that B is also square For since C and D are square C and D are thus sim ilar plane numbers Thus one number falls between C and D in mean proportion Prop 818 And as C is to D so A is to B Thus one number also falls be tween A and B in mean proportion Prop 88 And A is square Thus B is also square Prop 822 Which is the very thing it was required to show ke Proposition 25 If two numbers have to one another the ratio which a cube number has to another cube number and the rst is cube then the second will also be cube D A E F B C For let two numbers A and B have to one another the ratio which the cube number C has to the cube number D And let A be cube So I say that B is also cube For since C and D are cube numbers C and D are thus similar solid numbers Thus two numbers fall between C and D in mean proportion Prop 819 And as many numbers as fall in between C and D in continued proportion so many also fall in between those numbers having the same ratio as them in con tinued proportion Prop 88 And hence two numbers fall between A and B in mean proportion Let E and F so fall Therefore since the four numbers A E F B are continuously proportional and A is cube B is thus also cube Prop 823 Which is the very thing it was required to show k Proposition 26 Similar plane numbers have to one another the ratio which some square number has to another square number F A C B D E Let A and B be similar plane numbers I say that A has to B the ratio which some square number has to 250STOIQEIWN h ELEMENTS BOOK 8 another square number For since A and B are similar plane numbers one number thus falls between A and B in mean propor tion Prop 818 Let it so fall and let it be C And let the least numbers D E F having the same ratio as A C B have been taken Prop 82 The outermost of them D and F are thus square Prop 82 corr And since as D is to F so A is to B and D and F are square A thus has to B the ratio which some square number has to another square number Which is the very thing it was required to show kz Proposition 27 Similar

G H having the same ratio as A C D B and equal in multitude to them have been taken Prop 82 Thus the outermost of them E and H are cube Prop 82 corr And as E is to H so A is to B And thus A has to B the ratio which some cube number has to another cube number Which is the very thing it was required to show 251252ELEMENTS BOOK 9 Applications of Number Theory The propositions contained in Books 79 are generally attributed to the school of Pythagoras 253STOIQEIWN j ELEMENTS BOOK 9 a Proposition 1 If two similar plane numbers make some number by multiplying one another then the created number will be square D A B C Let A and B be two similar plane numbers and let A make C by multiplying B I say that C is square For let A make D by multiplying itself D is thus square Therefore since A has made D by multiply ing itself and has made C by multiplying B thus as A is to B so D is to C Prop 717 And since A and B are similar plane numbers one number thus falls be tween A and B in mean proportion Prop 818 And if some numbers fall between two numbers in continued proportion then as many numbers as fall in between them in continued proportion so many also fall in between numbers having the same ratio as them in continued proportion Prop 88 And hence one num ber falls between D and C in mean proportion And D is square Thus C is also square Prop 822 Which is the very thing it was required to show b Proposition 2 If two numbers make a square number by multiply ing one another then they are similar plane numbers D A B C Let A and B be two numbers and let A make the square number C by multiplying B I say that A and B are similar plane numbers For let A make D by multiplying itself Thus D is square And since A has made D by multiplying itself and has made C by multiplying B thus as A is to B so D is to C Prop 717 And since D is square and C is also D and C are thus similar plane numbers Thus one number falls between D and C in mean propor 254STOIQEIWN j ELEMENTS BOOK 9 tion Prop 818 And as D is to C so A is to B Thus one number also falls between A and B in mean pro portion Prop 88 And if one number falls between two numbers in mean proportion then the numbers are similar plane numbers Prop 820 Thus A and B are similar plane numbers Which is the very thing it was required to show g Proposition 3 If a cube number makes some number by multiply ing itself then the created number will be cube D A B C For let the cube number A make B by multiplying itself I say that B is cube For let the side C of A have been taken And let C make D by multiplying itself So it is clear that C has made A by multiplying D And since C has made D by multiplying itself C thus measures D according to the units in it Def 715 But in fact a unit also mea sures C according to the units in it Def 720 Thus as a unit is to C so C is to D Again since C has made A by multiplying D D thus measures A according to the units in C And a unit also measures C according to the units in it Thus as a unit is to C so D is to A But as a unit is to C so C is to D And thus as a unit is to C so C is to D and D to A Thus two numbers C and D have fallen between a unit and the number A in continued mean proportion Again since A has made B by multiplying itself A thus measures B according to the units in it And a unit also measures A according to the units in it Thus as a unit is to A so A is to B And two numbers have fallen between a unit and A in mean proportion Thus two numbers will also fall be tween A and B in mean proportion Prop 88 And if two numbers fall between two numbers in mean pro portion and the rst number is cube then the second will also be cube Prop 823 And A is cube Thus B is also cube Which is the very thing it was required to show d Proposition 4 If a cube number makes some number by multiply ing another cube number then the created number 255STOIQEIWN j ELEMENTS BOOK 9 will be cube D A B C For let the cube number A make C by multiplying the cube number B I say that C is cube For let A make D by multiplying itself Thus D is cube Prop 93 And since A has made D by multi plying itself and has made C by multiplying B thus as A is to B so D is to C Prop 717 And since A and B are cube A and B are similar solid numbers Thus two numbers fall between A and B in mean pro portion Prop 819 Hence two numbers will also fall between D and C in mean proportion Prop 88 And D is cube Thus C is also cube Prop 823 Which is the very thing it was required to show e Proposition 5 If a cube number makes another cube number by multiplying some number then the number multi plied will also be cube C A B D For let the cube number A make the cube number C by multiplying some number B I say that B is cube For let A make D by multiplying itself D is thus cube Prop 93 And since A has made D by multiply ing itself and has made C by multiplying B thus as A is to B so D is to C Prop 717 And since D and C are both cube they are similar solid numbers Thus two numbers fall between D and C in mean proportion Prop 819 And as D is to C so A is to B Thus two numbers also fall between A and B in mean pro portion Prop 88 And A is cube Thus B is also cube Prop 823 Which is the very thing it was required to show Proposition 6 If a number makes a cube number by multiplying 256STOIQEIWN j ELEMENTS BOOK 9 itself then it itself will also be cube C A B For let the number A make the cube number B by multiplying itself I say that A is also cube For let A make C by multiplying B Therefore since A has made B by multiplying itself and has made C by multiplying B C is thus cube And since A has made B by multiplying itself A thus measures B according to the units in A And a unit also measures A according to the units in it Thus as a unit is to A so A is to B And since A has made C by multiplying B B thus measures C according to the units in A And a unit also measures A according to the units in it Thus as a unit is to A so B is to C But as a unit is to A so A is to B And thus as A is to B so B is to C And since B and C are cube they are similar solid numbers Thus there exist two numbers in mean proportion between B and C Prop 819 And as B is to C so A is to B Thus there also exist two numbers in mean proportion between A and B Prop 88 And B is cube Thus A is also cube Prop 823 Which is the very thing it was required to show z Proposition 7 If a composite number makes some number by mul tiplying some other number then the created number will be solid E A B C D For let the composite number A make C by multi plying some number B I say that C is solid For since A is a composite number it will be mea sured by some number Let it be measured by D And as many times as D measures A so many units let there be in E Therefore since D measures A according to the units in E E has thus made A by multiplying D Def 715 And since A has made C by multiplying B and A is the number created from multiplying D E the number created from multiplying D E has thus 257STOIQEIWN j ELEMENTS BOOK 9 made C by multiplying B Thus C is solid and its sides are D E B Which is the very thing it was required to show h Proposition 8 If any multitude whatsoever of numbers is continu ously proportional starting from a unit then the third from the unit will be square and all those numbers after that which leave an interval of one number and the fourth will be cube and all those numbers after that which leave an interval of two numbers and the seventh will be both cube and square and all those numbers after that which leave an interval of ve num bers F A B C D E Let any multitude whatsoever of numbers A B C D E F be continuously proportional starting from a unit I say that the third from the unit B is square and all those numbers after that which leave an inter val of one number And the fourth from the unit C is cube and all those numbers after that which leave an interval of two numbers And the seventh from the unit F is both cube and square and all those num bers after that which leave an interval of ve numbers For since as the unit is to A so A is to B the unit thus measures the number A the same number of times as A measures B Def 720 And the unit measures the number A according to the units in it Thus A also measures B according to the units in A A has thus made B by multiplying itself Def 715 Thus B is square And since B C D are continuously proportional and B is square D is thus also square Prop 822 So for the same reasons F is also square So similarly we can also show that all those numbers after that which leave an interval of one number are square So I also say that the fourth number from the unit C is cube and all those numbers after that which leave an interval of two numbers For since as the unit is to A so B is to C the unit thus measures the number A the same number of times that B measures C And the unit measures the 258STOIQEIWN j ELEMENTS BOOK 9 number A according to the units in A And thus B mea sures C according to the units in A A has thus made C by multiplying B Therefore since A has made B by multiplying itself and has made C by multiplying B C is thus cube And since C D E F are continuously pro portional and C is cube F is thus also cube Prop 823 And it was also shown to be square Thus the seventh number from the unit is both cube and square So similarly we can show that all those numbers after that which leave an interval of ve numbers are both cube and square Which is the very thing it was required to show j Proposition 9 If any multitude whatsoever of numbers is continu ously proportional starting from a unit and the num ber after the unit is square then all the remaining num bers will also be square And if the number after the unit is cube then all the remaining numbers will also be cube F A B C D E Let any multitude whatsoever of numbers A B C D E F be continuously proportional starting from a unit And let the number after the unit A be square I say that all the remaining numbers will also be square In fact it has already been shown that the third number from the unit B is square and all those num bers after that which leave an interval of one number Prop 98 So I say that all the remaining num bers are also square For since A B C are continu ously proportional and A is square C is thus also square Prop 822 Again since B C D are also con tinuously proportional and B is square D is thus also square Prop 822 So similarly we can show that all the remaining numbers are also square And so let A be cube I say that all the remaining numbers are also cube In fact it has already been shown that the fourth number from the unit C is cube and all those num bers after that which leave an interval of two numbers 259STOIQEIWN j ELEMENTS BOOK 9 Prop 98 So I say that all the remaining numbers are also cube For since as the unit is to A so A is to B the unit thus measures A the same number of times as A measures B And the unit measures A according to the units in it Thus A also measures B according to the units in A A has thus made B by multiplying it self And A is cube And if a cube number makes some number by multiplying itself then the created number is cube Prop 93 Thus B is also cube And since the four numbers A B C D are continuously proportional and A is cube D is thus also cube Prop 823 So for the same reasons E is also cube and similarly all the remaining numbers are cube Which is the very thing it was required to show i Proposition 10 If any multitude whatsoever of numbers is continu ously proportional starting from a unit and the num ber after the unit is not square then no other number will be square either apart from the third from the unit and all those numbers after that which leave an inter val of one number And if the number after the unit is not cube then no other number will be cube either apart from the fourth from the unit and all those num bers after that which leave an interval of two numbers F A B C D E Let any multitude whatsoever of numbers A B C D E F be continuously proportional starting from a unit And let the number after the unit A not be square I say that no other number will be square ei ther apart from the third from the unit and all those numbers after that which leave an interval of one num ber For if possible let C be square And B is also square Prop 98 Thus B and C have to one another the ratio which some square number has to some other square number And as B is to C so A is to B Thus A and B have to one another the ratio which some square number has to some other square number Hence A and B are similar plane numbers 260STOIQEIWN j ELEMENTS BOOK 9 Prop 826 And B is square Thus A is also square The very opposite thing was assumed C is thus not square So similarly we can show that no other number is square either apart from the third from the unit and all those numbers after that which leave an interval of one number And so let A not be cube I say that no other num ber will be cube either apart from the fourth from the unit and all those numbers after that which leave an interval of two numbers For if possible let D be cube And C is also cube Prop 98 For it is the fourth number from the unit And as C is to D so B is to C And B thus has to C the ratio which some cube number has to some other cube number And C is cube Thus B is also cube Props 713 825 And since as the unit is to A so A is to B and the unit measures A accord ing to the units in it A thus also measures B according to the units in A Thus A has made the cube num ber B by multiplying itself And if a number makes a cube number by multiplying itself then it itself will be cube Prop 96 Thus A is also cube The very oppo site thing was assumed Thus D is not cube So simi larly we can show that no other number is cube either apart from the fourth from the unit and all those num bers after that which leave an interval of two numbers Which is the very thing it was required to show ia Proposition 11 If any multitude whatsoever of numbers is continu ously proportional starting from a unit then a lesser number measures a greater according to some existing number among the proportional numbers E A B C D Let any multitude whatsoever of numbers B C D E be continuously proportional starting from the unit A I say that for B C D E the least number B measures E according to some one of C D For since as the unit A is to B so D is to E the unit A thus measures the number B the same number of times as D measures E Thus alternately the unit A 261STOIQEIWN j ELEMENTS BOOK 9 measures D the same number of times as B measures E Prop 715 And the unit A measures D according to the units in it Thus B also measures E according to the units in D Hence the lesser number B measures the greater E according to some existing number among the proportional numbers namely D Pri sma Corollary And it is clear that whatever relative place the measuring number has from the unit the number according to which it measures has the same relative place from the measured number in the direction of the number before it Which is the very thing it was required to show ib Proposition 12 If any multitude whatsoever of numbers is continu ously proportional starting from a unit then however many prime numbers the last number is measured by the number next to the unit will also be measured by the same prime numbers C A B D E F G H Let any multitude whatsoever of numbers A B C D be continuously proportional starting from a unit I say that however many prime numbers D is measured by A will also be measured by the same prime numbers For let D be measured by some prime number E I say that E measures A For suppose it does not E is prime and every prime number is prime to every num ber which it does not measure Prop 729 Thus E and A are prime to one another And since E measures D let it measure it according to F Thus E has made D by multiplying F Again since A measures D ac cording to the units in C Prop 911 corr A has thus made D by multiplying C But in fact E has also made D by multiplying F Thus the number cre ated from multiplying A C is equal to the number created from multiplying E F Thus as A is to E so F is to C Prop 719 And A and E are prime to one another and numbers prime to one another are also the least of those numbers having the same ra tio as them Prop 721 and the least numbers mea sure those numbers having the same ratio as them an equal number of times the leading measuring the lead 262STOIQEIWN j ELEMENTS BOOK 9 ing and the following the following Prop 720 Thus E measures C Let it measure it according to G Thus E has made C by multiplying G But in fact via the proposition before this A has also made C by multi plying B Prop 911 corr Thus the number created from multiplying A B is equal to the number created from multiplying E G Thus as A is to E so G is to B Prop 719 And A and E are prime to one another and numbers prime to one another are also the least of those numbers having the same ratio as them Prop 721 and the least numbers measure those numbers having the same ratio as them an equal number of times the leading measuring the leading and the following the following Prop 720 Thus E measures B Let it measure it according to H Thus E has made B by multiplying H But in fact A has also made B by multiplying itself Prop 98 Thus the number created from multiplying E H is equal to the square on A Thus as E is to A so A is to H Prop 719 And A and E are prime to one an other and numbers prime to one another are also the least of those numbers having the same ratio as them Prop 721 and the least numbers measure those numbers having the same ratio as them an equal number of times the leading measuring the leading and the following the following Prop 720 Thus E measures A as the leading measuring the leading But in fact E also does not measure A The very thing is impossible Thus E and A are not prime to one another Thus they are composite to one another And numbers composite to one another are both measured by some prime number Def 714 And since E is assumed to be prime and a prime number is not measured by another number other than itself Def 711 E thus measures both A and E Hence E measures A And it also measures D Thus E measures both A and D So similarly we can show that however many prime numbers D is measured by A will also be measured by the same prime numbers Which is the very thing it was required to show ig Proposition 13 If any multitude whatsoever of numbers is continu ously proportional starting from a unit and the num ber after the unit is prime then the greatest number will be measured by no other numbers except num bers existing among the proportional numbers Let any multitude whatsoever of numbers A B C D be continuously proportional starting from a unit And let the number after the unit A be prime I say 263STOIQEIWN j ELEMENTS BOOK 9 that the greatest of them D will be measured by no other numbers except A B C E A B C D H G F For if possible let it be measured by E and let E not be the same as one of A B C So it is clear that E is not prime For if E is prime and measures D then it will also measure A despite A being prime and not being the same as it Prop 912 The very thing is impossible Thus E is not prime Thus it is composite And every composite number is measured by some prime number Prop 731 Thus E is measured by some prime num ber So I say that it will be measured by no other prime number than A For if E is measured by another prime number and E measures D then this prime number will thus also measure D Hence it will also measure A despite A being prime and not being the same as it Prop 912 The very thing is impossible Thus A mea sures E And since E measures D let it measure it ac cording to F I say that F is not the same as one of A B C For if F is the same as one of A B C and measures D according to E then one of A B C thus also measures D according to E But one of A B C only measures D according to some one of A B C Prop 911 And thus E is the same as one of A B C The very oppo site thing was assumed Thus F is not the same as one of A B C Similarly we can show that F is measured by A by again showing that F is not prime For if F is prime and measures D then it will also measure A despite A being prime and not being the same as it Prop 912 The very thing is impossible Thus F is not prime Thus it is composite And every composite number is measured by some prime number Prop 731 Thus F is measured by some prime number So I say that it will be measured by no other prime number than A For if some other prime number measures F and F measures D then this prime number will thus also measure D Hence it will also measure A despite A being prime and not being the same as it Prop 912 The very thing is impossible Thus A measures F And since E measures D according to F E has thus made D by multiplying F But in fact A has also made D by multiplying C Prop 911 corr Thus the number created from multiplying A C is equal to the number created from multiplying E F Thus proportionally as A is to E so F is to C Prop 719 And A measures 264STOIQEIWN j ELEMENTS BOOK 9 E Thus F also measures C Let it measure it according to G So similarly we can show that G is not the same as one of A B and that it is measured by A And since F measures C according to G F has thus made C by multiplying G But in fact A has also made C by mul tiplying B Prop 911 corr Thus the number created from multiplying A B is equal to the number created from multiplying F G Thus proportionally as A is to F so G is to B Prop 719 And A measures F Thus G also measures B Let it measure it according to H So similarly we can show that H is not the same as A And since G measures B according to H G has thus made B by multiplying H But in fact A has also made B by multiplying itself Prop 98 Thus the number created from multiplying H G is equal to the square on A Thus as H is to A so A is to G Prop 719 And A measures G Thus H also measures A despite A being prime and not being the same as it The very thing is absurd Thus the greatest number D cannot be measured by another number except one of A B C Which is the very thing it was required to show id Proposition 14 If a least number is measured by some prime num bers then it will not be measured by any other prime number except one of the original measuring num bers D A E F B C For let A be the least number measured by the prime numbers B C D I say that A will not be measured by any other prime number except one of B C D For if possible let it be measured by the prime num ber E And let E not be the same as one of B C D And since E measures A let it measure it according to F Thus E has made A by multiplying F And A is mea sured by the prime numbers B C D And if two num bers make some number by multiplying one another and some prime number measures the number created from them then the prime number will also measure one of the original numbers Prop 730 Thus B C D will measure one of E F In fact they do not measure E For E is prime and not the same as one of B C D Thus they all measure F which is less than A The very thing is impossible For A was assumed to be the least number measured by B C D Thus no prime 265STOIQEIWN j ELEMENTS BOOK 9 number can measure A except one of B C D Which is the very thing it was required to show ie Proposition 15 If three continuously proportional numbers are the least of those numbers having the same ratio as them then two of them added together in any way are prime to the remaining one E A B C F D Let A B C be three continuously proportional num bers which are the least of those numbers having the same ratio as them I say that two of A B C added to gether in any way are prime to the remaining one that is A and B prime to C B and C to A and further A and C to B Let the two least numbers DE and EF having the same ratio as A B C have been taken Prop 82 So it is clear that DE has made A by multiplying it self and has made B by multiplying EF and fur ther EF has made C by multiplying itself Prop 82 And since DE EF are the least of those numbers hav ing the same ratio as them they are prime to one an other Prop 722 And if two numbers are prime to one another then the sum of them is also prime to each Prop 728 Thus DF is also prime to each of DE EF But in fact DE is also prime to EF Thus DF DE are both prime to EF And if two numbers are both prime to some number then the number created from multiplying them is also prime to the remaining num ber Prop 724 Hence the number created from multiplying FD DE is prime to EF Hence the num ber created from multiplying FD DE is also prime to the square on EF Prop 725 For if two num bers are prime to one another then the number created from squaring one of them is prime to the remaining number But the number created from multiplying FD DE is the square on DE plus the number cre ated from multiplying DE EF Prop 23 Thus the square on DE plus the number created from multi plying DE EF is prime to the square on EF And the square on DE is A and the number created from multiplying DE EF is B and the square on EF is C Thus A B summed is prime to C So similarly we can show that B C summed is also prime to A So I say that A C summed is also prime to B For since 266STOIQEIWN j ELEMENTS BOOK 9 DF is prime to each of DE EF then the square on DF is also prime to the number created from multiplying DE EF Prop 725 But the sum of the squares on DE EF plus twice the number created from multiply ing DE EF is equal to the square on DF Prop 24 And thus the sum of the squares on DE EF plus twice the rectangle contained by DE EF is prime to the rectangle contained by DE EF By separation the sum of the squares on DE EF plus once the rect angle contained by DE EF is prime to the rectangle contained by DE EF Again by separation the sum of the squares on DE EF is prime to the rectangle contained by DE EF And the square on DE is A and the rectangle contained by DE EF is B and the square on EF is C Thus A C summed is prime to B Which is the very thing it was required to show Since if measures 2 2 2 then it also measures 2 2 and vice versa i Proposition 16 If two numbers are prime to one another then as the rst is to the second so the second will not be to some other number C A B For let the two numbers A and B be prime to one another I say that as A is to B so B is not to some other number For if possible let it be that as A is to B so B is to C And A and B are prime to one an other And numbers prime to one another are also the least of those numbers having the same ratio as them Prop 721 And the least numbers measure those numbers having the same ratio as them an equal number of times the leading measuring the lead ing and the following the following Prop 720 Thus A measures B as the leading measuring the leading And A also measures itself Thus A measures A and B which are prime to one another The very thing is ab surd Thus as A is to B so B cannot be to C Which is the very thing it was required to show iz Proposition 17 If any multitude whatsoever of numbers is continu ously proportional and the outermost of them are prime to one another then as the rst is to the second so the 267STOIQEIWN j ELEMENTS BOOK 9 last will not be to some other number Let A B C D be any multitude whatsoever of con tinuously proportional numbers And let the outermost of them A and D be prime to one another I say that as A is to B so D is not to some other number E A B C D For if possible let it be that as A is to B so D is to E Thus alternately as A is to D so B is to E Prop 713 And A and D are prime to one another And numbers prime to one another are also the least of those numbers having the same ra tio as them Prop 721 And the least numbers mea sure those numbers having the same ratio as them an equal number of times the leading measuring the lead ing and the following the following Prop 720 Thus A measures B And as A is to B so B is to C Thus B also measures C And hence A measures C Def 720 And since as B is to C so C is to D and B mea sures C C thus also measures D Def 720 But A was found to be measuring C And hence A also measures D And A also measures itself Thus A measures A and D which are prime to one another The very thing is impossible Thus as A is to B so D cannot be to some other number Which is the very thing it was required to show ih Proposition 18 For two given numbers to investigate whether it is possible to nd a third number proportional to them D A B C Let A and B be the two given numbers And let it be required to investigate whether it is possible to nd a third number proportional to them So A and B are either prime to one another or not And if they are prime to one another then it has already been show that it is impossible to nd a third number proportional to them Prop 916 And so let A and B not be prime to one another And let B make C by multiplying itself So A either mea sures or does not measure C Let it rst of all measure C according to D Thus A has made C by multiply 268STOIQEIWN j ELEMENTS BOOK 9 ing D But in fact B has also made C by multiplying itself Thus the number created from multiplying A D is equal to the square on B Thus as A is to B so B is to D Prop 719 Thus a third number has been found proportional to A B namely D And so let A not measure C I say that it is impossi ble to nd a third number proportional to A B For if possible let it have been found and let it be D Thus the number created from multiplying A D is equal to the square on B Prop 719 And the square on B is C Thus the number created from multiplying A D is equal to C Hence A has made C by multiplying D Thus A measures C according to D But A was in fact also assumed to be not measuring C The very thing is absurd Thus it is not possible to nd a third number proportional to A B when A does not measure C Which is the very thing it was required to show ij Proposition 19 For three given numbers to investigate when it is pos sible to nd a fourth number proportional to them C A B D E Let A B C be the three given numbers And let it be required to investigate when it is possible to nd a fourth number proportional to them In fact A B C are either not continuously pro portional and the outermost of them are prime to one another or are continuously proportional and the outer most of them are not prime to one another or are neither continuously proportional nor are the outermost of them prime to one another or are continuously proportional and the outermost of them are prime to one another In fact if A B C are continuously proportional and the outermost of them A and C are prime to one an other then it has already been shown that it is im possible to nd a fourth number proportional to them Prop 917 So let A B C not be continuously propor tional with the outermost of them again being prime to one another I say that in this case it is also impossible to nd a fourth number proportional to them For if possible let it have been found and let it be D Hence it will be that as A is to B so C is to D And let it be contrived that as B is to C so D is to E And since 269STOIQEIWN j ELEMENTS BOOK 9 as A is to B so C is to D and as B is to C so D is to E thus via equality as A is to C so C is to E Prop 714 And A and C are prime to one another And numbers prime to one another are also the least numbers having the same ratio as them Prop 721 And the least numbers measure those numbers having the same ratio as them the same number of times the leading measuring the leading and the following the following Prop 720 Thus A measures C as the leading measuring the leading And it also measures itself Thus A measures A and C which are prime to one another The very thing is impossible Thus it is not possible to nd a fourth number proportional to A B C And so let A B C again be continuously propor tional and let A and C not be prime to one another I say that it is possible to nd a fourth number propor tional to them For let B make D by multiplying C Thus A either measures or does not measure D Let it rst of all measure D according to E Thus A has made D by multiplying E But in fact B has also made D by multiplying C Thus the number created from multiplying A E is equal to the number created from multiplying B C Thus proportionally as A is to B so C is to E Prop 719 Thus a fourth number proportional to A B C has been found namely E And so let A not measure D I say that it is impossible to nd a fourth number proportional to A B C For if possible let it have been found and let it be E Thus the number created from multiplying A E is equal to the number created from multiplying B C But the number created from multiplying B C is D And thus the number created from multiplying A E is equal to D Thus A has made D by multiplying E Thus A measures D according to E Hence A measures D But it also does not measure D The very thing is absurd Thus it is not possible to nd a fourth number propor tional to A B C when A does not measure D And so let A B C be neither continuously proportional nor let the outermost of them be prime to one another And let B make D by multiplying C So similarly it can be show that if A measures D then it is possible to nd a fourth number proportional to A B C and impossible if A does not measure D Which is the very thing it was required to show The proof of this proposition is incorrect There are in fact only two cases Either A B C are continuously proportional with A and C prime to one another or not In the rst case it is impossible to nd a fourth proportional number In the second case it is possible to nd a fourth proportional number provided that A measures B times C Of the four cases considered by Euclid the proof given in the second case is incorrect since it only demonstrates that if A B C D then a number E cannot be found such that B C D E The proofs given in the other three 270STOIQEIWN j ELEMENTS BOOK 9 cases are correct k Proposition 20 The set of all prime numbers is more numerous than any assigned multitude of prime numbers F E A B C G D Let A B C be the assigned prime numbers I say that the set of all primes numbers is more numerous than A B C For let the least number measured by A B C have been taken and let it be DE Prop 736 And let the unit DF have been added to DE So EF is either prime or not Let it rst of all be prime Thus the set of prime numbers A B C EF which is more numerous than A B C has been found And so let EF not be prime Thus it is measured by some prime number Prop 731 Let it be measured by the prime number G I say that G is not the same as any of A B C For if possible let it be the same And A B C all measure DE Thus G will also measure DE And it also measures EF So G will also mea sure the remainder unit DF despite being a number Prop 728 The very thing is absurd Thus G is not the same as one of A B C And it was assumed to be prime Thus the set of prime numbers A B C G which is more numerous than the assigned multitude of prime numbers A B C has been found Which is the very thing it was required to show ka Proposition 21 If any multitude whatsoever of even numbers is added together then the whole is even C D E A B For let any multitude whatsoever of even numbers AB BC CD DE lie together I say that the whole AE is even For since everyone of AB BC CD DE is even it has a half part Def 76 And hence the whole AE has a half part And an even number is one which can be divided in half Def 76 Thus AE is even Which is 271STOIQEIWN j ELEMENTS BOOK 9 the very thing it was required to show kb Proposition 22 If any multitude whatsoever of odd numbers is added together and the multitude of them is even then the whole will be even C D E A B For let any even multitude whatsoever of odd num bers AB BC CD DE lie together I say that the whole AE is even For since everyone of AB BC CD DE is odd then a unit being subtracted from each everyone of the remain ders will be made even Def 77 And hence the sum of them will be even Prop 921 And the multitude of the units is even Thus the whole AE is also even Prop 921 Which is the very thing it was required to show kg Proposition 23 If any multitude whatsoever of odd numbers is added together and the multitude of them is odd then the whole will also be odd E A B C D For let any multitude whatsoever of odd numbers AB BC CD lie together and let the multitude of them be odd I say that the whole AD is also odd For let the unit DE have been subtracted from CD The remainder CE is thus even Def 77 And CA is also even Prop 922 Thus the whole AE is also even Prop 921 And DE is a unit Thus AD is odd Def 77 Which is the very thing it was required to show kd Proposition 24 If an even number is subtracted from another even number then the remainder will be even A C B For let the even number BC have been subtracted from the even number AB I say that the remainder CA is even For since AB is even it has a half part Def 76 So for the same reasons BC also has a half part And hence the remainder CA has a half part Thus AC is even Which is the very thing it was required to show 272STOIQEIWN j ELEMENTS BOOK 9 ke Proposition 25 If an odd number is subtracted from an even num ber then the remainder will be odd B A C D For let the odd number BC have been subtracted from the even number AB I say that the remainder CA is odd For let the unit CD have been subtracted from BC DB is thus even Def 77 And AB is also even And thus the remainder AD is even Prop 924 And CD is a unit Thus CA is odd Def 77 Which is the very thing it was required to show k Proposition 26 If an odd number is subtracted from an odd number then the remainder will be even C A D B For let the odd number BC have been subtracted from the odd number AB I say that the remainder CA is even For since AB is odd let the unit BD have been subtracted from it Thus the remainder AD is even Def 77 So for the same reasons CD is also even And hence the remainder CA is even Prop 924 Which is the very thing it was required to show kz Proposition 27 If an even number is subtracted from an odd num ber then the remainder will be odd C A D B For let the even number BC have been subtracted from the odd number AB I say that the remainder CA is odd For let the unit AD have been subtracted from AB DB is thus even Def 77 And BC is also even Thus the remainder CD is also even Prop 924 CA is thus odd Def 77 Which is the very thing it was required to show kh Proposition 28 If an odd number makes some number by multiply ing an even number then the created number will be even 273STOIQEIWN j ELEMENTS BOOK 9 C A B For let the odd number A make C by multiplying the even number B I say that C is even For since A has made C by multiplying B C is thus composed out of so many magnitudes equal to B as many as there are units in A Def 715 And B is even Thus C is composed out of even numbers And if any multitude whatsoever of even numbers is added together then the whole is even Prop 921 Thus C is even Which is the very thing it was required to show kj Proposition 29 If an odd number makes some number by multiply ing an odd number then the created number will be odd C A B For let the odd number A make C by multiplying the odd number B I say that C is odd For since A has made C by multiplying B C is thus composed out of so many magnitudes equal to B as many as there are units in A Def 715 And each of A B is odd Thus C is composed out of odd num bers and the multitude of them is odd Hence C is odd Prop 923 Which is the very thing it was required to show l Proposition 30 If an odd number measures an even number then it will also measure one half of it A C B For let the odd number A measure the even number B I say that A will also measure one half of B For since A measures B let it measure it according to C I say that C is not odd For if possible let it be odd And since A measures B according to C A has thus made B by multiplying C Thus B is composed out of odd numbers and the multitude of them is odd B is thus 274STOIQEIWN j ELEMENTS BOOK 9 odd Prop 923 The very thing is absurd For B was assumed to be even Thus C is not odd Thus C is even Hence A measures B an even number of times So on account of this A will also measure one half of B Which is the very thing it was required to show la Proposition 31 If an odd number is prime to some number then it will also be prime to its double D A B C For let the odd number A be prime to some number B And let C be double B I say that A is also prime to C For if A and C are not prime to one another then some number will measure them Let it measure them and let it be D And A is odd Thus D is also odd And since D which is odd measures C and C is even D will thus also measure half of C Prop 930 And B is half of C Thus D measures B And it also measures A Thus D measures both A and B despite them being prime to one another The very thing is impossible Thus A is not unprime to C Thus A and C are prime to one another Which is the very thing it was required to show lb Proposition 32 Each of the numbers which is continually doubled starting from a dyad is an eventimeseven number only D A B C For let any multitude of numbers whatsoever B C D have been continually doubled starting from the dyad A I say that B C D are eventimeseven num bers only In fact it is clear that each of B C D is an eventimeseven number For it is doubled from a dyad Def 78 I also say that they are eventimeseven num bers only For let a unit be laid down Therefore since 275STOIQEIWN j ELEMENTS BOOK 9 any multitude of numbers whatsoever are continuously proportional starting from a unit and the number A af ter the unit is prime the greatest of A B C D namely D will not be measured by any other numbers except A B C Prop 913 And each of A B C is even Thus D is an eventimeeven number only Def 78 So similarly we can show that each of B C is also an even timeeven number only Which is the very thing it was required to show lg Proposition 33 If a number has an odd half then it is an eventime odd number only A For let the number A have an odd half I say that A is an eventimesodd number only In fact it is clear that A is an eventimesodd number For its half being odd measures it an even number of times Def 79 So I also say that it is an eventimesodd number only For if A is also an eventimeseven number then it will be measured by an even number according to an even number Def 78 Hence its half will also be measured by an even number despite being odd The very thing is absurd Thus A is an eventimesodd number only Which is the very thing it was required to show ld Proposition 34 If a number is neither one of the numbers doubled from a dyad nor has an odd half then it is both an eventimeseven and an eventimesodd number A For let the number A neither be one of the num bers doubled from a dyad nor let it have an odd half I say that A is both an eventimeseven and an even timesodd number In fact it is clear that A is an eventimeseven num ber Def 78 For it does not have an odd half So I say that it is also an eventimesodd number For if we cut A in half and then cut its half in half and we do this continually then we will arrive at some odd num ber which will measure A according to an even number For if not we will arrive at a dyad and A will be one of the numbers doubled from a dyad The very oppo site thing was assumed Hence A is an eventimesodd number Def 79 And it was also shown to be an eventimeseven number Thus A is both an even timeseven and an eventimesodd number Which is 276STOIQEIWN j ELEMENTS BOOK 9 the very thing it was required to show le Proposition 35 If there is any multitude whatsoever of continually proportional numbers and numbers equal to the rst are subtracted from both the second and the last then as the excess of the second number is to the rst so the excess of the last will be to the sum of all those num bers before it L E B A D C F G H K Let A BC D EF be any multitude whatsoever of continuously proportional numbers beginning from the least A And let BG and FH each equal to A have been subtracted from BC and EF respectively I say that as GC is to A so EH is to A BC D For let FK be made equal to BC and FL to D And since FK is equal to BC of which FH is equal to BG the remainder HK is thus equal to the remainder GC And since as EF is to D so D is to BC and BC to A Prop 713 and D is equal to FL and BC to FK and A to FH thus as EF is to FL so LF is to FK and FK to FH By separation as EL is to LF so LK is to FK and KH to FH Props 711 713 And thus as one of the leading numbers is to one of the following so the sum of all of the leading numbers is to the sum of all of the following Prop 712 Thus as KH is to FH so EL LK KH are to LF FK HF And KH is equal to CG and FH to A and LF FK HF to D BC A Thus as CG is to A so EH is to D BC A Thus as the excess of the second number is to the rst so the excess of the last is to the sum of all those numbers before it Which is the very thing it was required to show This proposition allows us to sum a geometric series of the form a a r a r2 a r3 a rn1 According to Euclid the sum Sn satises a r aa a rn aSn Hence Sn a rn 1r 1 l Proposition 36 If any multitude whatsoever of numbers is set out con tinuously in a double proportion starting from a unit until the whole sum added together becomes prime and 277STOIQEIWN j ELEMENTS BOOK 9 the sum multiplied into the last number makes some number then the number so created will be perfect For let any multitude of numbers A B C D be set out continuouly in a double proportion until the whole sum added together is made prime And let E be equal to the sum And let E make FG by multiplying D I say that FG is a perfect number D A B C G N K E L M P Q F O H For as many as is the multitude of A B C D let so many numbers E HK L M have been taken in a double proportion starting from E Thus via equal ity as A is to D so E is to M Prop 714 Thus the number created from multiplying E D is equal to the number created from multiplying A M And FG is the number created from multiplying E D Thus FG is also the number created from multiplying A M Prop 719 Thus A has made FG by multiplying M Thus M measures FG according to the units in A And A is a dyad Thus FG is double M And M L HK E are also continuously double one another Thus E HK L M FG are continuously proportional in a double proportion So let HN and FO each equal to the rst number E have been subtracted from the second number HK and the last FG respectively Thus as the excess of the second number is to the rst so the ex cess of the last is to the sum of all those numbers before it Prop 935 Thus as NK is to E so OG is to M L KH E And NK is equal to E And thus OG is equal to M L HK E And FO is also equal to E and E to A B C D and a unit Thus the whole of FG is equal to E HK L M and A B C D and a unit And it is measured by them I also say that FG will be 278STOIQEIWN j ELEMENTS BOOK 9 measured by no other numbers except A B C D E HK L M and a unit For if possible let some num ber P measure FG and let P not be the same as any of A B C D E HK L M And as many times as P measures FG so many units let there be in Q Thus Q has made FG by multiplying P But in fact E has also made FG by multiplying D Thus as E is to Q so P is to D Prop 719 And since A B C D are con tinually proportional starting from a unit D will thus not be measured by any other numbers except A B C Prop 913 And P was assumed not to be the same as any of A B C Thus P does not measure D But as P is to D so E is to Q Thus E does not mea sure Q either Def 720 And E is a prime number And every prime number is prime to every number which it does not measure Prop 729 Thus E and Q are prime to one another And numbers prime to one another are also the least of those numbers having the same ratio as them Prop 721 and the least num bers measure those numbers having the same ratio as them an equal number of times the leading measuring the leading and the following the following Prop 720 And as E is to Q so P is to D Thus E measures P the same number of times as Q measures D And D is not measured by any other numbers except A B C Thus Q is the same as one of A B C Let it be the same as B And as many as is the multitude of B C D let so many of the set out numbers have been taken start ing from E namely E HK L And E HK L are in the same ratio as B C D Thus via equality as B is to D so E is to L Prop 714 Thus the number created from multiplying B L is equal to the num ber created from multiplying D E Prop 719 But the number created from multiplying D E is equal to the number created from multiplying Q P Thus the number created from multiplying Q P is equal to the number created from multiplying B L Thus as Q is to B so L is to P Prop 719 And Q is the same as B Thus L is also the same as P The very thing is impossible For P was assumed not to be the same as any of the numbers set out Thus FG cannot be measured by any number except A B C D E HK L M and a unit And FG was shown to be equal to the sum of A B C D E HK L M and a unit And a perfect number is one which is equal to the sum of its own parts Def 722 Thus FG is a perfect number Which is the very thing it was required to show This proposition demonstrates that perfect numbers take the form 2n1 2n 1 provided that 2n 1 is a prime number The ancient Greeks knew of four perfect numbers 6 28 496 and 8128 which correspond to n 2 3 5 and 7 respectively 279280ELEMENTS BOOK 10 Incommensurable Magnitudes The theory of incommensurable magntidues set out in this book is generally attributed to Theaetetus of Athens In the footnotes throughout this book k k etc stand for distinct ratios of positive integers 281STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 V Oroi Denitions 1 Those magnitudes measured by the same measure are said to be commensurable but those of which no magnitude admits to be a common measure are said to be incommensurable 2 Two straightlines are commensurable in square when the squares on them are measured by the same area but are incommensurable in square when no area admits to be a common measure of the squares on them 3 These things being assumed it is proved that there exist an innite multitude of straightlines commensu rable and incommensurable with an assigned straight linethose incommensurable in length only and those also commensurable or incommensurable in square Therefore let the assigned straightline be called ratio nal And let the straightlines commensurable with it either in length and square or in square only also be called rational But let the straightlines incommensu rable with it be called irrational 4 And let the square on the assigned straightline be called rational And let areas commensurable with it also be called rational But let areas incommensu rable with it be called irrational and let their square roots also be called irrationalthe sides themselves if the areas are squares and the straightlines describ ing squares equal to them if the areas are some other rectilinear gure In other words two magnitudes and are commensurable if 1 k and incommensurable otherwise Literally in power In other words two straightlines of length and are commensurable in square if 1 k12 and incommensurable in square otherwise Likewise the straightlines are commensurable in length if 1 k and incommensurable in length otherwise To be more exact straightlines can either be commensurable in square only incommensurable in length only or commenusrableincommensurable in both length and square with an assigned straightline Let the length of the assigned straightline be unity Then rational straightlines have lengths expressible as k or k12 depending on whether the lengths are commensurable in length or in square only respectively with unity All other straightlines are irrational The squareroot of an area is the length of the side of an equal area square The area of the square on the assigned straightline is unity Rational areas are expressible as k All other areas are irrational Thus squares whose sides are of rational length have rational areas and vice versa a Proposition 1 If from the greater of two unequal magnitudes which are laid out a part greater than half is sub tracted and if from the remainder a part greater than half is subtracted and if this happens continually then some magnitude will eventually be left which will 282STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 be less than the lesser laid out magnitude Let AB and C be two unequal magnitudes of which let AB be the greater I say that if a part greater than half is subtracted from AB and if a part greater than half is subtracted from the remainder and if this happens continually then some magnitude will eventu ally be left which will be less than the magnitude C G E D A B C F K H For C when multiplied by some number will some times be greater than AB Def 54 Let it have been so multiplied And let DE be both a multiple of C and greater than AB And let DE have been divided into the divisions DF FG GE equal to C And let BH which is greater than half have been subtracted from AB And let HK which is greater than half have been subtracted from AH And let this happen continu ally until the divisions in AB become equal in number to the divisions in DE Therefore let the divisions in AB be AK KH HB being equal in number to DF FG GE And since DE is greater than AB and EG which is less than half has been subtracted from DE and BH which is greater than half from AB the remainder GD is thus greater than the remainder HA And since GD is greater than HA and the half GF has been subtracted from GD and HK which is greater than half from HA the remain der DF is thus greater than the remainder AK And DF is equal to C C is thus also greater than AK Thus AK is less than C Thus the magnitude AK which is less than the lesser laid out magnitude C is left over from the magnitude AB Which is the very thing it was required to show The theorem can similarly be proved even if the parts subtracted are halves This theorem is the basis of the socalled method of exhaustion and is generally attributed to Eudoxus of Cnidus b Proposition 2 If the remainder of two unequal magnitudes which are laid out never measures the magnitude before it when the lesser magnitude is continually subtracted in turn from the greater then the original magnitudes will be incommensurable For AB and CD being two unequal magnitudes and AB being the lesser let the remainder never measure 283STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 the magnitude before it when the lesser magnitude is continually subtracted in turn from the greater I say that the magnitudes AB and CD are incommensurable C E A B D F G For if they are commensurable then some magnitude will measure them both If possible let it so measure them and let it be E And let AB leave CF less than itself in measuring FD and let CF leave AG less than itself in measuring BG and let this happen continually until some magnitude which is less than E is left Let this have occurred and let AG which is less than E have been left Therefore since E measures AB but AB measures DF E will thus also measure FD And it also measures the whole of CD Thus it will also mea sure the remainder CF But CF measures BG Thus E also measures BG And it also measures the whole of AB Thus it will also measure the remainder AG the greater measuring the lesser The very thing is impos sible Thus some magnitude cannot measure both the magnitudes AB and CD Thus the magnitudes AB and CD are incommensurable Def 101 Thus if of two unequal magnitudes and so on The fact that this will eventually occur is guaranteed by Prop 101 g Proposition 3 To nd the greatest common measure of two given commensurable magnitudes G B E D A F C Let AB and CD be the two given magnitudes of which let AB be the lesser So it is required to nd the greatest common measure of AB and CD For the magnitude AB either measures or does not measure CD Therefore if it measures CD and since it also measures itself AB is thus a common mea sure of AB and CD And it is clear that it is also the greatest For a magnitude greater than magnitude AB cannot measure AB So let AB not measure CD And continually subtract ing in turn the lesser magnitude from the greater the 284STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 remaining magnitude will at some time measure the magnitude before it on account of AB and CD not be ing incommensurable Prop 102 And let AB leave EC less than itself in measuring ED and let EC leave AF less than itself in measuring FB and let AF measure CE Therefore since AF measures CE but CE measures FB AF will thus also measure FB And it also mea sures itself Thus AF will also measure the whole of AB But AB measures DE Thus AF will also mea sure ED And it also measures CE Thus it also mea sures the whole of CD Thus AF is a common measure of AB and CD So I say that it is also the greatest common measure For if not there will be some mag nitude greater than AF which will measure both AB and CD Let it be G Therefore since G measures AB but AB measures ED G will thus also measure ED And it also measures the whole of CD Thus G will also mea sure the remainder CE But CE measures FB Thus G will also measure FB And it also measures the whole of AB And so it will measure the remainder AF the greater measuring the lesser The very thing is im possible Thus some magnitude greater than AF cannot measure both AB and CD Thus AF is the greatest common measure of AB and CD Thus the greatest common measure of two given commensurable magnitudes AB and CD has been found Which is the very thing it was required to show Pri sma Corollary So it is clear from this that if a magnitude measures two magnitudes then it will also measure their greatest common measure d Proposition 4 To nd the greatest common measure of three given commensurable magnitudes C D E F A B Let A B C be the three given commensurable mag nitudes So it is required to nd the greatest common measure of A B C For let the greatest common measure of the two mag nitudes A and B have been taken Prop 103 and let it 285STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 be D So D either measures or does not measure C Let it rst of all measure C Therefore since D mea sures C and it also measures A and B D thus measures A B C Thus D is a common measure of A B C And it is clear that it is also the greatest common mea sure For no magnitude larger than D measures both A and B So let D not measure C I say rst that C and D are commensurable For if A B C are commensurable then some magnitude will measure them which will clearly also measure A and B Hence it will also measure D the greatest common measure of A and B Prop 103 corr And it also measures C Hence the aforementioned mag nitude will measure both C and D Thus C and D are commensurable Def 101 Therefore let their greatest common measure have been taken Prop 103 and let it be E Therefore since E measures D but D measures both A and B E will thus also measure A and B And it also measures C Thus E measures A B C Thus E is a common measure of A B C So I say that it is also the greatest common measure For if possible let F be some magnitude greater than E and let it measure A B C And since F measures A B C it will thus also measure A and B and will thus measure the greatest common measure of A and B Prop 103 corr And D is the greatest common measure of A and B Thus F measures D And it also measures C Thus F measures both C and D Thus F will also measure the greatest common measure of C and D Prop 103 corr And it is E Thus F will measure E the greater measuring the lesser The very thing is impossible Thus some magni tude greater than the magnitude E cannot measure A B C Thus if D does not measure C then E is the great est common measure of A B C And if it does measure C then D itself is the greatest common measure Thus the greatest common measure of three given commensurable magnitudes has been found Which is the very thing it was required to show Pri sma Corollary So it is clear from this that if a magnitude measures three magnitudes then it will also measure their greatest common measure So similarly the greatest common measure of more magnitudes can also be taken and the above corol lary will go forward Which is the very thing it was required to show 286STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 e Proposition 5 Commensurable magnitudes have to one another the ratio which some number has to some number C E D A B Let A and B be commensurable magnitudes I say that A has to B the ratio which some number has to some number For if A and B are commensurable magnitudes then some magnitude will measure them Let it so measure them and let it be C And as many times as C measures A so many units let there be in D And as many times as C measures B so many units let there be in E Therefore since C measures A according to the units in D and a unit also measures D according to the units in it a unit thus measures the number D as many times as the magnitude C measures A Thus as C is to A so a unit is to D Def 720 Thus inversely as A is to C so D is to a unit Prop 57 corr Again since C measures B according to the units in E and a unit also measures E according to the units in it a unit thus measures E the same number of times that C measures B Thus as C is to B so a unit is to E Def 720 And it was also shown that as A is to C so D is to a unit Thus via equality as A is to B so the number D is to the number E Prop 522 Thus the commensurable magnitudes A and B have to one another the ratio which the number D has to the number E Which is the very thing it was required to show There is a slight logical gap here since Def 720 applies to four numbers rather than two number and two magnitudes Proposition 6 If two magnitudes have to one another the ratio which some number has to some number then the magni tudes will be commensurable F A D C B E For let the two magnitudes A and B have to one an other the ratio which the number D has to the number E I say that the magnitudes A and B are commensu rable 287STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 For as many units as there are in D let A have been divided into so many equal divisions And let C be equal to one of them And as many units as there are in E let F be the sum of so many magnitudes equal to C Therefore since as many units as there are in D so many magnitudes equal to C are also in A therefore whichever part a unit is of D C is also the same part of A Thus as C is to A so a unit is to D Def 720 And a unit measures the number D Thus C also measures A And since as C is to A so a unit is to the number D thus inversely as A is to C so the number D is to a unit Prop 57 corr Again since as many units as there are in E so many magnitudes equal to C are also in F thus as C is to F so a unit is to the number E Def 720 And it was also shown that as A is to C so D is to a unit Thus via equality as A is to F so D is to E Prop 522 But as D is to E so A is to B And thus as A is to B so it also is to F Prop 511 Thus A has the same ratio to each of B and F Thus B is equal to F Prop 59 And C measures F Thus it also measures B But in fact it also measures A Thus C measures both A and B Thus A is commensurable with B Def 101 Thus if two magnitudes to one another and so on Pri sma Corollary So it is clear from this that if there are two numbers like D and E and a straightline like A then it is possible to contrive that as the number D is to the number E so the straightline is to another straightline ie F And if the mean proportion say B is taken of A and F then as A is to F so the square on A will be to the square on B That is to say as the rst is to the third so the gure on the rst is to the similar and similarly described gure on the second Prop 619 corr But as A is to F so the number D is to the number E Thus it has also been contrived that as the number D is to the number E so the gure on the straightline A is to the similar gure on the straightline B Which is the very thing it was required to show z Proposition 7 Incommensurable magnitudes do not have to one an other the ratio which some number has to some number Let A and B be incommensurable magnitudes I say that A does not have to B the ratio which some number has to some number 288STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 B A For if A has to B the ratio which some number has to some number then A will be commensurable with B Prop 106 But it is not Thus A does not have to B the ratio which some number has to some number Thus incommensurable numbers do not have to one another and so on h Proposition 8 If two magnitudes do not have to one another the ra tio which some number has to some number then the magnitudes will be incommensurable B A For let the two magnitudes A and B not have to one another the ratio which some number has to some number I say that the magnitudes A and B are incom mensurable For if they are commensurable A will have to B the ratio which some number has to some number Prop 105 But it does not have such a ratio Thus the magnitudes A and B are incommensurable Thus if two magnitudes to one another and so on j Proposition 9 Squares on straightlines which are commensurable in length have to one another the ratio which some square number has to some square number And squares having to one another the ratio which some square number has to some square number will also have sides which are commensurable in length But squares on straightlines which are incommensurable in length do not have to one another the ratio which some square number has to some square number And squares not having to one another the ratio which some square number has to some square number will not have sides which are commensurable in length either D A C B For let A and B be straightlines which are commen surable in length I say that the square on A has to the square on B the ratio which some square number has to some square number 289STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 For since A is commensurable in length with B A thus has to B the ratio which some number has to some number Prop 105 Let it have that which C has to D Therefore since as A is to B so C is to D But the ratio of the square on A to the square on B is the square of the ratio of A to B For similar gures are in the squared ratio of their corresponding sides Prop 620 corr And the ratio of the square on C to the square on D is the square of the ratio of the number C to the number D For there exits one number in mean proportion to two square numbers and one square number has to the other square num ber a squared ratio with respect to that the side of the former has to the side of the latter Prop 811 And thus as the square on A is to the square on B so the square number on the number C is to the square number on the number D And so let the square on A be to the square on B as the square number on C is to the square number on D I say that A is commensurable in length with B For since as the square on A is to the square on B so the square number on C is to the square number on D But the ratio of the square on A to the square on B is the square of the ratio of A to B Prop 620 corr And the ratio of the square number on the number C to the square number on the number D is the square of the ratio of the number C to the number D Prop 811 Thus as A is to B so the number C also is to the number D A thus has to B the ratio which the number C has to the number D Thus A is commensurable in length with B Prop 106 And so let A be incommensurable in length with B I say that the square on A does not have to the square on B the ratio which some square number has to some square number For if the square on A has to the square on B the ra tio which some square number has to some square number then A will be commensurable in length with B But it is not Thus the square on A does not have to the square on the B the ratio which some square number has to some square number So again let the square on A not have to the square on B the ratio which some square number has to some square number I say that A is incommensurable in length with B For if A is commensurable in length with B then the square on A will have to the square on B the ra tio which some square number has to some square number But it does not have such a ratio Thus A is not commensurable in length with B Thus squares on straightlines which are com 290STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 mensurable in length and so on Pri sma Corollary And it will be clear from what has been demon strated that straightlines commensurable in length are always also commensurable in square but straight lines commensurable in square are not always also commensurable in length There is an unstated assumption here that if then 2 2 2 2 There is an unstated assumption here that if 2 2 2 2 then i Proposition 10 To nd two straightlines incommensurable with a given straightline the one incommensurable in length only the other also incommensurable in square C A E D B Let A be the given straightline So it is required to nd two straightlines incommensurable with A the one incommensurable in length only the other also incom mensurable in square For let two numbers B and C not having to one another the ratio which some square number has to some square numberthat is to say not being simi lar plane numbershave been taken And let it be con trived that as B is to C so the square on A is to the square on D For we learned how to do this Prop 106 corr Thus the square on A is commensurable with the square on D Prop 106 And since B does not have to C the ratio which some square number has to some square number the square on A thus does not have to the square on D the ratio which some square number has to some square number either Thus A is incommensurable in length with D Prop 109 Let the straightline E which is in mean proportion to A and D have been taken Prop 613 Thus as A is to D so the square on A is to the square on E Def 59 And A is incommensurable in length with D Thus the square on A is also incommensurble with the square on E Prop 1011 Thus A is incommensurable in square with E 291STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 Thus two straightlines D and E which are in commensurable with the given straightline A have been found the one D incommensurable in length only the other E incommensurable in square and clearly also in length Which is the very thing it was required to show This whole proposition is regarded by Heiberg as an interpolation into the original text ia Proposition 11 If four magnitudes are proportional and the rst is commensurable with the second then the third will also be commensurable with the fourth And if the rst is in commensurable with the second then the third will also be incommensurable with the fourth D A C B Let A B C D be four proportional magnitudes such that as A is to B so C is to D And let A be commensurable with B I say that C will also be com mensurable with D For since A is commensurable with B A thus has to B the ratio which some number has to some number Prop 105 And as A is to B so C is to D Thus C also has to D the ratio which some number has to some number Thus C is commensurable with D Prop 106 And so let A be incommensurable with B I say that C will also be incommensurable with D For since A is incommensurable with B A thus does not have to B the ratio which some number has to some number Prop 107 And as A is to B so C is to D Thus C does not have to D the ratio which some number has to some number either Thus C is incommensurable with D Prop 108 Thus if four magnitudes and so on ib Proposition 12 Magnitudes commensurable with the same magni tude are also commensurable with one another For let A and B each be commensurable with C I say that A is also commensurable with B For since A is commensurable with C A thus has to C the ratio which some number has to some number Prop 105 Let it have the ratio which D has to E Again since C is commensurable with B C thus has to B the ratio which some number has to some number Prop 105 Let it have the ratio which F has to G And for any multitude whatsoever 292STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 of given ratiosnamely those which D has to E and F to Glet the numbers H K L which are contin uously proportional in these given ratios have been taken Prop 84 Hence as D is to E so H is to K and as F is to G so K is to L G B C H K L A D E F Therefore since as A is to C so D is to E but as D is to E so H is to K thus also as A is to C so H is to K Prop 511 Again since as C is to B so F is to G but as F is to G so K is to L thus also as C is to B so K is to L Prop 511 And also as A is to C so H is to K Thus via equality as A is to B so H is to L Prop 522 Thus A has to B the ratio which the number H has to the number L Thus A is commensurable with B Prop 106 Thus magnitudes commensurable with the same magnitude are also commensurable with one another Which is the very thing it was required to show ig Proposition 13 If two magnitudes are commensurable and one of them is incommensurable with some magnitude then the remaining magnitude will also be incommensurable with it B A C Let A and B be two commensurable magnitudes and let one of them A be incommensurable with some other magnitude C I say that the remaining magnitude B is also incommensurable with C For if B is commensurable with C but A is also com mensurable with B A is thus also commensurable with C Prop 1012 But it is also incommensurable with C The very thing is impossible Thus B is not com mensurable with C Thus it is incommensurable Thus if two magnitudes are commensurable and so on Lmma Lemma For two given unequal

given unequal straightlines and let AB be the greater of them So it is required to nd by the square on which straightline the square on AB is greater than the square on C Let the semicircle ADB have been described on AB And let AD equal to C have been inserted into it Prop 41 And let DB have been joined So it is clear that the angle ADB is a rightangle Prop 331 and that the square on AB is greater than the square on ADthat is to say the square on Cby the square on DB Prop 147 And similarly the squareroot of the sum of the squares on two given straightlines is also found likeso Let AD and DB be the two given straightlines And let it be necessary to nd the squareroot of the sum of the squares on them For let them have been laid down such as to encompass a rightanglenamely that angle encompassed by AD and DB And let AB have been joined It is again clear that AB is the squareroot of the sum of the squares on AD and DB Prop 147 Which is the very thing it was required to show That is if and are the lengths of two given straightlines with being greater than to nd a straightline of length such that 2 2 2 Similarly we can also nd such that 2 2 2 id Proposition 14 If four straightlines are proportional and the square on the rst is greater than the square on the sec ond by the square on some straightline commen surable in length with the rst then the square on the third will also be greater than the square on the fourth by the square on some straightline commen surable in length with the third And if the square on the rst is greater than the square on the second by the square on some straightline incommensurable in length with the rst then the square on the third will also be greater than the square on the fourth by the square on some straightline incommensurable in length with the third Let A B C D be four proportional straightlines such that as A is to B so C is to D And let the square on A be greater than the square on B by the 294STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 square on E and let the square on C be greater than the square on D by the square on F I say that A is either commensurable in length with E and C is also commensurable with F or A is incommensurable in length with E and C is also incommensurable with F D F A B E C For since as A is to B so C is to D thus as the square on A is to the square on B so the square on C is to the square on D Prop 622 But the sum of the squares on E and B is equal to the square on A and the sum of the squares on D and F is equal to the square on C Thus as the sum of the squares on E and B is to the square on B so the sum of the squares on D and F is to the square on D Thus via separation as the square on E is to the square on B so the square on F is to the square on D Prop 517 Thus also as E is to B so F is to D Prop 622 Thus inversely as B is to E so D is to F Prop 57 corr But as A is to B so C also is to D Thus via equality as A is to E so C is to F Prop 522 Therefore A is either commensurable in length with E and C is also commensurable with F or A is incommensurable in length with E and C is also incommensurable with F Prop 1011 Thus if and so on ie Proposition 15 If two commensurable magnitudes are added together then the whole will also be commensurable with each of them And if the whole is commensurable with one of them then the original magnitudes will also be commen surable with one another For let the two commensurable magnitudes AB and BC be laid down together I say that the whole AC is also commensurable with each of AB and BC 295STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 D A B C For since AB and BC are commensurable some mag nitude will measure them Let it so measure them and let it be D Therefore since D measures both AB and BC it will also measure the whole AC And it also measures AB and BC Thus D measures AB BC and AC Thus AC is commensurable with each of AB and BC Def 101 And so let AC be commensurable with AB I say that AB and BC are also commensurable For since AC and AB are commensurable some mag nitude will measure them Let it so measure them and let it be D Therefore since D measures both CA and AB it will thus also measure the remainder BC And it also measures AB Thus D will measure both AB and BC Thus AB and BC are commensurable Def 101 Thus if two magnitudes and so on i Proposition 16 If two incommensurable magnitudes are added to gether then the whole will also be incommensurable with each of them And if the whole is incommensurable with one of them then the original magnitudes will also be in commensurable with one another D A B C For let the two incommensurable magnitudes AB and BC be laid down together I say that that the whole AC is also incommensurable with each of AB and BC For if CA and AB are not incommensurable then some magnitude will measure them If possible let it so measure them and let it be D Therefore since D measures both CA and AB it will thus also mea sure the remainder BC And it also measures AB Thus D measures both AB and BC Thus AB and BC are commensurable Def 101 But they were also assumed to be incommensurable The very thing is impossible Thus some magnitude cannot measure both CA and AB Thus CA and AB are incommensurable Def 101 So similarly we can show that AC and CB are also incommensurable Thus AC is incommensurable with each of AB and BC And so let AC be incommensurable with one of AB and BC So let it rst of all be incommensurable with 296STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 AB I say that AB and BC are also incommensurable For if they are commensurable then some magnitude will measure them Let it so measure them and let it be D Therefore since D measures both AB and BC it will thus also measure the whole AC And it also mea sures AB Thus D measures both CA and AB Thus CA and AB are commensurable Def 101 But they were also assumed to be incommensurable The very thing is impossible Thus some magnitude cannot mea sure both AB and BC Thus AB and BC are incom mensurable Def 101 Thus if two magnitudes and so on Lmma Lemma If a parallelogram falling short by a square gure is applied to some straightline then the applied parallelo gram is equal in area to the rectangle contained by the pieces of the straightline created via the application of the parallelogram D B C A For let the parallelogram AD falling short by the square gure DB have been applied to the straightline AB I say that AD is equal to the rectangle contained by AC and CB And it is immediately obvious For since DB is a square DC is equal to CB And AD is the rectangle contained by AC and CDthat is to say by AC and CB Thus if to some straightline and so on Note that this lemma only applies to rectangular parallelograms iz Proposition 17 If there are two unequal straightlines and a rect angle equal to the fourth part of the square on the lesser falling short by a square gure is applied to the greater and divides it into parts which are commen surable in length then the square on the greater will be larger than the square on the lesser by the square on some straightline commensurable in length with the greater And if the square on the greater is larger than the square on the lesser by the square on some straightline commensurable in length with the 297STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 greater and a rectangle equal to the fourth part of the square on the lesser falling short by a square gure is applied to the greater then it divides it into parts which are commensurable in length Let A and BC be two unequal straightlines of which let BC be the greater And let a rectangle equal to the fourth part of the square on the lesser Athat is equal to the square on half of Afalling short by a square gure have been applied to BC And let it be the rectangle contained by BD and DC see previous lemma And let BD be commensurable in length with DC I say that that the square on BC is greater than the square on A by the square on some straightline commensurable in length with BC C E B D A F For let BC have been cut in half at the point E Prop 110 And let EF be made equal to DE Prop 13 Thus the remainder DC is equal to BF And since the straightline BC has been cut into equal pieces at E and into unequal pieces at D the rectangle contained by BD and DC plus the square on ED is thus equal to the square on EC Prop 25 The same also for the quadruples Thus four times the rectangle contained by BD and DC plus the quadruple of the square on DE is equal to four times the square on EC But the square on A is equal to the quadruple of the rectangle contained by BD and DC and the square on DF is equal to the quadruple of the square on DE For DF is double DE And the square on BC is equal to the quadruple of the square on EC For again BC is dou ble CE Thus the sum of the squares on A and DF is equal to the square on BC Hence the square on BC is greater than the square on A by the square on DF Thus BC is greater in square than A by DF It must also be shown that BC is commensurable in length with DF For since BD is commensurable in length with DC BC is thus also commensurable in length with CD Prop 1015 But CD is commensurable in length with CD plus BF For CD is equal to BF Prop 106 Thus BC is also commensurable in length with BF plus CD Prop 1012 Hence BC is also commensurable in length with the remainder FD Prop 1015 Thus the square on BC is greater than the square on A by the square on some straightline commensurable in length with BC 298STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 And so let the square on BC be greater than the square on A by the square on some straightline commensurable in length with BC And let a rect angle equal to the fourth part of the square on A falling short by a square gure have been applied to BC And let it be the rectangle contained by BD and DC It must be shown that BD is commensurable in length with DC For similarly by the same construction we can show that the square on BC is greater than the square on A by the square on FD And the square on BC is greater than the square on A by the square on some straight line commensurable in length with BC Thus BC is commensurable in length with FD Hence BC is also commensurable in length with the remaining sum of BF and DC Prop 1015 But the sum of BF and DC is commensurable in length with DC Prop 106 Hence BC is also commensurable in length with CD Prop 1012 Thus via separation BD is also commen surable in length with DC Prop 1015 Thus if there are two unequal straightlines and so on This proposition states that if x x2 24 where BC x DC and A then and p 2 2 are commensurable when x are x are commensurable and vice versa ih Proposition 18 If there are two unequal straightlines and a rect angle equal to the fourth part of the square on the lesser falling short by a square gure is applied to the greater and divides it into parts which are incom mensurable in length then the square on the greater will be larger than the square on the lesser by the square on some straightline incommensurable in length with the greater And if the square on the greater is larger than the square on the lesser by the square on some straightline incommensurable in length with the greater and a rectangle equal to the fourth part of the square on the lesser falling short by a square gure is applied to the greater then it divides it into parts which are incommensurable in length Let A and BC be two unequal straightlines of which let BC be the greater And let a rectangle equal to the fourth part of the square on the lesser A falling short by a square gure have been applied to BC And let it be the rectangle contained by BDC And let BD be incommensurable in length with DC I say that that the square on BC is greater than the square on A by the square on some straightline incommensurable in length with BC 299STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 F E B A C D For similarly by the same construction as before we can show that the square on BC is greater than the square on A by the square on FD Therefore it must be shown that BC is incommensurable in length with DF For since BD is incommensurable in length with DC BC is thus also incommensurable in length with CD Prop 1016 But DC is commensurable in length with the sum of BF and DC Prop 106 And thus BC is incommensurable in length with the sum of BF and DC Prop 1013 Hence BC is also incommen surable in length with the remainder FD Prop 1016 And the square on BC is greater than the square on A by the square on FD Thus the square on BC is greater than the square on A by the square on some straightline incommensurable in length with BC So again let the square on BC be greater than the square on A by the square on some straightline in commensurable in length with BC And let a rect angle equal to the fourth part of the square on A falling short by a square gure have been applied to BC And let it be the rectangle contained by BD and DC It must be shown that BD is incommensurable in length with DC For similarly by the same construction we can show that the square on BC is greater than the square on A by the square on FD But the square on BC is greater than the square on A by the square on some straightline incommensurable in length with BC Thus BC is incommensurable in length with FD Hence BC is also incommensurable in length with the re maining sum of BF and DC Prop 1016 But the sum of BF and DC is commensurable in length with DC Prop 106 Thus BC is also incommensurable in length with DC Prop 1013 Hence via separa tion BD is also incommensurable in length with DC Prop 1016 Thus if there are two straightlines and so on This proposition states that if x x2 24 where BC x DC and A then and p 2 2 are incommensurable when x are x are incommensurable and vice versa ij Proposition 19 The rectangle contained by rational straightlines which are commensurable in length is rational For let the rectangle AC have been enclosed by the 300STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 rational straightlines AB and BC which are commen surable in length I say that AC is rational A B D C For let the square AD have been described on AB AD is thus rational Def 104 And since AB is com mensurable in length with BC and AB is equal to BD BD is thus commensurable in length with BC And as BD is to BC so DA is to AC Prop 61 Thus DA is commensurable with AC Prop 1011 And DA is rational Thus AC is also rational Def 104 Thus the by rational straightlines commensurable and so on k Proposition 20 If a rational area is applied to a rational straight line then it produces as breadth a straightline which is rational and commensurable in length with the straight line to which it is applied D B A C For let the rational area AC have been applied to the rational straightline AB producing the straightline BC as breadth I say that BC is rational and commen surable in length with BA For let the square AD have been described on AB 301STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 AD is thus rational Def 104 And AC is also ratio nal DA is thus commensurable with AC And as DA is to AC so DB is to BC Prop 61 Thus DB is also commensurable in length with BC Prop 1011 And DB is equal to BA Thus AB is also commen surable in length with BC And AB is rational Thus BC is also rational and commensurable in length with AB Def 103 Thus if a rational area is applied to a rational straightline and so on ka Proposition 21 The rectangle contained by rational straightlines which are commensurable in square only is irrational and its squareroot is irrationallet it be called medial D B A C For let the rectangle AC be contained by the rational straightlines AB and BC which are commensurable in square only I say that AC is irrational and its square root is irrationallet it be called medial For let the square AD have been described on AB AD is thus rational Def 104 And since AB is incom mensurable in length with BC For they were assumed to be commensurable in square only And AB is equal to BD DB is thus also incommensurable in length with BC And as DB is to BC so AD is to AC Prop 61 Thus DA is incommensurable with AC Prop 1011 And DA is rational Thus AC is irrational Def 104 Hence its squareroot that is to say the squareroot of the square equal to it is also irrational Def 104let it be called medial Which is the very thing it was re quired to show Thus a medial straightline has a length expressible as k14 302STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 Lmma Lemma If there are two straightlines then as the rst is to the second so the square on the rst is to the rectangle contained by the two straightlines E D G F Let FE and EG be two straightlines I say that as FE is to EG so the square on FE is to the rectangle contained by FE and EG For let the square DF have been described on FE And let GD have been completed Therefore since as FE is to EG so FD is to DG Prop 61 and FD is the square on FE and DG the rectangle contained by DE and EGthat is to say the rectangle contained by FE and EGthus as FE is to EG so the square on FE is to the rectangle contained by FE and EG And also similarly as the rectangle contained by GE and EF is to the square on EFthat is to say as GD is to FDso GE is to EF Which is the very thing it was required to show kb Proposition 22 The square on a medial straightline being ap plied to a rational straightline produces as breadth a straightline which is rational and incommensurable in length with the straightline to which it is applied G A D B E C F Let A be a medial straightline and CB a rational straightline and let the rectangular area BD equal to the square on A have been applied to BC producing CD as breadth I say that CD is rational and incommen surable in length with CB For since A is medial the square on it is equal to a 303STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 rectangular area contained by rational straightlines which are commensurable in square only Prop 1021 Let the square on A be equal to GF And the square on A is also equal to BD Thus BD is equal to GF And BD is also equiangular with GF And for equal and equiangular parallelograms the sides about the equal an gles are reciprocally proportional Prop 614 Thus pro portionally as BC is to EG so EF is to CD And also as the square on BC is to the square on EG so the square on EF is to the square on CD Prop 622 And the square on CB is commensurable with the square on EG For they are each rational Thus the square on EF is also commensurable with the square on CD Prop 1011 And the square on EF is ratio nal Thus the square on CD is also rational Def 104 Thus CD is rational And since EF is incommensurable in length with EG For they are commensurable in square only And as EF is to EG so the square on EF is to the rectangle contained by FE and EG see previ ous lemma The square on EF is thus incommen surable with the rectangle contained by FE and EG Prop 1011 But the square on CD is commensu rable with the square on EF For they are rational in square And the rectangle contained by DC and CB is commensurable with the rectangle contained by FE and EG For they are both equal to the square on A Thus the square on CD is also incommensurable with the rectangle contained by DC and CB Prop 1013 And as the square on CD is to the rectangle con tained by DC and CB so DC is to CB see previous lemma Thus DC is incommensurable in length with CB Prop 1011 Thus CD is rational and incommen surable in length with CB Which is the very thing it was required to show Literally rational kg Proposition 23 A straightline commensurable with a medial straight line is medial Let A be a medial straightline and let B be com mensurable with A I say that B is also a medial staight line Let the rational straightline CD be set out and let the rectangular area CE equal to the square on A have been applied to CD producing ED as width ED is thus rational and incommensurable in length with CD Prop 1022 And let the rectangular area CF equal to the square on B have been applied to CD produc ing DF as width Therefore since A is commensurable with B the square on A is also commensurable with 304STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 the square on B But EC is equal to the square on A and CF is equal to the square on B Thus EC is com mensurable with CF And as EC is to CF so ED is to DF Prop 61 Thus ED is commensurable in length with DF Prop 1011 And ED is rational and incom mensurable in length with CD DF is thus also ratio nal Def 103 and incommensurable in length with DC Prop 1013 Thus CD and DF are rational and com mensurable in square only And the squareroot of a rect angle contained by rational straightlines which are commensurable in square only is medial Prop 1021 Thus the squareroot of the rectangle contained by CD and DF is medial And the square on B is equal to the rectangle contained by CD and DF Thus B is a me dial straightline F A B E D C Pri sma Corollary And it is clear from this that an area commensu rable with a medial area is medial A medial area is equal to the square on some medial straightline Hence a medial area is expressible as k12 kd Proposition 24 A rectangle contained by medial straightlines which are commensurable in length is medial For let the rectangle AC be contained by the medial straightlines AB and BC which are commensurable in length I say that AC is medial For let the square AD have been described on AB AD is thus medial see previous footnote And since AB is commensurable in length with BC and AB is equal to BD DB is thus also commensurable in length with BC Hence DA is also commensurable with AC Props 61 1011 And DA is medial Thus AC is also medial Prop 1023 corr Which is the very thing it was required to show 305STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 A B D C ke Proposition 25 The rectangle contained by medial straightlines which are commensurable in square only is either ra tional or medial L D A E M N B C G O F H K For let the rectangle AC be contained by the medial straightlines AB and BC which are commensurable in square only I say that AC is either rational or medial For let the squares AD and BE have been described on the straightlines AB and BC respectively AD and BE are thus each medial And let the rational straightline FG be laid out And let the rectangular parallelogram GH equal to AD have been applied to FG producing FH as breadth And let the rectangular parallelogram MK equal to AC have been applied to HM producing HK as breadth And nally let NL equal to BE have similarly been applied to KN pro ducing KL as breadth Thus FH HK and KL are in a straightline Therefore since AD and BE are each medial and AD is equal to GH and BE to NL GH and NL are thus each also medial And they are ap plied to the rational straightline FG FH and KL are thus each rational and incommensurable in length with FG Prop 1022 And since AD is commensurable with BE GH is thus also commensurable with NL And as 306STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 GH is to NL so FH is to KL Prop 61 Thus FH is commensurable in length with KL Prop 1011 Thus FH and KL are rational straightlines which are com mensurable in length Thus the rectangle contained by FH and KL is rational Prop 1019 And since DB is equal to BA and OB to BC thus as DB is to BC so AB is to BO But as DB is to BC so DA is to AC Props 61 And as AB is to BO so AC is to CO Prop 61 Thus as DA is to AC so AC is to CO And AD is equal to GH and AC to MK and CO to NL Thus as GH is to MK so MK is to NL Thus also as FH is to HK so HK is to KL Props 61 511 Thus the rectangle contained by FH and KL is equal to the square on HK Prop 617 And the rectangle contained by FH and KL is rational Thus the square on HK is also rational Thus HK is ratio nal And if it is commensurable in length with FG then HN is rational Prop 1019 And if it is incommensu rable in length with FG then KH and HM are rational straightlines which are commensurable in square only thus HN is medial Prop 1021 Thus HN is either ra tional or medial And HN is equal to AC Thus AC is either rational or medial Thus the by medial straightlines which are com mensurable in square only and so on k Proposition 26 A medial area does not exceed a medial area by a rational area K A D B E C G H F For if possible let the medial area AB exceed the medial area AC by the rational area DB And let the rational straightline EF be laid down And let the rectangular parallelogram FH equal to AB have been applied to to EF producing EH as breadth And let FG equal to AC have been cut off from FH Thus the remainder BD is equal to the remainder KH And DB is rational Thus KH is also rational Therefore since AB and AC are each medial and AB is equal to FH and AC to FG FH and FG are thus each also medial 307STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 And they are applied to the rational straightline EF Thus HE and EG are each rational and incommensu rable in length with EF Prop 1022 And since DB is rational and is equal to KH KH is thus also ratio nal And KH is applied to the rational straightline EF GH is thus rational and commensurable in length with EF Prop 1020 But EG is also rational and in commensurable in length with EF Thus EG is incom mensurable in length with GH Prop 1013 And as EG is to GH so the square on EG is to the rectan gle contained by EG and GH Prop 1013 lem Thus the square on EG is incommensurable with the rect angle contained by EG and GH Prop 1011 But the sum of the squares on EG and GH is commensurable with the square on EG For EG and GH are both rational And twice the rectangle contained by EG and GH is commensurable with the rectangle contained by EG and GH Prop 106 For the former is double the latter Thus the sum of the squares on EG and GH is incommensurable with twice the rectangle con tained by EG and GH Prop 1013 And thus the sum of the squares on EG and GH plus twice the rectan gle contained by EG and GH that is the square on EH Prop 24 is incommensurable with the sum of the squares on EG and GH Prop 1016 And the sum of the squares on EG and GH is rational Thus the square on EH is irrational Def 104 Thus EH is irrational Def 104 But it is also rational The very thing is impossible Thus a medial area does not exceed a medial area by a rational area Which is the very thing it was required to show In other words k k k kz Proposition 27 To nd two medial straightlines containing a ra tional area which are commensurable in square only C A B D Let the two rational straightlines A and B which are commensurable in square only be laid down And let Cthe mean proportional straightline to A and B 308STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 have been taken Prop 613 And let it be contrived that as A is to B so C is to D Prop 612 And since the rational straightlines A and B are commensurable in square only the rectangle con tained by A and Bthat is to say the square on C Prop 617is thus medial Prop 1021 Thus C is medial Prop 1021 And since as A is to B so C is to D and A and B are commensurable in square only C and D are thus also commensurable in square only Prop 1011 And C is medial Thus D is also medial Prop 1023 Thus C and D are medial straightlines which are commensurable in square only I say that they also contain a rational area For since as A is to B so C is to D thus alternately as A is to C so B is to D Prop 516 But as A is to C so C is to B And thus as C is to B so B is to D Prop 511 Thus the rectangle contained by C and D is equal to the square on B Prop 617 And the square on B is rational Thus the rectangle contained by C and D is also rational Thus two medial straightlines C and D con taining a rational area which are commensurable in square only have been found Which is the very thing it was required to show C and D have lengths k14 and k34 times that of A respectively where the length of B is k12 times that of A kh Proposition 28 To nd two medial straightlines containing a me dial area which are commensurable in square only C B D E A Let the three rational straightlines A B and C which are commensurable in square only be laid down And let D the mean proportional straightline to A and B have been taken Prop 613 And let it be con trived that as B is to C so D is to E Prop 612 Since the rational straightlines A and B are com mensurable in square only the rectangle contained by A and Bthat is to say the square on D Prop 617 is medial Prop 1021 Thus D is medial Prop 1021 And since B and C are commensurable in square only and as B is to C so D is to E D and E are thus com mensurable in square only Prop 1011 And D is me dial E is thus also medial Prop 1023 Thus D and E are medial straightlines which are commensurable in square only So I say that they also enclose a medial area For since as B is to C so D is to E thus 309STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 alternately as B is to D so C is to E Prop 516 And as B is to D so D is to A And thus as D is to A so C is to E Thus the rectangle contained by A and C is equal to the rectangle contained by D and E Prop 616 And the rectangle contained by A and C is medial Prop 1021 Thus the rectangle contained by D and E is also medial Thus two medial straightlines D and E con taining a medial area which are commensurable in square only have been found Which is the very thing it was required to show D and E have lengths k14 and k12k14 times that of A respectively where the lengths of B and C are k12 and k12 times that of A respectively Lmma a Lemma I To nd two square numbers such that the sum of them is also square D A B C Let the two numbers AB and BC be laid down And let them be either both even or both odd And since if an even number is subtracted from an even number or if an odd number is subtracted from an odd num ber then the remainder is even Props 924 926 the remainder AC is thus even Let AC have been cut in half at D And let AB and BC also be either similar plane numbers or square numberswhich are them selves also similar plane numbers Thus the num ber created from multiplying AB and BC plus the square on CD is equal to the square on BD Prop 26 And the number created from multiplying AB and BC is squareinasmuch as it was shown that if two similar plane numbers make some number by mul tiplying one another then the number so created is square Prop 91 Thus two square numbers have been foundnamely the number created from mul tiplying AB and BC and the square on CDwhich when added together make the square on BD And it is clear that two square numbers have again been foundnamely the square on BD and the square on CDsuch that their differencenamely the rectangle contained by AB and BCis square whenever AB and BC are similar plane numbers But when they are not similar plane numbers two square numbers have been foundnamely the square on BD and the square on DCbetween which the differencenamely the rectangle contained by AB and BCis not square Which is the very thing it was required to show 310STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 Lmma b Lemma II To nd two square numbers such that the sum of them is not square H A B D C F E G For let the number created from multiplying AB and BC as we said be square And let CA be even And let CA have been cut in half at D So it is clear that the square number created from multiplying AB and BC plus the square on CD is equal to the square on BD see previous lemma Let the unit DE have been subtracted from BD Thus the number created from multiplying AB and BC plus the square on CE is less than the square on BD I say therefore that the square number created from multiplying AB and BC plus the square on CE is not square For if it is square it is either equal to the square on BE or less than the square on BE but cannot any more be greater than the square on BE lest the unit be divided First of all if possible let the number created from multiplying AB and BC plus the square on CE be equal to the square on BE And let GA be double the unit DE Therefore since the whole of AC is double the whole of CD of which AG is double DE the remain der GC is thus double the remainder EC Thus GC has been cut in half at E Thus the number created from multiplying GB and BC plus the square on CE is equal to the square on BE Prop 26 But the num ber created from multiplying AB and BC plus the square on CE was also assumed to be equal to the square on BE Thus the number created from multi plying GB and BC plus the square on CE is equal to the number created from multiplying AB and BC plus the square on CE And subtracting the square on CE from both AB is inferred to be equal to GB The very thing is absurd Thus the number created from multiplying AB and BC plus the square on CE is not equal to the square on BE So I say that it is not less than the square on BE either For if possible let it be equal to the square on BF And let HA be dou ble DF And it can again be inferred that HC is double CF Hence CH has also been cut in half at F And on account of this the number created from multiplying HB and BC plus the square on FC becomes equal to the square on BF Prop 26 And the number cre ated from multiplying AB and BC plus the square on CE was also assumed to be equal to the square on BF Hence the number created from multiplying HB and BC plus the square on CF will also be equal to the number created from multiplying AB and BC 311STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 plus the square on CE The very thing is absurd Thus the number created from multiplying AB and BC plus the square on CE is not equal to less than the square on BE And it was shown that is it not equal to the square on BE either Thus the number created from multiplying AB and BC plus the square on CE is not square Which is the very thing it was required to show kj Proposition 29 To nd two rational straightlines which are com mensurable in square only such that the square on the greater is larger than the square on the lesser by the square on some straightline which is commensurable in length with the greater F E D A B C For let some rational straightline AB be laid down and two square numbers CD and DE such that the dif ference between them CE is not square Prop 1028 lem I And let the semicircle AFB have been drawn on AB And let it be contrived that as DC is to CE so the square on BA is to the square on AF Prop 106 corr And let FB have been joined Therefore since as the square on BA is to the square on AF so DC is to CE the square on BA thus has to the square on AF the ratio which the number DC has to the number CE Thus the square on BA is commensurable with the square on AF Prop 106 And the square on AB is rational Def 104 Thus the square on AF is also ratio nal Thus AF is also rational And since DC does not have to CE the ratio which some square num ber has to some square number the square on BA thus does not have to the square on AF the ra tio which some square number has to some square number either Thus AB is incommensurable in length with AF Prop 109 Thus the rational straightlines BA and AF are commensurable in square only And since as DC is to CE so the square on BA is to the square on AF thus via conversion as CD is to DE so the square on AB is to the square on 312STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 BF Props 519 corr 331 147 And CD has to DE the ratio which some square number has to some square number Thus the square on AB also has to the square on BF the ratio which some square number has to some square number AB is thus commensu rable in length with BF Prop 109 And the square on AB is equal to the sum of the squares on AF and FB Prop 147 Thus the square on AB is greater than the square on AF by the square on BF which is commensurable in length with AB Thus two rational straightlines BA and AF com mensurable in square only have been found such that the square on the greater AB is larger than the square on the lesser AF by the square on BF which is com mensurable in length with AB Which is the very thing it was required to show BA and AF have lengths 1 and 1 k2 times that of AB respectively where k p DECD l Proposition 30 To nd

semicircle AFB have been drawn on AB And let it be contrived that as DC is to CE so the square on BA is to the square on AF Prop 106 corr And let FB have been joined So similarly to the proposition before this we can show that BA and AF are rational straightlines which are commensurable in square only And since as DC is to CE so the square on BA is to the square on AF thus via conversion as CD is to DE so the square on AB is to the square on BF Props 519 corr 331 147 And CD does not have to DE the ratio which some square number has to some square number 313STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 Thus the square on AB does not have to the square on BF the ratio which some square number has to some square number either Thus AB is incommensu rable in length with BF Prop 109 And the square on AB is greater than the square on AF by the square on FB Prop 147 which is incommensurable in length with AB Thus AB and AF are rational straightlines which are commensurable in square only and the square on AB is greater than the square on AF by the square on FB which is incommensurable in length with AB Which is the very thing it was required to show AB and AF have lengths 1 and 1 1 k2 times that of AB

on the greater A is larger than the square on the lesser B by the square on some straightline commensurable in length with A Prop 1029 And let the square on C be equal to the rectangle contained by A and B And the rectangle contained by A and B is medial Prop 1021 Thus the square on C is also medial Thus C is also medial Prop 1021 And let the rect angle contained by C and D be equal to the square on B And the square on B is rational Thus the rectangle contained by C and D is also rational And since as A is to B so the rectangle contained by A and B is to the square on B Prop 1021 lem but the square on C is equal to the rectangle contained by A and B and the rectangle contained by C and D to the square on B thus as A is to B so the square on C is to the rectangle contained by C and D And as the square on C is to the rectangle contained by 314STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 C and D so C is to D Prop 1021 lem And thus as A is to B so C is to D And A is commensurable in square only with B Thus C is also commensurable in square only with D Prop 1011 And C is medial Thus D is also medial Prop 1023 And since as A is to B so C is to D and the square on A is greater than the square on B by the square on some straightline commensurable in length with A the square on C is thus also greater than the square on D by the square on some straightline commensurable in length with C Prop 1014 Thus two medial straightlines C and D commen surable in square only and containing a rational area have been found And the square on C is greater than the square on D by the square on some straightline commensurable in length with C So similarly the proposition can also be demon strated for some straightline incommensurable in length with C provided that the square on A is greater than the square on B by the square on some straightline incommensurable in length with A Prop 1030 C and D have lengths 1 k214 and 1 k234 times that of A respectively where k is dened in the footnote to Prop 1029 C and D would have lengths 11 k214 and 11 k234 times that of A respectively where k is dened in the footnote to Prop 1030 lb Proposition 32 To nd two medial straightlines commensurable in square only and containing a medial area such that the square on the greater is larger than the square on the lesser by the square on some straightline com mensurable in length with the greater C E D A B Let three rational straightlines A B and C com mensurable in square only be laid out such that the square on A is greater than the square on C by the square on some straightline commensurable in length with A Prop 1029 And let the square on D be equal to the rectangle contained by A and B Thus the square on D is medial Thus D is also me dial Prop 1021 And let the rectangle contained by D and E be equal to the rectangle contained by B and C And since as the rectangle contained by A and B is to the rectangle contained by B and C so A is to C Prop 1021 lem but the square on D is equal to the rectangle contained by A and B and the rectangle 315STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 contained by D and E to the rectangle contained by B and C thus as A is to C so the square on D is to the rectangle contained by D and E And as the square on D is to the rectangle contained by D and E so D is to E Prop 1021 lem And thus as A is to C so D is to E And A is commensurable in square only with C Thus D is also commensurable in square only with E Prop 1011 And D is me dial Thus E is also medial Prop 1023 And since as A is to C so D is to E and the square on A is greater than the square on C by the square on some straightline commensurable in length with A the square on D will thus also be greater than the square on E by the square on some straightline commen surable in length with D Prop 1014 So I also say that the rectangle contained by D and E is medial For since the rectangle contained by B and C is equal to the rectangle contained by D and E and the rect angle contained by B and C is medial for B and C are rational straightlines which are commensurable in square only Prop 1021 the rectangle contained by D and E is thus also medial Thus two medial straightlines D and E commen surable in square only and containing a medial area have been found such that the square on the greater is larger than the square on the lesser by the square on some straightline commensurable in length with the greater So similarly the proposition can again also be demonstrated for some straightline incommensurable in length with the greater provided that the square on A is greater than the square on C by the square on some straightline incommensurable in length with A Prop 1030 D and E have lengths k14 and k14 1 k2 times that of A respectively where the length of B is k12 times that of A and k is dened in the footnote to Prop 1029 D and E would have lengths k14 and k14 1 k2 times that of A respectively where the length of B is k12 times that of A and k is dened in the footnote to Prop 1030 Lmma Lemma Let ABC be a rightangled triangle having the an gle A a rightangle And let the perpendicular AD have been drawn I say that the rectangle contained by CBD is equal to the square on BA and the rectangle con tained by BCD is equal to the square on CA and the rectangle contained by BD and DC is equal to the square on AD and further the rectangle contained by BC and AD is equal to the rectangle contained by BA and AC 316STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 And rst of all let us prove that the rectangle con tained by CBD is equal to the square on BA C A B D For since AD has been drawn from the rightangle in a rightangled triangle perpendicular to the base ABD and ADC are thus triangles which are similar to the whole ABC and to one another Prop 68 And since triangle ABC is similar to triangle ABD thus as CB is to BA so BA is to BD Prop 64 Thus the rectan gle contained by CBD is equal to the square on AB Prop 617 So for the same reasons the rectangle contained by BCD is also equal to the square on AC And since if a straightline is drawn from the right angle in a rightangled triangle perpendicular to the base the straightline so drawn is the mean propor tional to the pieces of the base Prop 68 corr thus as BD is to DA so AD is to DC Thus the rectangle contained by BD and DC is equal to the square on DA Prop 617 I also say that the rectangle contained by BC and AD is equal to the rectangle contained by BA and AC For since as we said ABC is similar to ABD thus as BC is to CA so BA is to AD Prop 64 Thus the rectan gle contained by BC and AD is equal to the rectangle contained by BA and AC Prop 616 Which is the very thing it was required to show lg Proposition 33 To nd two straightlines which are incommensu rable in square making the sum of the squares

semicircle AFB have been drawn on AB And let EF have been drawn at rightangles to AB And let AF and FB have been joined D A B G E Z D A B C E F And since AB and BC are two unequal straight lines and the square on AB is greater than the square on BC by the square on some straightline which is incommensurable in length with AB And a paral lelogram equal to one quarter of the square on BC that is to say equal to the square on half of itand falling short by a square gure has been applied to AB and makes the rectangle contained by AEB AE is thus incommensurable in length with EB Prop 1018 And as AE is to EB so the rectangle contained by BA and AE is to the rectangle contained by AB and BE And the rectangle contained by BA and AE is equal to the square on AF and the rectangle contained by AB and BE to the square on BF Prop 1032 lem The square on AF is thus incommensurable with the square on FB Prop 1011 Thus AF and FB are in commensurable in square And since AB is rational the square on AB is also rational Hence the sum of the squares on AF and FB is also rational Prop 147 And again since the rectangle contained by AE and EB is equal to the square on EF and the rectangle contained by AE and EB was assumed to be equal to the square on BD FE is thus equal to BD Thus BC is double FE And hence the rectangle contained by AB and BC is commensurable with the rectangle con tained by AB and EF Prop 106 And the rectan gle contained by AB and BC is medial Prop 1021 Thus the rectangle contained by AB and EF is also medial Prop 1023 corr And the rectangle contained by AB and EF is equal to the rectangle contained by AF and FB Prop 1032 lem Thus the rectangle con tained by AF and FB is also medial And the sum of the squares on them was also shown to be rational Thus the two straightlines AF and FB which are incommensurable in square have been found making the sum of the squares on them rational and the rectan gle contained by them medial Which is the very thing it was required to show

falling short by a square gure have been applied to AB and let it be the rectangle contained by AFB Prop 628 Thus AF is incommensurable in length with FB Prop 1018 And let FD have been drawn from F at rightangles to AB And let AD and DB have been joined Since AF is incommensurable in length with FB the rectangle contained by BA and AF is thus also incommensurable with the rectangle contained by AB and BF Prop 1011 And the rectangle contained by BA and AF is equal to the square on AD and the rectangle contained by AB and BF to the square on DB Prop 1032 lem Thus the square on AD is also incommensurable with the square on DB And since the square on AB is medial the sum of the squares on AD and DB is thus also medial Props 331 147 And since BC is double DF see previous proposition the rectangle contained by AB and BC is thus also double the rectangle contained by AB and FD And the rectangle contained by AB and BC is rational Thus the rectangle contained by AB and FD is also rational Prop 106 Def 104 And the rectangle con tained by AB and FD is equal to the rectangle con tained by AD and DB Prop 1032 lem And hence the rectangle contained by AD and DB is rational Thus two

above proposition And since AF is incommensurable in length with FB Prop 1018 AD is also incommensurable in square with DB Prop 1011 And since the square on AB is medial the sum of the squares on AD and DB is thus also medial Props 331 147 And since the rect angle contained by AF and FB is equal to the square on each of BE and DF BE is thus equal to DF Thus BC is double FD And hence the rectangle

into the straightlines of which they are the sum and which pro duce the prescribed types after setting forth the follow ing lemma C A D E B Let the straightline AB be laid out and let the whole straightline have been cut into unequal parts at each of the points C and D And let AC be assumed to be greater than DB I say that the sum of the squares on AC and CB is greater than the sum of the squares on AD and DB For let AB have been cut in half at E And since AC is greater than DB let DC have been subtracted from both Thus the remainder AD is greater than the remainder CB And AE is equal to EB Thus DE is less than EC Thus points C and D are not equally far from the point of bisection And since the rectangle contained by AC and CB plus the square on EC is equal to the square on EB Prop 25 but moreover the rectan gle contained by AD and DB plus the square on DE is also equal to the square on EB Prop 25 the rect angle contained by AC and CB plus the square on EC is thus equal to the rectangle contained by AD and DB plus the square on DE And of these the square on DE is less than the square on EC And thus the 326STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 remaining rectangle contained by AC and CB is less than the rectangle contained by AD and DB And hence twice the rectangle contained by AC and CB is less than twice the rectangle contained by AD and DB And thus the remaining sum of the

straightline can be divided into its compo nent terms at one point only C A D B Let AB be a binomial straightline which has been divided into its component terms at C AC and CB are thus rational straightlines which are commensurable in square only Prop 1036 I say that AB cannot be divided at another point into two rational straightlines which are commensurable in square only For if possible let it also have been divided at D such that AD and DB are also rational straightlines which are commensurable in square only So it is clear that AC is not the same as DB For if possible let it be the same So AD will also be the same as CB And as AC will be to CB so BD will be to DA And AB will thus also be divided at D in the same manner as the division at C The very opposite was assumed Thus AC is not the same as DB So on account of this points C and D are not equally far from the point of bisection Thus by whatever amount the sum of the squares on AC and CB differs from the sum of the squares on AD and DB twice the rectangle contained by AD and DB also differs from twice the rectangle contained by AC and CB by this same amounton account of both the sum of the squares on AC and CB plus twice the rectangle contained by AC and CB and the sum of the squares on AD and DB plus twice the rectangle contained by AD and DB being equal to the square on AB Prop 24 But the sum of the squares on AC and CB differs from the sum of the squares on AD and DB by a rational area For they are both rational areas Thus twice the rectangle contained by AD and DB also differs from twice the rectangle contained by AC and CB by a rational area despite both being medial areas Prop 1021 The very thing is absurd For a medial area cannot exceed a medial area by a rational area Prop 1026

also medial straightlines commensurable in square only and containing a ratio nal area Since therefore by whatever amount twice the rectangle contained by AD and DB differs from twice the rectangle contained by AC and CB the sum of the squares on AC and CB differs from the sum of the squares on AD and DB by this same amount Prop 1041 lem And twice the rectangle contained by AD and DB differs from twice the rectangle con tained by AC and CB by a rational area For they are both rational areas The sum of the squares on AC and CB thus differs from the sum of the squares on AD and DB by a rational area despite both being medial areas The very thing is absurd Prop 1026 Thus a rst bimedial straightline cannot be divided into its component terms at different points Thus it can be so divided at one point only Which is the very thing it was required to show In other words k14 k34 k14 k34 has only one solution ie k k md Proposition 44 A second bimedial straightline can be divided into its component terms at one point only Let AB be a second bimedial straightline which has been divided at C so that AC and BC are medial straightlines commensurable in square only and containing a medial area Prop 1038 So it is clear that C is not located at the point of bisection since AC and BC are not commensurable in length I say that AB cannot be so divided at another point 328STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 G A D B E N K C F H L M For if possible let it also have been so divided at D so that AC is not the same as DB but AC is by hypothesis greater So it is clear that the sum of the squares on AD and DB is also less than the sum of the squares on AC and CB as we showed above Prop 1041 lem And AD and DB are medial straightlines commensurable in square only and containing a medial area And let the rational straight line EF be laid down And let the rectangular paral lelogram EK equal to the square on AB have been applied to EF And let EG equal to the sum of the squares on AC and CB have been cut off from EK Thus the remainder HK is equal to twice the rectan gle contained by AC and CB Prop 24 So again let EL equal to the sum of the squares on AD and DBwhich was shown to be less than the sum of the squares on AC and CBhave been cut off from EK And thus the remainder MK is equal to twice the rectangle contained by AD and DB And since the sum of the squares on AC and CB is medial EG is thus also medial And it is applied to the ratio nal straightline EF Thus EH is rational and incom mensurable in length with EF Prop 1022 So for the same reasons HN is also rational and incommensu rable in length with EF And since AC and CB are me dial straightlines which are commensurable in square only AC is thus incommensurable in length with CB And as AC is to CB so the square on AC is to the rectangle contained by AC and CB Prop 1021 lem Thus the square on AC is incommensurable with the rectangle contained by AC and CB Prop 1011 But the sum of the squares on AC and CB is commensu rable with the square on AC For AC and CB are com mensurable in square Prop 1015 And twice the rect angle contained by AC and CB is commensurable with the rectangle contained by AC and CB Prop 106 And thus the sum of the squares on AC and CB is in commensurable with twice the rectangle contained by AC and CB Prop 1013 But EG is equal to the sum of the squares on AC and CB and HK equal to twice the rectangle contained by AC and CB Thus EG is incommensurable with HK Hence EH is also incom 329STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 mensurable in length with HN Props 61 1011 And they are rational straightlines Thus EH and HN are rational straightlines which are commensurable in square only And if two rational straightlines which are commensurable in square only are added together then the whole straightline is that irrational called bi nomial Prop 1036 Thus EN is a binomial straight line which has been divided into its component terms at H So according to the same reasoning EM and MN can be shown to be rational straightlines which are commensurable in square only And EN will thus be a binomial straightline which has been divided into its component terms at the different points H and M which is absurd Prop 1042 And EH is not the same as MN since the sum of the squares on AC and CB is greater than the sum of the squares on AD and DB But the sum of the squares on AD and DB is greater than twice the rectangle contained by AD and DB Prop 1059 lem Thus the sum of the squares on AC and CBthat is to say EGis also much greater than twice the rectangle contained by AD and DB that is to say MK Hence EH is also greater than MN Prop 61 Thus EH is not the same as MN Which is the very thing it was required to show In other words k14 k12k14 k14 k12k14 has only one solution ie k k

incommensurable in square making the sum of the squares on AC and CB rational and the rectangle contained by AC and CD medial Prop 1039 I say that AB cannot be so di vided at another point For if possible let it also have been divided at D such that AD and DB are also incommensurable in square making the sum of the squares on AD and DB ratio nal and the rectangle contained by them medial And since by whatever amount the sum of the squares on AC and CB differs from the sum of the squares on AD and DB twice the rectangle contained by AD and DB also differs from twice the rectangle contained by AC and CB by this same amount But the sum of the squares on AC and CB exceeds the sum of the squares on AD and DB by a rational area For they are both rational areas Thus twice the rectangle 330STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 contained by AD and DB also exceeds twice the rect angle contained by AC and CB by a rational area despite both being medial areas The very thing is impossible Prop 1026 Thus a major straightline cannot be divided into its component terms at differ ent points Thus it can only be so divided at the same point Which is the very thing it was required to show In other

point only C A D B Let AB be the squareroot of a rational plus a medial area which has been divided at C so that AC and CB are incommensurable in square making the sum of the squares on AC and CB medial and twice the rectan gle contained by AC and CB rational Prop 1040 I say that AB cannot be so divided at another point For if possible let it also have been divided at D so that AD and DB are also incommensurable in square making the sum of the squares on AD and DB medial and twice the rectangle contained by AD and DB ra tional Therefore since by whatever amount twice the rectangle contained by AC and CB differs from twice the rectangle contained by AD and DB the sum of the squares on AD and DB also differs from the sum of the squares on AC and CB by this same amount And twice the rectangle contained by AC and CB ex ceeds twice the rectangle contained by AD and DB by a rational area The sum of the squares on AD and DB thus also exceeds the sum of the squares on AC and CB by a rational area despite both being medial areas The very thing is impossible Prop 1026 Thus the squareroot of a rational plus a medial area cannot be divided into its component terms at different points Thus it can be so divided at one point only Which is the very thing it was required to show In other words q 1 k212 k2 1 k2 q 1 k212 k2 1 k2 q 1 k212 k2 1 k2 q 1 k212 k2 1 k2 has only one

be the squareroot of the sum of two me dial areas which has been divided at C such that AC and CB are incommensurable in square making the sum of the squares on AC and CB medial and the rect angle contained by AC and CB medial and moreover incommensurable with the sum of the squares on AC and CB Prop 1041 I say that AB cannot be divided at another point fullling the prescribed conditions For if possible let it have been divided at D such that AC is again manifestly not the same as DB but AC is by hypothesis greater And let the rational straightline EF be laid down And let EG equal to the sum of the squares on AC and CB and HK equal to twice the rectangle contained by AC and CB have been applied to EF Thus the whole of EK is equal to the square on AB Prop 24 So again let EL equal to the sum of the squares on AD and DB have been applied to EF Thus the remaindertwice the rectangle contained by AD and DBis equal to the remainder MK And since the sum of the squares on AC and CB was assumed to be medial EG is also medial And it is applied to the rational straightline EF HE is thus rational and incommensurable in length with EF Prop 1022 So for the same reasons HN is also rational and incom mensurable in length with EF And since the sum of the squares on AC and CB is incommensurable with twice the rectangle contained by AC and CB EG is thus also incommensurable with GN Hence EH is also incommensurable with HN Props 61 1011 And they are both rational straightlines Thus EH and HN are rational straightlines which are commensu rable in square only Thus EN is a binomial straight line which has been divided into its component terms at H Prop 1036 So similarly we can show that it has also been so divided at M And EH is not the same as MN Thus a binomial straightline has been divided into its component terms at different points The very thing is absurd Prop 1042 Thus the squareroot of the sum of two medial areas cannot be divided into 332STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 its

let the whole straightline be called a rst bino mial straightline 6 And if the lesser term is commensurable in length with the rational straightline previously laid out then let the whole straightline be called a second binomial straightline 7 And if neither of the terms is commensurable in length with the rational straightline previously laid out then let the whole straightline be called a third

the ratio which some number has to some number Hence the square on EF is commensurable with the square on FG Prop 106 And EF is ra tional Thus FG is also rational And since BA does not have to AC the ratio which some square number has to some square number thus the square on EF does not have to the square on FG the ratio which some square number has to some square number either Thus EF is

D does not have to AB the ratio which some square number has to some square number the square on E does not have to the square on FG the ratio which some square number has to some square number either E is thus incommensurable in length with FG Prop 109 So again let it have been contrived that as the number BA is to AC so the square on FG is to the square on GH Prop 106 corr Thus the square on FG

AE and that AE is commensurable in length with the rational straightline AB rst laid out Def 105 So let ED have been cut in half at point F And since the square on AE is greater than the square on ED by the square on some straightline commensurable in length with AE thus if a rectangle equal to the fourth part of the square on the lesser termthat is to say the square on EFfalling short by a square gure is applied to the greater term AE then it divides it into terms which are commensurable in length Prop 1017 Therefore let the rectangle contained by AG and GE equal to the square on EF have been

as AH is to EL so EL is 342STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 to KG Prop 61 Thus EL is the mean proportional to AH and GK But AH is equal to SN and GK is equal to NQ EL is thus the mean proportional to SN and NQ And MR is also the mean proportional to the same namely SN and NQ Prop 1053 lem EL is thus equal to MR Hence it is also equal to PO Prop 143 And AH plus GK is equal to SN plus NQ Thus the whole

also commensurable in length with each of AG and GE Prop 1015 And AE was also assumed to be commensurable in length with AB Thus AG and GE are also commensurable in length with AB Prop 1012 And AB is

AG is thus also incommensurable in length with EF Prop 1013 Hence AH is also incommensurable with EL Props 61 1011 But AH is equal to SN and EL to MR Thus SN is also incommensurable with MR But as SN is to MR so PN is to NR Prop 61 PN is thus incommensurable in length with NR Prop 1011 And PN is equal to MN and NR to NO Thus MN is incommensurable in length with NO And the square on MN is commensurable with the square on NO and each is rational MN and NO are thus rational straightlines which are com mensurable in square only Thus MO is both a binomial straightline Prop 1036 and the squareroot of AC Which is the very thing it was required to show If the rational straightline has unit length then this proposition states that the squareroot of a rst binomial straightline is a binomial straight line ie a rst binomial straightline has a length k k 1 k 2 whose squareroot can be written 1 k where p k 1 k2 and k 1 k1 k This is the length of a binomial straightline see Prop 1036 since is rational ne Proposition 55 If an area is contained by a rational straightline and a second binomial straightline then the squareroot of the area is the irrational straightline which is called rst bimedial 343STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 Q A B R N O P H G C D M E K F L S For let the area ABCD be contained by the rational straightline AB and by the second binomial straight line AD I say that the squareroot of area AC is a rst bimedial straightline For since AD is a second binomial straightline let it have been divided into its component terms at E such that AE is the greater term Thus AE and ED are ratio nal straightlines which are commensurable in square only and the square on AE is greater than the square on ED by the square on some straightline commen surable in length with AE and the lesser term ED is commensurable in length with AB Def 106 Let ED have been cut in half at F And let the rectan gle contained by AGE equal to the square on EF have been applied to AE falling short by a square g ure AG is thus commensurable in length with GE Prop 1017 And let GH EK and FL have been drawn through points G E and F respectively par allel to AB and CD And let the square SN equal to the parallelogram AH have been constructed and the square NQ equal to GK And let MN be laid down so as to be straighton to NO Thus RN is also straighton to NP And let the square SQ have been completed So it is clear from what has been previously demonstrated Prop 1053 lem that MR is the mean proportional to SN and NQ and is equal to EL and that MO is the squareroot of the area AC So we must show that MO is a rst bimedial straightline Since AE is incommensurable in length with ED and ED is commensurable in length with AB AE is thus incommensurable in length with AB Prop 1013 And since AG is commensurable in length with EG AE is also commensurable in length with each of AG and GE Prop 1015 But AE is in commensurable in length with AB Thus AG and GE are also both incommensurable in length with AB Prop 1013 Thus BA AG and BA and GE are pairs of rational straightlines which are commensu rable in square only And hence each of AH and GK is a medial area Prop 1021 Hence each of SN and NQ is also a medial area Thus MN and NO are medial straightlines And since AG is commen surable in length with GE AH is also commensurable 344STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 with GKthat is to say SN with NQthat is to say the square on MN with the square on NO hence MN and NO are commensurable in square Props 61 1011 And since AE is incommensurable in length with ED but AE is commensurable in length with AG and ED commensurable in length with EF AG is thus incommensurable in length with EF Prop 1013 Hence AH is also incommensurable with ELthat is to say SN with MRthat is to say PN with NRthat is to say MN is incommensurable in length with NO Props 61 1011 But MN and NO have also been shown to be medial straightlines which are commensu rable in square Thus MN and NO are medial straight lines which are commensurable in square only So I say that they also contain a rational area For since DE was assumed to be commensurable in length with each of AB and EF EF is thus also commensurable with EK Prop 1012 And they are each rational Thus EL that is to say MRis rational Prop 1019 And MR is the rectangle contained by MNO And if two medial straightlines commensurable in square only which contain a rational area are added together then the whole is that irrational straightline which is called rst bimedial Prop 1037 Thus MO is a rst bimedial straightline Which is the very thing it was required to show If the rational straightline has unit length then this proposition states that the squareroot of a second binomial straightline is a rst bimedial straightline ie a second binomial straightline has a length k 1 k 2 k whose squareroot can be written k14 k34 where p k2 1 k1 k and k 1 k1 k This is the length of a rst bimedial straightline see Prop 1037 since is rational n Proposition 56 If an area is contained by a rational straightline and a third binomial straightline then the squareroot of the area is the irrational straightline which is called second bimedial Q A B R N O P H G C D M E K F L S For let the area ABCD be contained by the rational straightline AB and by the third binomial straight line AD which has been divided into its component terms at E of which AE is the greater I say that the squareroot of area AC is the irrational straightline which is called second bimedial 345STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 For let the same construction be made as previously And since AD is a third binomial straightline AE and ED are thus rational straightlines which are commen surable in square only and the square on AE is greater than the square on ED by the square on some straightline commensurable in length with AE and neither of AE and ED is commensurable in length with AB Def 107 So similarly to that which has been previously demonstrated we can show that MO is the squareroot of area AC and MN and NO are medial straightlines which are commensurable in square only Hence MO is bimedial So we must show that it is also second bimedial And since DE is incommensurable in length with ABthat is to say with EKand DE is commensu rable in length with EF EF is thus incommensurable in length with EK Prop 1013 And they are both rational straightlines Thus FE and EK are rational straightlines which are commensurable in square only ELthat is to say MRis thus medial Prop 1021 And it is contained by MNO Thus the rectangle con tained by MNO is medial Thus MO is a second bimedial straightline Prop 1038 Which is the very thing it was required to show If the rational straightline has unit length then this proposition states that the squareroot of a third

the area is the irrational straightline which is called major Q A B R N O P H G C D M E K F L S For let the area AC be contained by the rational straightline AB and the fourth binomial straightline AD which has been divided into its component terms at E of which let AE be the greater I say that the square root of AC is the irrational straightline which is called major For since AD is a fourth binomial straightline AE and ED are thus rational straightlines which are com 346STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 mensurable in square only and the square on AE is greater than the square on ED by the square on some straightline incommensurable in length with AE and AE is commensurable in length with AB Def 108 Let DE have been cut in half at F and let the parallelogram contained by AG and GE equal to the square on EF and falling short by a square gure have been applied to AE AG is thus incommensurable in length with GE Prop 1018 Let GH EK and FL have been drawn parallel to AB and let the rest of the construction have been made the same as the proposi tion before this So it is clear that MO is the squareroot of area AC So we must show that MO is the irrational straightline which is called major Since AG is incommensurable in length with EG AH is also incommensurable with GKthat is to say SN with NQ Props 61 1011 Thus MN and NO are incommensurable in square And since AE is commensu rable in length with AB AK is rational Prop 1019 And it is equal to the sum of the squares on MN and NO Thus the sum of the squares on MN and NO is also rational And since DE is incommensu rable in length with AB Prop 1013that is to say with EKbut DE is commensurable in length with EF EF is thus incommensurable in length with EK Prop 1013 Thus EK and EF are rational straight lines which are commensurable in square only LE that is to say MRis thus medial Prop 1021 And it is contained by MN and NO The rectangle contained by MN and NO is thus medial And the sum of the squares on MN and NO is rational and MN and NO are incommensurable in square And if two straight lines which are incommensurable in square making the sum of the squares on them rational and the rectangle contained by them medial are added together then the whole is the irrational straightline which is called ma jor Prop 1039 Thus MO is the irrational straightline which is called major And it is the squareroot of area AC Which is the very thing it was required to show If the rational straightline has unit length then this proposition states that the squareroot of a fourth binomial straightline is a major straight line ie a fourth binomial straightline has a length k 1 11 k whose squareroot can be written q 1 k1 k 2122 q 1 k1 k 2122 where k and k 2 k This is the length of a major straightline see Prop 1039

Thus MN and NO are incommensurable in square And since AD is a fth binomial straightline and ED is its lesser seg ment ED is thus commensurable in length with AB Def 109 But AE is incommensurable in length with ED Thus AB is also incommensurable in length with AE BA and AE are rational straightlines which are commensurable in square only Prop 1013 Thus AKthat is to say the sum of the squares on MN and NOis medial Prop 1021 And since DE is commensurable in length with ABthat is to say with EKbut DE is commensurable in length with EF EF is thus also commensurable in length with EK Prop 1012 And EK is rational Thus ELthat is to say MRthat is to say the rectangle contained by MNOis also rational Prop 1019 MN and NO are thus straightlines which are incommensurable in square making the sum

squareroot of the sum of two medial areas For let the same construction be made as that shown previously So it is clear that MO is the squareroot of AC and that MN is incommensurable in square with NO And since EA is incommensurable in length with AB Def 1010 EA and AB are thus rational straight lines which are commensurable in square only Thus AKthat is to say the sum of the squares on MN and NOis

EL Props 61 1011 But AK is the sum of the squares on MN and NO and EL is the rectangle contained by MNO Thus the sum of the squares on MNO is incommensurable with the rect angle contained by MNO And each of them is medial And MN and NO are incommensurable in square Thus MO is the squareroot of the sum of two me dial areas Prop 1041 And it is the squareroot of AC Which is the very thing it was

C A B D Let AB be a straightline and let it have been cut unequally at C and let AC be greater than CB I say that the sum of the squares on AC and CB is greater than twice the rectangle contained by AC and CB For let AB have been cut in half at D Therefore since a straightline has been cut into equal parts at D and into unequal parts at C the rectangle contained by AC and CB plus the square on CD is thus equal to the square on AD Prop 25 Hence the rectangle contained by AC and CB is less than the square on AD Thus twice the rectangle contained by AC and CB is less than double the square on AD But the sum of the squares on AC and CB is double the sum of the squares on AD and DC Prop 29 Thus the sum of the squares on AC and CB is greater than twice the rectangle contained by AC and CB Which is the very thing it was required to show x Proposition 60 The square on a binomial straightline applied to a rational straightline produces as breadth a rst bino mial straightline H B A L M N K D E C

allel to each of ML and GF MO and NF are thus each equal to once the rectangle contained by ACB And since AB is a binomial straightline having been divided into its component terms at C AC and CB are thus rational straightlines which are commensurable in square only Prop 1036 Thus the squares on AC and CB are rational and commensurable with one an other And hence the sum of the squares on AC and CB is rational Prop 1015 and is equal to DL Thus DL is rational And it is applied to the rational straight line DE DM is thus rational and commensurable in length with DE Prop 1020 Again since AC and CB are rational straightlines which are commensurable in square only twice the rectangle contained by AC and CBthat is to say MFis thus medial Prop 1021 And it is applied to the rational straightline ML MG is thus also rational and incommensurable in length with MLthat is to say with DE Prop 1022 And MD is also rational and commensurable in length with DE Thus DM is incommensurable in length with MG Prop 1013 And they are rational DM and MG are thus rational straightlines which are commensurable in square only Thus DG is a binomial straightline Prop 1036 So we must show that it is also a rst binomial straightline Since the rectangle contained by ACB is the mean proportional to the squares on AC and CB Prop 1053 lem MO is thus also the mean propor tional to DH and KL Thus as DH is to MO so MO is to KLthat is to say as DK is to MN so MN is to MK Prop 61 Thus the rectan gle contained by DK and KM is equal to the square on MN Prop 617 And since the square on AC is commensurable with the square on CB DH is also commensurable with KL Hence DK is also commensu rable with KM Props 61 1011 And since the sum of the squares on AC and CB is greater than twice the rectangle contained by AC and CB Prop 1059 lem DL is thus also greater than MF Hence DM is also greater than MG Props 61 514 And the rectan gle contained by DK and KM is equal to the square on MNthat is to say to one quarter the square on MG And DK is commensurable in length with KM And if there are two unequal straightlines and a rect angle equal to the fourth part of the square on the lesser falling short by a square gure is applied to the greater and divides it into parts which are commensu rable in length then the square on the greater is larger 351STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 than the square on the lesser by the square on some straightline commensurable in length with the greater Prop 1017 Thus the square on DM is greater than the square on MG by the square on some straight line commensurable in length with DM And DM and MG are rational And DM which is the greater term is commensurable in length with the previously laid down rational straightline DE Thus DG is a rst binomial straightline Def 105

a second binomial straightline For let the same construction have been made as in the proposition before this And since AB is a rst bimedial straightline having been divided at C AC and CB are thus medial straightlines commen surable in square only and containing a rational area Prop 1037 Hence the squares on AC and CB are also medial Prop 1021 Thus DL is medial Props 1015 1023 corr And it has

And they are rational DM and MG are thus rational and commensu 352STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 rable in square only DG is thus a binomial straightline Prop 1036 So we must show that it is also a second binomial straightline For since the sum of the squares on AC and CB is greater than twice the rectangle contained by AC and CB Prop 1059 DL is thus also greater than MF Hence DM is also greater than MG Prop 61 And since the square on AC is commensurable with the square on CB DH is also commensurable with KL Hence DK is also commensurable in length with KM Props 61 1011 And the rectangle contained by DKM is equal to the square on MN Thus the square on DM is greater than the square on MG by the square on some straightline commensurable in length with DM Prop 1017 And MG is commen

its component medial straightlines at C such that AC is the greater segment And let DE be some rational straightline And let the parallelogram DF equal to the square on AB have been applied to DE producing DG as breadth I say that DG is a third binomial straightline Let the same construction be made as that shown pre viously And since AB is a second bimedial straight line having been divided at C AC and CB are thus medial straightlines commensurable in square only and containing a medial area Prop 1038 Hence the sum of the squares on AC and CB is also medial Props 1015 1023 corr And it is equal to DL Thus DL is also medial And it is applied to the rational straightline DE MD is thus also rational and in 353STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 commensurable in length with DE Prop 1022 So for the same reasons MG is also rational and incom mensurable in length with MLthat is to say with DE Thus DM and MG are each rational and incommen surable in length with DE And since AC is incommen surable in length with CB and as AC is to CB so the square on AC is to the rectangle contained by ACB Prop 1021 lem the square on AC is also in commensurable with the rectangle contained by ACB Prop 1011 And hence the sum of the squares on AC and CB is incommensurable with twice the rect angle contained by ACBthat is to say DL with MF Props 1012 1013 Hence DM is also incommen surable in length with MG Props 61 1011 And they are rational DG is thus a binomial straightline Prop 1036 So we must show that it is also a third binomial straightline So similarly to the previous propositions we can conclude that DM is greater than MG and DK is com mensurable in length with KM And the rectangle contained by DKM is equal to the square on MN Thus the square on DM is greater than the square on MG by the square on some straightline commensu rable in length with DM Prop 1017 And neither of DM and MG is commensurable in length with DE Thus DG is a third binomial straightline Def 107 Which is the very thing it was required to show In other words the square of a second bimedial is a third binomial See Prop 1056 xg Proposition 63 The square on a major straightline applied to a ra tional

rational straightline And let the parallelogram DF equal to the square on AB have been applied to DE producing DG as breadth I say that DG is a fourth binomial straightline Let the same construction be made as that shown pre 354STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 viously And since AB is a major straightline hav ing been divided at C AC and CB are incommensu rable in square making the sum of the squares on them rational and the rectangle contained by them medial Prop 1039 Therefore since the sum of the squares on AC and CB is rational DL is thus rational Thus DM is also rational and commensurable in length with DE Prop 1020 Again since twice the rectangle con tained by AC and CBthat is to say MFis medial and is applied to the rational straightline ML MG is thus also rational and incommensurable in length with DE Prop 1022 DM is thus also incommensurable in length with MG Prop 1013 DM and MG are thus rational straightlines which are commensurable in square only Thus DG is a binomial straightline Prop 1036 So we must show that it is also a fourth binomial straightline So similarly to the previous propositions we can show that DM is greater than MG and that the rectan gle contained by DKM is equal to the square on MN Therefore since the square on AC is incommensurable with the square on CB DH is also incommensurable with KL Hence DK is also incommensurable with KM Props 61 1011 And if there are two unequal straightlines and a parallelogram equal to the fourth part of the square on the lesser falling short by a square gure is applied to the greater and divides it into parts which are incommensurable in length then the square on the greater will be larger than the square on the lesser by the square on some straightline incommen surable in length with the greater Prop 1018 Thus the square on DM is greater than the square on MG by the square on some straightline incommensurable in length with DM And DM and MG are rational straightlines which are commensurable in square only And DM is commensurable in length with the previ ously laid down rational straightline DE Thus DG is a fourth binomial straightline Def 108 Which is the very thing it was required to show In

at C AC and CB are thus incommensurable in square making the sum of the squares on them medial and the rectangle contained by them rational Prop 1040 Therefore since the sum of the squares on AC and CB is medial DL is thus medial Hence DM is rational and incommensurable in length with DE Prop 1022 Again since twice the rectangle contained by ACB that is to say MFis rational MG is thus rational and commensurable in length with DE Prop 1020 DM is thus incommensurable in length with MG Prop 1013 Thus DM and MG are rational straight lines which are commensurable in square only Thus DG is a binomial straightline Prop 1036 So I say that it is also a fth binomial straightline For similarly to the previous propositions it can be shown that the rectangle contained by DKM is equal to the square on MN and DK is incommen surable in length with KM Thus the square on DM is greater than the square on MG by the square on some straightline incommensurable in length with DM Prop 1018 And DM and MG are rational straightlines which are commensurable in square only and the lesser MG is commensurable in length with DE Thus DG is a fth binomial straightline Def 109 Which is the very thing it

incommensurable in square making the sum of the squares on them medial and the rectangle contained by them medial and moreover the sum of the squares on them incommensurable with the rectangle contained by them Prop 1041 Hence according to what has been previously demonstrated DL and MF are each medial And they are applied to the rational straightline DE Thus DM and MG are each rational and incommensurable in length with DE Prop 1022 And since the sum of the squares on AC and CB is incommensurable with twice the rectan gle contained by AC and CB DL is thus incommensu rable with MF Thus DM is also incommensurable in length with MG Props 61 1011 DM and MG are thus rational straightlines which are commensurable in square only Thus DG is a binomial straightline Prop 1036 So I say that it is also a sixth binomial straightline So similarly to the previous propositions we can again show that the rectangle contained by DKM is equal to the square on MN and that DK is incom mensurable in

Prop 511 Thus alternately as AE is to EB so CF is to FD Prop 516 And AE and EB are commensurable in square only Thus CF and FD are also commensurable in square only Prop 1011 And they are rational CD is thus a binomial straightline Prop 1036 So I say that it is the same in order as AB For the square on AE is greater than the square on EB by the square on some straightline either com mensurable or incommensurable in length with AE Therefore if the square on AE is greater than the square on EB by the square on some straightline com mensurable in length with AE then the square on CF will also be greater than the square on FD by the square on some straightline commensurable in length with CF Prop 1014 And if AE is com mensurable in length with some previously laid down rational straightline then CF will also be commensu rable in length with it Prop 1012 And on account of this AB and CD are each rst binomial straight lines Def 105that is to say the same in order And if EB is commensurable in length with the previously laid down rational straightline then FD is also com mensurable in length with it Prop 1012 and again on account of this CD will be the same in order as AB For each of them will be second binomial straight lines Def 106 And if neither of AE and EB is com mensurable in length with the previously laid down rational straightline then neither of CF and FD will be commensurable in length with it Prop 1013 and each of AB and CD is a third binomial straightline 358STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 Def 107 And if the square on AE is greater than the square on EB by the square on some straight line incommensurable in length with AE then the square on CF is also greater than the square on FD by the square on some straightline incommensurable in length with CF Prop 1014 And if AE is com mensurable in length with the previously laid down rational straightline then CF is also commensurable in length with it Prop 1012 and each of AB and CD is a fourth binomial straightline Def 108 And if EB is commensurable in length with the previously laid down rational straightline then FD is also com mensurable in length with it and each of AB and CD will be a fth binomial straightline Def 109 And if neither of AE and EB is commensurable in length with the previously laid down rational straightline then also neither of CF and FD is commensurable in length with the laid down rational straightline and each of AB and CD will be a sixth binomial straightline Def 1010 Hence a straightline commensurable in length with a binomial straightline is a binomial straight line and the same in order Which is the very thing it was required to show xz Proposition 67 A straightline commensurable in length with a bi medial straightline is itself also bimedial and the same in order F D A E B C Let AB be a bimedial straightline and let CD be commensurable in length with AB I say that CD is bi medial and the same in order as AB For since AB is a bimedial straightline let it have been divided into its component medial straightlines at E Thus AE and EB are medial straightlines which are commensurable in square only Props 1037 1038 And let it have been contrived that as AB is to CD so AE is to CF Prop 612 And thus as the remainder EB is to the remainder FD so AB is to CD Props 519 corr 616 And AB is commensurable in length with CD Thus AE and EB are also com mensurable in length with CF and FD respectively Prop 1011 And AE and EB are medial Thus CF and FD are also medial Prop 1023 And since as AE is to EB so CF is to FD and AE and EB are commensurable in square only CF and FD are thus 359STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 also commensurable in square only Prop 1011 And they were also shown to be medial Thus CD is a bi medial straightline So I say that it is also the same in order as AB For since as AE is to EB so CF is to FD thus also as the square on AE is to the rectangle con tained by AEB so the square on CF is to the rect angle contained by CFD Prop 1021 lem Alter nately as the square on AE is to the square on CF so the rectangle contained by AEB is to the rectangle contained by CFD Prop 516 And the square on AE is commensurable with the square on CF Thus the rectangle contained by AEB is also commensurable with the rectangle contained by CFD Prop 1011 Therefore either the rectangle contained by AEB is rational and the rectangle con tained by CFD is rational and on account of this AE and CD are rst bimedial straightlines or the rectangle contained by AEB is medial and the rect angle contained by CFD is medial and AB and CD are each second bimedial straightlines Props 1023 1037 1038 And on account of this CD will be the same in order as AB Which is the very thing it was required to show xh Proposition 68 A straightline commensurable in length with a major straightline is itself also major F D A E B C Let AB be a major straightline and let CD be com mensurable in length with AB I say that CD is a major straightline Let AB have been divided into its component terms at E AE and EB are thus incommensurable in square making the sum of the squares on them rational and the rectangle contained by them medial Prop 1039 And let the same things have been contrived as in the pre vious propositions And since as AB is to CD so AE is to CF and EB to FD thus also as AE is to CF so EB is to FD Prop 511 And AB is commen surable in length with CD Thus AE and EB are also commensurable in length with CF and FD re spectively Prop 1011 And since as AE is to CF so EB is to FD also alternately as AE is to EB so CF is to FD Prop 516 and thus via composition as AB is to BE so CD is to DF Prop 518 And thus as the square on AB is to the square on BE so the 360STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 square on CD is to the square on DF Prop 620 So similarly we can also show that as the square on AB is to the square on AE so the square on CD is to the square on CF And thus as the square on AB is to the sum of the squares on AE and EB so the square on CD is to the sum of the squares on CF and FD And thus alternately as the square on AB is to the square on CD so the sum of the squares on AE and EB is to the sum of the squares on CF and FD Prop 516 And the square on AB is commen surable with the square on CD Thus the sum of the squares on AE and EB is also commensurable with the sum of the squares on CF and FD Prop 1011 And the squares on AE and EB added together are rational The squares on CF and FD added together are thus also rational So similarly twice the rect angle contained by AE and EB is also commensurable with twice the rectangle contained by CF and FD And twice the rectangle contained by AE and EB is me dial Therefore twice the rectangle contained by CF and FD is also medial Prop 1023 corr CF and FD are thus straightlines which are incommensurable in square Prop 1013 simultaneously making the sum of the squares on them rational and twice the rectangle contained by them medial The whole CD is thus that irrational straightline called major Prop 1039 Thus a straightline commensurable in length with a major straightline is major Which is the very thing it was required to show xj Proposition 69 A straightline commensurable in length with the squareroot of a rational plus a medial area is itself also the squareroot of a rational plus a medial area F D A E B C Let AB be the squareroot of a rational plus a medial area and let CD be commensurable in length with AB We must show that CD is also the squareroot of a rational plus a medial area Let AB have been divided into its component straightlines at E AE and EB are thus incommensu rable in square making the sum of the squares on them medial and the rectangle contained by them rational Prop 1040 And let the same construction have been made as in the previous propositions So similarly we can show that CF and FD are also incommensurable in square and that the sum of the squares on AE and 361STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 EB is commensurable with the sum of the squares on CF and FD and the rectangle contained by AE and EB with the rectangle contained by CF and FD And hence the sum of the squares on CF and FD is me dial and the rectangle contained by CF and FD is rational Thus CD is the squareroot of a rational plus a medial area Prop 1040 Which is the very thing it was required to show o Proposition 70 A straightline commensurable in length with the squareroot of the sum of two medial areas is itself also the squareroot of the sum of two medial areas F D A E B C Let AB be the squareroot of the sum of two medial areas and let CD be commensurable in length with AB We must show that CD is also the squareroot of the sum of two medial areas For since AB is the squareroot of the sum of two medial areas let it have been divided into its compo nent straightlines at E Thus AE and EB are incom mensurable in square making the sum of the squares on them medial and the rectangle contained by them medial and moreover the sum of the squares on AE and EB incommensurable with the rectangle contained by AE and EB Prop 1041 And let the same construc tion have been made as in the previous propositions So similarly we can show that CF and FD are also incommensurable in square and that the sum of the squares on AE and EB is commensurable with the sum of the squares on CF and FD and the rectangle contained by AE and EB with the rectangle contained by CF and FD Hence the sum of the squares on CF and FD is also medial and the rectangle contained by CF and FD is medial and moreover the sum of the squares on CF and FD is incommensurable with the rectangle contained by CF and FD Thus CD is the squareroot of the sum of two me dial areas Prop 1041 Which is the very thing it was required to show oa Proposition 71 When a rational and a medial area are added to gether four irrational straightlines arise as the square roots of the total areaeither a binomial or a rst bi 362STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 medial or a major or the squareroot of a rational plus a medial area Let AB be a rational area and CD a medial area I say that the squareroot of area AD is either binomial or rst bimedial or major or the squareroot of a rational plus a medial area H B D I A E K C F G For AB is either greater or less than CD Let it rst of all be greater And let the rational straightline EF be laid down And let the rectangle EG equal to AB have been applied to EF producing EH as breadth And let the recatangle HI equal to DC have been ap plied to EF producing HK as breadth And since AB is rational and is equal to EG EG is thus also rational And it has been applied to the rational straightline EF producing EH as breadth EH is thus rational and commensurable in length with EF Prop 1020 Again since CD is medial and is equal to HI HI is thus also medial And it is applied to the rational straightline EF producing HK as breadth HK is thus rational and incommensurable in length with EF Prop 1022 And since CD is medial and AB rational AB is thus incommensurable with CD Hence EG is also incom mensurable with HI And as EG is to HI so EH is to HK Prop 61 Thus EH is also incommensurable in length with HK Prop 1011 And they are both ra tional Thus EH and HK are rational straightlines which are commensurable in square only EK is thus a binomial straightline having been divided into its component terms at H Prop 1036 And since AB is greater than CD and AB is equal to EG and CD to HI EG is thus also greater than HI Thus EH is also greater than HK Prop 514 Therefore the square on EH is greater than the square on HK either by the square on some straightline commensurable in length with EH or by the square on some straight line incommensurable in length with EH Let it rst of all be greater by the square on some straightline commensurable in length with EH And the greater 363STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 of the two components of EK HE is commensurable in length with the previously laid down straight line EF EK is thus a rst binomial straightline Def 105 And EF is rational And if an area is con tained by a rational straightline and a rst binomial straightline then the squareroot of the area is a bino mial straightline Prop 1054 Thus the squareroot of EI is a binomial straightline Hence the square root of AD is also a binomial straightline And so let the square on EH be greater than the square on HK by the square on some straightline incommensurable in length with EH And the greater of the two com ponents of EK EH is commensurable in length with the previously laid down rational straightline EF Thus EK is a fourth binomial straightline Def 108 And EF is rational And if an area is contained by a rational straightline and a fourth binomial straightline then the squareroot of the area is the irrational straightline called major Prop 1057 Thus the squareroot of area EI is a major straightline Hence the squareroot of AD is also major And so let AB be less than CD Thus EG is also less than HI Hence EH is also less than HK Props 61 514 And the square on HK is greater than the square on EH either by the square on some straight line commensurable in length with HK or by the square on some straightline incommensurable in length with HK Let it rst of all be greater by the square on some straightline commensurable in length with HK And the lesser of the two components of EK EH is commensurable in length with the previ ously laid down rational straightline EF Thus EK is a second binomial straightline Def 106 And EF is rational And if an area is contained by a rational straightline and a second binomial straightline then the squareroot of the area is a rst bimedial straight line Prop 1055 Thus the squareroot of area EI is a rst bimedial straightline Hence the squareroot of AD is also a rst bimedial straightline And so let the square on HK be greater than the square on HE by the square on some straightline incommensurable in length with HK And the lesser of the two compo nents of EK EH is commensurable in length with the previously laid down rational straightline EF Thus EK is a fth binomial straightline Def 109 And EF is rational And if an area is contained by a ratio nal straightline and a fth binomial straightline then the squareroot of the area is the squareroot of a rational plus a medial area Prop 1058 Thus the squareroot of area EI is the squareroot of a rational plus a medial area Hence the squareroot of area AD is also the 364STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 squareroot of a rational plus a medial area Thus when a rational and a medial area are added to gether four irrational straightlines arise as the square roots of the total areaeither a binomial or a rst bi medial or a major or the squareroot of a rational plus a medial area Which is the very thing it was required to show xb Proposition 72 When two medial areas which are incommensu rable with one another are added together the remaining two irrational straightlines arise as the squareroots of the total areaeither a second bimedial or the square root of the sum of two medial areas H B D I A E K C F G For let the two medial areas AB and CD which are incommensurable with one another have been added together I say that the squareroot of area AD is either a second bimedial or the squareroot of the sum of two medial areas For AB is either greater than or less than CD By chance let AB rst of all be greater than CD And let the rational straightline EF be laid down And let EG equal to AB have been applied to EF producing EH as breadth and HI equal to CD producing HK as breadth And since AB and CD are each medial EG and HI are thus also each medial And they are ap plied to the rational straightline FE producing EH and HK respectively as breadth Thus EH and HK are each rational straightlines which are incommensurable in length with EF Prop 1022 And since AB is incom mensurable with CD and AB is equal to EG and CD to HI EG is thus also incommensurable with HI And as EG is to HI so EH is to HK Prop 61 EH is thus incommensurable in length with HK Prop 1011 Thus EH and HK are rational straightlines which are commensurable in square only EK is thus a binomial straightline Prop 1036 And the square on EH is greater than the square on HK either by the square 365STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 on some straightline commensurable in length with EH or by the square on some straightline incom mensurable in length with EH Let it rst of all be greater by the square on some straightline commensu rable in length with EH And neither of EH or HK is commensurable in length with the previously laid down rational straightline EF Thus EK is a third binomial straightline Def 107 And EF is rational And if an area is contained by a rational straightline and a third binomial straightline then the squareroot of the area is a second bimedial straightline Prop 1056 Thus the squareroot of EIthat is to say of AD is a second bimedial And so let the square on EH be greater than the square on HK by the square on some straightline incommensurable in length with EH And EH and HK are each incommensurable in length with EF Thus EK is a sixth binomial straight line Def 1010 And if an area is contained by a ra tional straightline and a sixth binomial straightline then the squareroot of the area is the squareroot of the sum of two medial areas Prop 1059 Hence the squareroot of area AD is also the squareroot of the sum of two medial areas So similarly we can show that even if AB is less than CD the squareroot of area AD is either a second bimedial or the squareroot of the sum of two medial areas Thus when two medial areas which are incommen surable with one another are added together the remain ing two irrational straightlines arise as the square roots of the total areaeither a second bimedial or the squareroot of the sum of two medial areas A binomial straightline and the other irrational straightlines after it are neither the same as a medial straightline nor the same as one another For the square on a medial straightline applied to a rational straightline produces as breadth a rational straight line which is also incommensurable in length with the straightline to which it is applied Prop 1022 And the square on a binomial straightline applied to a rational straightline produces as breadth a rst bino mial Prop 1060 And the square on a rst bimedial straightline applied to a rational straightline pro duces as breadth a second binomial Prop 1061 And the square on a second bimedial straightline applied to a rational straightline produces as breadth a third binomial Prop 1062 And the square on a major straightline applied to a rational straightline pro duces as breadth a fourth binomial Prop 1063 And the square on the squareroot of a rational plus a medial 366STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 area applied to a rational straightline produces as breadth a fth binomial Prop 1064 And the square on the squareroot of the sum of two medial areas applied to a rational straightline produces as breadth a sixth binomial Prop 1065 And the aforementioned breadths differ from the rst breadth and from one anotherfrom the rst because it is rationaland from one another because they are not the same in order Hence the previously mentioned irrational straight lines themselves also differ from one another og Proposition 73 If a rational straightline which is commensu rable in square only with the whole is subtracted from another rational straightline then the remainder is an irrational straightline Let it be called an apotome B C A For let the rational straightline BC which com mensurable in square only with the whole have been subtracted from the rational straightline AB I say that the remainder AC is that irrational straightline called an apotome For since AB is incommensurable in length with BC and as AB is to BC so the square on AB is to the rectangle contained by AB and BC Prop 1021 lem the square on AB is thus incommensurable with the rectangle contained by AB and BC Prop 1011 But the sum of the squares on AB and BC is commen surable with the square on AB Prop 1015 and twice the rectangle contained by AB and BC is com mensurable with the rectangle contained by AB and BC Prop 106 And inasmuch as the sum of the squares on AB and BC is equal to twice the rectan gle contained by AB and BC plus the square on CA Prop 27 the sum of the squares on AB and BC is thus also incommensurable with the remaining square on AC Props 1013 1016 And the sum of the squares on AB and BC is rational AC is thus an ir rational straightline Def 104 And let it be called an apotome Which is the very thing it was required to show See footnote to Prop 1036 od Proposition 74 If a medial straightline which is commensurable in square only with the whole and which contains a ratio nal area with the whole is subtracted from another medial straightline then the remainder is an irrational 367STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 straightline Let it be called a rst apotome of a medial straightline B C A For let the medial straightline BC which is com mensurable in square only with AB and which makes with AB the rational rectangle contained by AB and BC have been subtracted from the medial straightline AB Prop 1027 I say that the remainder AC is an ir rational straightline Let it be called the rst apotome of a medial straightline For since AB and BC are medial straightlines the sum of the squares on AB and BC is also medial And twice the rectangle contained by AB and BC is ratio nal The sum of the squares on AB and BC is thus in commensurable with twice the rectangle contained by AB and BC Thus twice the rectangle contained by AB and BC is also incommensurable with the remain ing square on AC Prop 27 since if the whole is in commensurable with one of the constituent magnitudes then the original magnitudes will also be incommensu rable with one another Prop 1016 And twice the rectangle contained by AB and BC is rational Thus the square on AC is irrational Thus AC is an irra tional straightline Def 104 Let it be called a rst apotome of a medial straightline See footnote to Prop 1037 oe Proposition 75 If a medial straightline which is commensurable in square only with the whole and which contains a me dial area with the whole is subtracted from another medial straightline then the remainder is an irrational straightline Let it be called a second apotome of a medial straightline For let the medial straightline CB which is com mensurable in square only with the whole AB and which contains with the whole AB the medial rect angle contained by AB and BC have been subtracted from the medial straightline AB Prop 1028 I say that the remainder AC is an irrational straightline Let it be called a second apotome of a medial straightline 368STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 A B C H E F G D I For let the rational straightline DI be laid down And let DE equal to the sum of the squares on AB and BC have been applied to DI producing DG as breadth And let DH equal to twice the rectangle con tained by AB and BC have been applied to DI produc ing DF as breadth The remainder FE is thus equal to the square on AC Prop 27 And since the squares on AB and BC are medial and commensurable with one another DE is thus also medial Props 1015 1023 corr And it is applied to the rational straight line DI producing DG as breadth Thus DG is rational and incommensurable in length with DI Prop 1022 Again since the rectangle contained by AB and BC is medial twice the rectangle contained by AB and BC is thus also medial Prop 1023 corr And it is equal to DH Thus DH is also medial And it has been ap plied to the rational straightline DI producing DF as breadth DF is thus rational and incommensurable in length with DI Prop 1022 And since AB and BC are commensurable in square only AB is thus incommensu rable in length with BC Thus the square on AB is also incommensurable with the rectangle contained by AB and BC Props 1021 lem 1011 But the sum of the squares on AB and BC is commensurable with the square on AB Prop 1015 and twice the rectan gle contained by AB and BC is commensurable with the rectangle contained by AB and BC Prop 106 Thus twice the rectangle contained by AB and BC is incom mensurable with the sum of the squares on AB and BC Prop 1013 And DE is equal to the sum of the squares on AB and BC and DH to twice the rectangle contained by AB and BC Thus DE is incommensu rable with DH And as DE is to DH so GD is to DF Prop 61 Thus GD is incommensurable with DF Prop 1011 And they are both rational straightlines Thus GD and DF are rational straightlines which are commensurable in square only Thus FG is an apotome Prop 1073 And DI is rational And the area con tained by a rational and an irrational straightline is irrational Prop 1020 and its squareroot is irrational 369STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 And AC is the squareroot of FE Thus AC is an irra tional straightline Def 104 And let it be called the second apotome of a medial straightline Which is the very thing it was required to show See footnote to Prop 1038 o Proposition 76 If a straightline which is incommensurable in square with the whole and with the whole makes the squares on them added together rational and the rectangle contained by them medial is subtracted from another straightline then the remainder is an irrational straight line Let it be called a minor straightline B C A For let the straightline BC which is incommensu rable in square with the whole and fulls the other prescribed conditions have been subtracted from the straightline AB Prop 1033 I say that the remainder AC is that irrational straightline called minor For since the sum of the squares on AB and BC is rational and twice the rectangle contained by AB and BC is medial the sum of the squares on AB and BC is thus incommensurable with twice the rectangle con tained by AB and BC And via conversion the sum of the squares on AB and BC is incommensurable with the remaining square on AC Props 27 1016 And the sum of the squares on AB and BC is rational The square on AC is thus irrational Thus AC is an irrational straightline Def 104 Let it be called a minor straightline Which is the very thing it was required to show See footnote to Prop 1039 oz Proposition 77 If a straightline which is incommensurable in square with the whole and with the whole makes the sum of the squares on them medial and twice the rectangle con tained by them rational is subtracted from another straightline then the remainder is an irrational straight line Let it be called that which makes with a rational area a medial whole B C A For let the straightline BC which is incommensu rable in square with AB and fulls the other prescribed conditions have been subtracted from the straightline AB Prop 1034 I say that the remainder AC is the 370STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 aforementioned irrational straightline For since the sum of the squares on AB and BC is medial and twice the rectangle contained by AB and BC rational the sum of the squares on AB and BC is thus incommensurable with twice the rectangle con tained by AB and BC Thus the remaining square on AC is also incommensurable with twice the rectan gle contained by AB and BC Props 27 1016 And twice the rectangle contained by AB and BC is ratio nal Thus the square on AC is irrational Thus AC is an irrational straightline Def 104 And let it be called that which makes with a rational area a medial whole Which is the very thing it was required to show See footnote to Prop 1040 oh Proposition 78 If a straightline which is incommensurable in square with the whole and with the whole makes the sum of the squares on them medial and twice the rectangle con tained by them medial and moreover the sum of the squares on them incommensurable with twice the rect angle contained by them is subtracted from another straightline

AB and fulls the other prescribed conditions have been subtracted from the straight line AB Prop 1035 I say that the remainder AC is the irrational straightline called that which makes with a medial area a medial whole For let the rational straightline DI be laid down And let DE equal to the sum of the squares on AB and BC have been applied to DI producing DG as breadth And let DH equal to twice the rectangle contained by AB and BC have been subtracted from DE produc ing DF as breadth Thus the remainder FE is equal to the square on AC Prop 27 Hence AC is the squareroot of FE And since the sum of the squares on 371STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 AB and BC is medial and is equal to DE DE is thus medial And it is applied to the rational straightline DI producing DG as breadth Thus DG is rational and incommensurable in length with DI Prop 1022 Again since twice the rectangle contained by AB and BC is medial and is equal to DH DH is thus medial And it is applied to the rational straightline DI producing DF as breadth Thus DF is also rational and incommen surable in length with DI Prop 1022 And since the sum of the squares on AB and BC is incommensurable with twice the rectangle contained by AB and BC DE is also incommensurable with DH And as DE is to DH so DG also is to DF Prop 61 Thus DG is in commensurable in length with DF Prop 1011 And they are both rational Thus GD and DF are ratio nal straightlines which are commensurable in square only Thus FG is an apotome Prop 1073 And FH is rational And the rectangle contained by a rational straightline and an apotome is irrational Prop 1020 and its squareroot is irrational And AC is the square root of FE Thus AC is irrational Let it be called that which makes with a medial area a medial whole Which is the very thing it was required to show See footnote to Prop 1041 oj Proposition 79 Only one rational straightline which is commensu rable in square only with the whole can be attached to an apotome B A C D Let AB be an apotome with BC so attached to it AC and CB are thus rational straightlines which are commensurable in square only Prop 1073 I say that another rational straightline which is commensurable in square only with the whole cannot be attached to AB For if possible let BD be so attached to AB Thus AD and DB are also rational straightlines which are commensurable in square only Prop 1073 And since by whatever area the sum of the squares on AD and DB exceeds twice the rectangle contained by AD and DB the sum of the squares on AC and CB also ex ceeds twice the rectangle contained by AC and CB by this same area For both exceed by the same area namely the square on AB Prop 27 Thus alter nately by whatever area the sum of the squares on AD and DB exceeds the sum of the squares on AC and CB twice the rectangle contained by AD and DB also exceeds twice the rectangle contained by AC and 372STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 CB by this same area And the sum of the squares on AD and DB exceeds the sum of the squares on AC and CB by a rational area For both are rational ar eas Thus twice the rectangle contained by AD and DB also exceeds twice the rectangle contained by AC and CB by a rational area The very thing is impos sible For both are medial areas Prop 1021 and a medial area cannot exceed another medial area by a rational area Prop 1026 Thus another rational straightline which is commensurable in square only with the whole cannot be attached to AB Thus only one rational straightline which is com mensurable in square only with the whole can be at tached to an apotome Which is the very thing it was required to show This proposition is equivalent to Prop 1042 with minus signs instead of plus signs p Proposition 80 Only one medial straightline which is commensu rable in square only with the whole and contains a ra tional area with the whole can be attached to a rst apotome of a medial straightline B A C D For let AB be a rst apotome of a medial straight line and let BC be so attached to AB Thus AC and CB are medial straightlines which are commen surable in square only containing a rational area namely that contained by AC and CB Prop 1074 I say that another medial straightline which is com mensurable in square only with the whole and contains a rational area with the whole cannot be attached to AB For if possible let DB also be so attached to AB Thus AD and DB are medial straightlines which are commensurable in square only containing a ratio nal areanamely that contained by AD and DB Prop 1074 And since by whatever area the sum of the squares on AD and DB exceeds twice the rectangle contained by AD and DB the sum of the squares on AC and CB also exceeds twice the rectangle contained by AC and CB by this same area For again both ex ceed by the same areanamely the square on AB Prop 27 Thus alternately by whatever area the sum of the squares on AD and DB exceeds the sum of the squares on AC and CB twice the rectangle con tained by AD and DB also exceeds twice the rectangle contained by AC and CB by this same area And twice the rectangle contained by AD and DB exceeds twice 373STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 the rectangle contained by AC and CB by a rational area For both are rational areas Thus the sum of the squares on AD and DB also exceeds the sum of the squares on AC and CB by a rational area The very thing is impossible For both are medial areas Props 1015 1023 corr and a medial area can not exceed another medial area by a rational area Prop 1026 Thus only one medial straightline which is com mensurable in square only with the whole and contains a rational area with the whole can be attached to a rst apotome of a medial straightline Which is the very thing it was required to show This proposition is equivalent to Prop 1043 with minus

in square only containing a medial areanamely that contained by AC and CB Prop 1075 I say that another medial straightline which is commensurable in square only with the whole and contains a medial area with the whole cannot be attached to AB For if possible let BD be so attached Thus AD and DB are also medial straightlines which are com mensurable in square only containing a medial area namely that contained by AD and DB Prop 1075 And let the rational straightline EF be laid down And let EG equal to the sum of the squares on AC and CB have been applied to EF producing EM as breadth And let HG equal to twice the rectangle contained by AC and CB have been subtracted from EG produc ing HM as breadth The remainder EL is thus equal to the square on AB Prop 27 Hence AB is the 374STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 squareroot of EL So again let EI equal to the sum of the squares on AD and DB have been applied to EF producing EN as breadth And EL is also equal to the square on AB Thus the remainder HI is equal to twice the rectangle contained by AD and DB Prop 27 And since AC and CB are both medial straightlines the sum of the squares on AC and CB is also me dial And it is equal to EG Thus EG is also medial Props 1015 1023 corr And it is applied to the ratio nal straightline EF producing EM as breadth Thus EM is rational and incommensurable in length with EF Prop 1022 Again since the rectangle contained by AC and CB is medial twice the rectangle contained by AC and CB is also medial Prop 1023 corr And it is equal to HG Thus HG is also medial And it is ap plied to the rational straightline EF producing HM as breadth Thus HM is also rational and incommen surable in length with EF Prop 1022 And since AC and CB are commensurable in square only AC is thus incommensurable in length with CB And as AC is to CB so the square on AC is to the rectangle con tained by AC and CB Prop 1021 corr Thus the square on AC is incommensurable with the rectan gle contained by AC and CB Prop 1011 But the sum of the squares on AC and CB is commensurable with the square on AC and twice the rectangle con tained by AC and CB is commensurable with the rect angle contained by AC and CB Prop 106 Thus the sum of the squares on AC and CB is incommen surable with twice the rectangle contained by AC and CB Prop 1013 And EG is equal to the sum of the squares on AC and CB And GH is equal to twice the rectangle contained by AC and CB Thus EG is in commensurable with HG And as EG is to HG so EM is to HM Prop 61 Thus EM is incommensurable in length with MH Prop 1011 And they are both rational straightlines Thus EM and MH are ratio nal straightlines which are commensurable in square only Thus EH is an apotome Prop 1073 and HM is attached to it So similarly we can show that HN is also commensurable in square only with EN and is attached to EH Thus different straightlines which are commensurable in square only with the whole are attached to an apotome The very thing is impossible Prop 1079 Thus only one medial straightline which is commen surable in square only with the whole and contains a me dial area with the whole can be attached to a second apotome of a medial straightline Which is the very thing it was required to show 375STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 This proposition is equivalent to Prop 1044 with minus signs instead of plus signs pb Proposition 82 Only one straightline which is incommensurable in square with the whole and together with the whole makes the sum of the squares on them rational and twice the rectangle contained by them medial can be attached to a minor straightline B A C D Let AB be a minor straightline and let BC be so attached to AB Thus AC and CB are straightlines which are incommensurable in square making the sum of the squares on them rational and twice the rectan gle contained by them medial Prop 1076 I say that another another straightline fullling the same condi tions cannot be attached to AB For if possible let BD be so attached to AB Thus AD and DB are also straightlines which are incommensurable in square fullling the other afore mentioned conditions Prop 1076 And since by whatever area the sum of the squares on AD and DB exceeds the sum of the squares on AC and CB twice the rectangle contained by AD and DB also exceeds twice the rectangle contained by AC and CB by this same area Prop 27 And the sum of the squares on AD and DB exceeds the sum of the squares on AC and CB by a rational area For both are rational ar eas Thus twice the rectangle contained by AD and DB also exceeds twice the rectangle contained by AC and CB by a rational area The very thing is impossible For both are medial areas Prop 1026 Thus only one straightline which is incommensu rable in square with the whole and with the whole makes the squares on them added together rational and twice the rectangle contained by them medial can be attached to a minor straightline Which is the very thing it was required to show This proposition is equivalent to Prop 1045 with minus signs instead of plus signs pg Proposition 83 Only one straightline which is incommensurable in square with the whole and together with the whole makes the sum of the squares on them medial and twice the rectangle contained by them rational can be at tached to that straightline which with a rational area makes a medial whole B A C D 376STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 Let AB be a straightline which with a rational area makes a medial whole and let BC be so at tached to AB Thus AC and CB are straightlines which are incommensurable in square fullling the other proscribed conditions Prop 1077 I say that another straightline fullling the same conditions cannot be attached to AB For if possible let BD be so attached to AB Thus AD and DB are also straightlines which are incommensurable in square fullling the other pre scribed conditions Prop 1077 Therefore analo gously to the propositions before this since by what ever area the sum of the squares on AD and DB ex ceeds the sum of the squares on AC and CB twice the rectangle contained by AD and DB also exceeds twice the rectangle contained by AC and CB by this same area And twice the rectangle contained by AD and DB exceeds twice the rectangle contained by AC and CB by a rational area For they are both rational ar eas Thus the sum of the squares on AD and DB also exceeds the sum of the squares on AC and CB by a ra tional area The very thing is impossible For both are medial areas Prop 1026 Thus another straightline cannot be attached to AB which is incommensurable in square with the whole and fullls the other aforementioned conditions with the whole Thus only one such straightline can be so attached Which is the very thing it was required to show This proposition is equivalent to Prop 1046 with minus signs instead of plus signs pd Proposition 84 Only one straightline which is incommensurable in square with the whole and together with the whole makes the sum of the squares on them medial and twice the rectangle contained by them medial and more over incommensurable with the sum of the squares on them can be attached to that straightline which with a medial area makes a medial whole Let AB be a straightline which with a medial area makes a medial whole BC being so attached to it Thus AC and CB are incommensurable in square fullling the other aforementioned conditions Prop 1078 I say that another straightline fulll ing the aforementioned conditions cannot be attached to AB 377STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 C A B D E M N I L F H G For if possible let BD be so attached Hence AD and DB are also straightlines which are incom mensurable in square making the squares on AD and DB added together medial and twice the rectangle contained by AD and DB medial and moreover the sum of the squares on AD and DB incommensurable with twice the rectangle contained by AD and DB Prop 1078 And let the rational straightline EF be laid down And let EG equal to the sum of the squares on AC and CB have been applied to EF producing EM as breadth And let HG equal to twice the rectangle contained by AC and CB have been applied to EF producing HM as breadth Thus the remaining square on AB is equal to EL Prop 27 Thus AB is the square root of EL Again let EI equal to the sum of the squares on AD and DB have been applied to EF pro ducing EN as breadth And the square on AB is also equal to EL Thus the remaining twice the rectangle contained by AD and DB is equal to HI Prop 27 And since the sum of the squares on AC and CB is me dial and is equal to EG EG is thus also medial And it is applied to the rational straightline EF producing EM as breadth EM is thus rational and incommen surable in length with EF Prop 1022 Again since twice the rectangle contained by AC and CB is me dial and is equal to HG HG is thus also medial And it is applied to the rational straightline EF produc ing HM as breadth HM is thus rational and incom mensurable in length with EF Prop 1022 And since the sum of the squares on AC and CB is incommen surable with twice the rectangle contained by AC and CB EG is also incommensurable with HG Thus EM is also incommensurable in length with MH Props 61 1011 And they are both rational straightlines Thus EM and MH are rational straightlines which are com mensurable in square only Thus EH is an apotome Prop 1073 with HM attached to it So similarly we can show that EH is again an apotome with HN attached to it Thus different rational straightlines which are commensurable in square only with the whole are attached to an apotome The very thing was shown 378STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 to be impossible Prop 1079 Thus another straight line cannot be so attached to AB Thus only one straightline which is incommensu rable in square with the whole and together with the whole makes the squares on them added together me dial and twice the rectangle contained by them medial and moreover the sum of the squares on them incom mensurable with the rectangle contained by them can be attached to AB Which is the very thing it was re quired to show This proposition is equivalent to Prop 1047 with minus

commensurable in length with EG thus DG is also commensurable in length with each of DE and EG Prop 1015 But DG is commensurable in length with AC thus DE and EG are also each rational and com mensurable in length with AC Thus DH and EK are each rational areas Prop 1019 Therefore let the square LM equal to AI have been constructed And let NO equal to FK which is about the same angle LPM as LM have been subtracted from LM Thus the squares LM and NO are about the same diagonal Prop 626 Let PR be their com mon diagonal and let the rest of the gure have been drawn Therefore since AI and FK are medial areas and are equal to the squares on LP and PN respec tively thus the squares on LP and PN are also me dial Thus LP and PN are also medial straightlines which are commensurable in square only And since the rectangle contained by AF and FG is equal to the square on EG thus as AF is to EG so EG is to FG Prop 1017 But as AF is to EG so AI is to EK And as EG is to FG so EK is to FK Prop 61 Thus EK is the mean proportional to AI 389STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 and FK Prop 511 And MN is also the mean pro portional to the squares LM and NO Prop 1053 lem And AI is equal to LM and FK to NO Thus MN is also equal to EK But DH is equal to EK and LO equal to MN Prop 143 Thus the whole of DK is equal to the gnomon UV W and NO Therefore since the whole of AK is equal to LM and NO of which DK is equal to the gnomon UV W and NO the remainder AB is thus equal to T S And T S is the square on LN Thus the square on LN is equal to the area AB LN is thus the squareroot of area AB So I say that LN is the rst apotome of a medial straightline For since EK is a rational area and is equal to LO LOthat is to say the rectangle contained by LP and PNis thus a rational area And NO was shown to be a medial area Thus LO is incommensurable with NO And as LO is to NO so LP is to PN Prop 61 Thus LP and PN are incommensurable in length Prop 1011 LP and PN are thus medial straightlines which are commensurable in square only and which contain a rational area Thus LN is the rst apotome of a medial straightline Prop 1074 And it is the squareroot of area AB Thus the square root of area AB is the rst apotome of a medial straightline Which is the very thing it was required to show There is an error in the argument here It should just say that LP and P N are commensurable in square rather than in square only since LP and P N are only shown to be incommensurable in length later on g Proposition 93 If an area is contained by a rational straightline and a third apotome then the squareroot of the area is a sec ond apotome of a medial straightline C A D B K O N E I S L R M T F G H V P Q U W For let the area AB have been contained by the ratio nal straightline AC and the third apotome AD I say that the squareroot of area AB is the second apotome of a medial straightline For let DG be an attachment to AD Thus AG and GD are rational straightlines which are commensu rable in square only Prop 1073 and neither of AG and GD is commensurable in length with the previ 390STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 ously laid down rational straightline AC and the square on the whole AG is greater than the square on the attachment DG by the square on some straight line commensurable in length with AG Def 1013 Therefore since the square on AG is greater than the square on GD by the square on some straightline commensurable in length with AG thus if an area equal to the fourth part of the square on DG is applied to AG falling short by a square gure then it divides AG into parts which are commensurable in length Prop 1017 Therefore let DG have been cut in half at E And let an area equal to the square on EG have been applied to AG falling short by a square g ure And let it be the rectangle contained by AF and FG And let EH FI and GK have been drawn through points E F and G respectively parallel to AC Thus AF and FG are commensurable in length AI is thus also commensurable with FK Props 61 1011 And since AF and FG are commensurable in length AG is thus also commensurable in length with each of AF and FG Prop 1015 And AG is rational and incommen surable in length with AC Hence AF and FG are also rational and incommensurable in length with AC Prop 1013 Thus AI and FK are each medial ar eas Prop 1021 Again since DE is commensurable in length with EG DG is also commensurable in length with each of DE and EG Prop 1015 And GD is rational and incommensurable in length with AC Thus DE and EG are each also rational and incommensu rable in length with AC Prop 1013 DH and EK are thus each medial areas Prop 1021 And since AG and GD are commensurable in square only AG is thus incommensurable in length with GD But AG is com mensurable in length with AF and DG with EG Thus AF is incommensurable in length with EG Prop 1013 And as AF is to EG so AI is to EK Prop 61 Thus AI is incommensurable with EK Prop 1011 Therefore let the square LM equal to AI have been constructed And let NO equal to FK which is about the same angle as LM have been subtracted from LM Thus LM and NO are about the same diagonal Prop 626 Let PR be their common diagonal and let the rest of the gure have been drawn Therefore since the rectangle contained by AF and FG is equal to the square on EG thus as AF is to EG so EG is to FG Prop 617 But as AF is to EG so AI is to EK Prop 61 And as EG is to FG so EK is to FK Prop 61 And thus as AI is to EK so EK is to FK Prop 511 Thus EK is the mean proportional to AI and FK And MN is also the mean proportional to the squares LM and NO Prop 1053 lem And AI is 391STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 equal to LM and FK to NO Thus EK is also equal to MN But MN is equal to LO and EK is equal to DH Prop 143 And thus the whole of DK is equal to the gnomon UV W and NO And AK is also equal to LM and NO Thus the remainder AB is equal to ST that is to say to the square on LN Thus LN is the squareroot of area AB I say that LN is the second apotome of a medial straightline For since AI and FK were shown to be medial ar eas and are equal to the squares on LP and PN re spectively the squares on each of LP and PN are thus also medial Thus LP and PN are each medial straightlines And since AI is commensurable with FK Props 61 1011 the square on LP is thus also commensurable with the square on PN Again since AI was shown to be incommensurable with EK LM is thus also incommensurable with MNthat is to say the square on LP with the rectangle contained by LP and PN Hence LP is also incommensurable in length with PN Props 61 1011 Thus LP and PN are medial straightlines which are commensurable in square only So I say that they also contain a medial area For since EK was shown to be a medial area and is equal to the rectangle contained by LP and PN the rectangle contained by LP and PN is thus also medial Hence LP and PN are medial straightlines which are commensurable in square only and which contain a me dial area Thus LN is the second apotome of a medial straightline Prop 1075 And it is the squareroot of area AB Thus the squareroot of area AB is the second apo tome of a medial straightline Which is the very thing it was required to show d Proposition 94 If an area is contained by a rational straightline and a fourth apotome then the squareroot of the area is a minor straightline C A D B K O N E I S L R M T F G H V P Q U W For let the area AB have been contained by the ra tional straightline AC and the fourth apotome AD I say that the squareroot of area AB is a minor straight 392STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 line For let DG be an attachment to AD Thus AG and DG are rational straightlines which are commen surable in square only Prop 1073 and AG is com mensurable in length with the previously laid down ra tional straightline AC and the square on the whole AG is greater than the square on the attachment DG by the square on some straightline incommensurable in length with AG Def 1014 Therefore since the square on AG is greater than the square on GD by the square on some straightline incommensurable in length with AG thus if some area equal to the fourth part of the square on DG is applied to AG falling short by a square gure then it divides AG into parts which are incommensurable in length Prop 1018 There fore let DG have been cut in half at E and let some area equal to the square on EG have been applied to AG falling short by a square gure and let it be the rectangle contained by AF and FG Thus AF is in commensurable in length with FG Therefore let EH FI and GK have been drawn through E F and G re spectively parallel to AC and BD Therefore since AG is rational and commensurable in length with AC the whole area AK is thus rational Prop 1019 Again since DG is incommensurable in length with AC and both are rational straightlines DK is thus a medial area Prop 1021 Again since AF is incommensu rable in length with FG AI is thus also incommensu rable with FK Props 61 1011 Therefore let the square LM equal to AI have been constructed And let NO equal to FK and about the same angle LPM have been subtracted from LM Thus the squares LM and NO are about the same diag onal Prop 626 Let PR be their common diagonal and let the rest of the gure have been drawn There fore since the rectangle contained by AF and FG is equal to the square on EG thus proportionally as AF is to EG so EG is to FG Prop 617 But as AF is to EG so AI is to EK and as EG is to FG so EK is to FK Prop 61 Thus EK is the mean proportional to AI and FK Prop 511 And MN is also the mean pro portional to the squares LM and NO Prop 1013 lem and AI is equal to LM and FK to NO EK is thus also equal to MN But DH is equal to EK and LO is equal to MN Prop 143 Thus the whole of DK is equal to the gnomon UV W and NO Therefore since the whole of AK is equal to the sum of the squares LM and NO of which DK is equal to the gnomon UV W and the square NO the remainder AB is thus equal to ST that is to say to the square on LN Thus LN is the squareroot of area AB I say that LN is the irrational straightline which is called minor 393STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 For since AK is rational and is equal to the sum of the squares LP and PN the sum of the squares on LP and PN is thus rational Again since DK is me dial and DK is equal to twice the rectangle contained by LP and PN thus twice the rectangle contained by LP and PN is medial And since AI was shown to be incommensurable with FK the square on LP is thus also incommensurable with the square on PN Thus LP and PN are straightlines which are incommensurable in square making the sum of the squares on them ra tional and twice the rectangle contained by them me dial LN is thus the irrational straightline called minor Prop 1076 And it is the squareroot of area AB Thus the squareroot of area AB is a minor straight line Which is the very thing it was required to show e Proposition 95 If an area is contained by a rational straightline and a fth apotome then the squareroot of the area is that straightline which with a rational area makes a me dial whole C A D B K O N E I S L R M T F G H V P Q U W For let the area AB have been contained by the ra tional straightline AC and the fth apotome AD I say that the squareroot of area AB is that straightline which with a rational area makes a medial whole For let DG be an attachment to AD Thus AG and DG are rational straightlines which are commensu rable in square only Prop 1073 and the attachment GD is commensurable in length the the previously laid down rational straightline AC and the square on the whole AG is greater than the square on the attach ment DG by the square on some straightline incom mensurable in length with AG Def 1015 Thus if some area equal to the fourth part of the square on DG is applied to AG falling short by a square gure then it divides AG into parts which are incommensu rable in length Prop 1018 Therefore let DG have been divided in half at point E and let some area equal to the square on EG have been applied to AG falling short by a square gure and let it be the rectangle con tained by AF and FG Thus AF is incommensurable in length with FG And since AG is incommensurable 394STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 in length with CA and both are rational straightlines AK is thus a medial area Prop 1021 Again since DG is rational and commensurable in length with AC DK is a rational area Prop 1019 Therefore let the square LM equal to AI have been constructed And let the square NO equal to FK and about the same angle LPM have been subtracted from NO Thus the squares LM and NO are about the same diagonal Prop 626 Let PR be their common diag onal and let the rest of the gure have been drawn So similarly to the previous propositions we can show that LN is the squareroot of area AB I say that LN is that straightline which with a rational area makes a medial whole For since AK was shown to be a medial area and is equal to the sum of the squares on LP and PN the sum of the squares on LP and PN is thus medial Again since DK is rational and is equal to twice the rectangle contained by LP and PN the latter is also rational And since AI is incommensurable with FK the square on LP is thus also incommensurable with the square on PN Thus LP and PN are straightlines which are incommensurable in square making the sum of the squares on them medial and twice the rectangle contained by them rational Thus the remainder LN is the irrational straightline called that which with a ra tional area makes a medial whole Prop 1077 And it is the squareroot of area AB Thus the squareroot of area AB is that straight line which with a rational area makes a medial whole Which is the very thing it was required to show Proposition 96 If an area is contained by a rational straightline and a sixth apotome then the squareroot of the area is that straightline which with a medial area makes a medial whole C A D B K O N E I S L R M T F G H V P Q U W For let the area AB have been contained by the ra tional straightline AC and the sixth apotome AD I say that the squareroot of area AB is that straightline which with a medial area makes a medial whole For let DG be an attachment to AD Thus AG and 395STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 GD are rational straightlines which are commensu rable in square only Prop 1073 and neither of them is commensurable in length with the previously laid down rational straightline AC and the square on the whole AG is greater than the square on the attachment DG by the square on some straightline incommensurable in length with AG Def 1016 Therefore since the square on AG is greater than the square on GD by the square on some straightline incommensurable in length with AG thus if some area equal to the fourth part of square on DG is applied to AG falling short by a square gure then it divides AG into parts which are incommensurable in length Prop 1018 There fore let DG have been cut in half at point E And let some area equal to the square on EG have been ap plied to AG falling short by a square gure And let it be the rectangle contained by AF and FG AF is thus incommensurable in length with FG And as AF is to FG so AI is to FK Prop 61 Thus AI is incommen surable with FK Prop 1011 And since AG and AC are rational straightlines which are commensurable in square only AK is a medial area Prop 1021 Again since AC and DG are rational straightlines which are incommensurable in length DK is also a medial area Prop 1021 Therefore since AG and GD are com mensurable in square only AG is thus incommensurable in length with GD And as AG is to GD so AK is to KD Prop 61 Thus AK is incommensurable with KD Prop 1011 Therefore let the square LM equal to AI have been constructed And let NO equal to FK and about the same

rectangle contained by LP and PN is also medial And since AK was shown to be incommensu rable with DK thus the sum of the squares on LP and PN is also incommensurable with twice the rect angle contained by LP and PN And since AI is in commensurable with FK the square on LP is thus also incommensurable with the square on PN Thus LP and PN are straightlines which are incommensu 396STOIQEIWN i

on MF has been applied to CM falling short by a square gure and divides it into incommensurable parts the square on CM is thus greater than the square on MF by the square on some straightline incommensurable 403STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 in length with CM Prop 1018 And the whole of CM is commensurable in length with the previously laid down rational straightline CD Thus CF is a fourth apotome Def 1014 Thus the square on a minor and so on ra Proposition 101 The square on that straightline which with a ra tional area makes a medial whole applied to a rational straightline produces a fth apotome as breadth N D E L G Z M A B H K J X N D E L M A B C F G K H O Let AB be that straightline which with a ratio nal area makes a medial whole and CD a rational straightline And let CE equal to the square on AB have been applied to CD producing CF as breadth I say that CF is a fth apotome Let BG be an attachment to AB Thus the straight lines AG and GB are incommensurable in square mak ing the sum of the squares on them medial and twice the rectangle contained by them rational Prop 1077 And let CH equal to the square on AG have been ap plied to CD and KL equal to the square on GB The whole of CL is thus equal to the sum of the squares on AG and GB And the sum of the squares on AG and GB together is medial Thus CL is medial And it has been applied to the rational straightline CD produc ing CM as breadth CM is thus rational and incommen surable in length with CD Prop 1022 And since the whole of CL is equal to the sum of the squares on AG and GB of which CE is equal to the square on AB the remainder FL is thus equal to twice the rect angle contained by AG and GB Prop 27 Therefore let FM have been cut in half at N And let NO have been drawn through N parallel to either of CD or ML Thus FO and NL are each equal to the rectangle con tained by AG and GB And since twice the rectangle contained by AG and GB is rational and is equal to FL FL is thus rational And it is applied to the ratio nal straightline EF producing FM as breadth Thus FM is rational and commensurable in length with CD Prop 1020 And since CL is medial and FL rational 404STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 CL is thus incommensurable with FL And as CL is to FL so CM is to MF Prop 61 CM is thus incom mensurable in length with MF Prop 1011 And both are rational Thus CM and MF are rational straight lines which are commensurable in square only CF is thus an apotome Prop 1073 So I say that it is also a fth apotome For similarly to the previous propositions we can show that the rectangle contained by CKM is equal to the square on NMthat is to say to the fourth part of the square on FM And since the square on AG is incommensurable with the square on GB and the square on AG is equal to CH and the square on GB to KL CH is thus incommensurable with KL And as CH is to KL so CK is to KM Prop 61 Thus CK is incommensurable in length with KM Prop 1011 Therefore since CM and MF are two un equal straightlines and some area equal to the fourth part of the square on FM has been applied to CM falling short by a square gure and divides it into incom mensurable parts the square on CM is thus greater than the square on MF by the square on some straightline incommensurable in length with CM Prop 1018 And the attachment FM is commensu rable with the previously laid down rational straight line CD Thus CF is a fth apotome Def 1015 Which is the very thing it was required to show rb Proposition 102 The square on that straightline which with a me dial area makes a medial whole applied to a rational straightline produces a sixth apotome as breadth N D E L G Z M A B H K J X N D E L M A B C F G K H O Let AB be that straightline which with a me dial area makes a medial whole and CD a rational straightline And let CE equal to the square on AB have been applied to CD producing CF as breadth I say that CF is a sixth apotome For let BG be an attachment to AB Thus AG and GB are incommensurable in square making the sum of the squares on them medial and twice the rectangle 405STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 contained by AG and GB medial and the sum of the squares on AG and GB incommensurable with twice the rectangle contained by AG and GB Prop 1078 Therefore let CH equal to the square on AG have been applied to CD producing CK as breadth and KL equal to the square on BG Thus the whole of CL is equal to the sum of the squares on AG and GB CL is thus also medial And it is applied to the ratio nal straightline CD producing CM as breadth Thus CM is rational and incommensurable in length with CD Prop 1022 Therefore since CL is equal to the sum of the squares on AG and GB of which CE is equal to the square on AB the remainder FL is thus equal to twice the rectangle contained by AG and GB Prop 27 And twice the rectangle contained by AG and GB is medial Thus FL is also medial And it is applied to the rational straightline FE producing FM as breadth FM is thus rational and incommensurable in length with CD Prop 1022 And since the sum of the squares on AG and GB is incommensurable with twice the rectangle contained by AG and GB and CL equal to the sum of the squares on AG and GB and FL equal to twice the rectangle contained by AG and GB CL is thus incommensurable with FL And as CL is to FL so CM is to MF Prop 61 Thus CM is incommensurable in length with MF Prop 1011 And they are both rational Thus CM and MF are rational straightlines which are commensurable in square only CF is thus an apotome Prop 1073 So I say that it is also a sixth apotome For since FL is equal to twice the rectangle con tained by AG and GB let FM have been cut in half at N and let NO have been drawn through N parallel to CD Thus FO and NL are each equal to the rect angle contained by AG and GB And since AG and GB are incommensurable in square the square on AG is thus incommensurable with the square on GB But CH is equal to the square on AG and KL is equal to the square on GB Thus CH is incommensurable with KL And as CH is to KL so CK is to KM Prop 61 Thus CK is incommensurable in length with KM Prop 1011 And since the rectangle con tained by AG and GB is the mean proportional to the squares on AG and GB Prop 1021 lem and CH is equal to the square on AG and KL equal to the square on GB and NL equal to the rectangle con tained by AG and GB NL is thus also the mean pro portional to CH and KL Thus as CH is to NL so NL is to KL And for the same reasons as the preced ing propositions the square on CM is greater than the square on MF by the square on some straightline 406STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 incommensurable in length with CM Prop 1018 And neither of them is commensurable with the previ ously laid down rational straightline CD Thus CF is a sixth apotome Def 1016 Which is the very thing it was required to show rg Proposition 103 A straightline commensurable in length with an apotome is an apotome and is the same in order F A D B E C Let AB be an apotome and let CD be commensu rable in length with AB I say that CD is also an apo tome and is the same in order as AB For since AB is an apotome let BE be an attachment to it Thus AE and EB are rational straightlines which are commensurable in square only Prop 1073 And let it have been contrived that the ratio of BE to DF is the same as the ratio of AB to CD Prop 612 Thus also as one is to one so all are to all Prop 512 And thus as the whole AE is to the whole CF so AB is to CD And AB is commensurable in length with CD AE is thus also commensurable in length with CF and BE with DF Prop 1011 And AE and BE are rational straightlines which are commensu rable in square only Thus CF and FD are also rational straightlines which are commensurable in square only Prop 1013 CD is thus an apotome So I say that it is also the same in order as AB Therefore since as AE is to CF so BE is to DF thus alternately as AE is to EB so CF is to FD Prop 516 So the square on AE is greater than the square on EB either by the square on some straightline commensurable or by the square on some straightline incommensurable in length with AE Therefore if the square on AE is greater than the square on EB by the square on some straightline commensurable in length with AE then the square on CF will also be greater than the square on FD by the square on some straightline commen surable in length with CF Prop 1014 And if AE is commensurable in length with a previously laid down rational straightline then so is CF Prop 1012 and if BE is commensurable so is DF and if nei ther of AE or EB are commensurable neither are either of CF or FD Prop 1013 And if the square on AE is greater than the square on EB by the square on some straightline incommensurable in 407STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 length with AE then the square on CF will also be greater than the square on FD by the square on some straightline incommensurable in length with CF Prop 1014 And if AE is commensurable in length with a previously laid down rational straight line so is CF Prop 1012 and if BE is com mensurable so is DF and if neither of AE or EB are commensurable neither are either of CF or FD Prop 1013 Thus CD is an apotome and is the same in order as AB Defs 10111016 Which is the very thing it was required to show rd Proposition 104 A straightline commensurable in length with an apotome of a medial straightline is an apotome of a medial straightline and is the same in order F A D B E C Let AB be an apotome of a medial straightline and let CD be commensurable in length with AB I say that CD is also an apotome of a medial straightline and is the same in order as AB For since AB is an apotome of a medial straight line let EB be an attachment to it Thus AE and EB are medial straightlines which are commensurable in square only Props 1074 1075 And let it have been contrived that as AB is to CD so BE is to DF Prop 612 Thus AE is also commensurable in length with CF and BE with DF Props 512 1011 And AE and EB are medial straightlines which are commensurable in square only CF and FD are thus also medial straightlines which are commensurable in square only Props 1023 1013 Thus CD is an apo tome of a medial straightline Props 1074 1075 So I say that it is also the same in order as AB For since as AE is to EB so CF is to FD Props 512 516 but as AE is to EB so the square on AE is to the rectangle contained by AE and EB and as CF is to FD so the square on CF is to the rectangle contained by CF and FD thus as the square on AE is to the rectangle contained by AE and EB so the square on CF also is to the rectan gle contained by CF and FD Prop 1021 lem and alternately as the square on AE is to the square on CF so the rectangle contained by AE and EB is to the rectangle contained by CF and FD And the square on AE is commensurable with the square 408STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 on CF Thus the rectangle contained by AE and EB is also commensurable with the rectangle contained by CF and FD Props 516 1011 Therefore either the rectangle contained by AE and EB is rational and the rectangle contained by CF and FD will also be ratio nal Def 104 or the rectangle contained by AE and EB is medial and the rectangle contained by CF and FD is also medial Prop 1023 corr Therefore CD is the apotome of a medial straight line and is the same in order as AB Props 1074 1075 Which is the very thing it was required to show re Proposition 105 A straightline commensurable in length with a minor straightline is a minor straightline F A D B E C For let AB be a minor straightline and let CD be commensurable in length with AB I say that CD is also a minor straightline For let the same things have been contrived as in the former proposition And since AE and EB are straightlines which are incommensurable in square Prop 1076 CF and FD are thus also straightlines which are incommensurable in square Prop 1013 Therefore since as AE is to EB so CF is to FD Props 512 516 thus also as the square on AE is to the square on EB so the square on CF is to the square on FD Prop 622 Thus via composition as the sum of the squares on AE and EB is to the square on EB so the sum of the squares on CF and FD is to the square on FD Prop 518 also alternately And the square on BE is commensurable with the square on DF Prop 10104 The sum of the squares on AE and EB is thus also commensurable with the sum of the squares on CF and FD Prop 516 1011 And the sum of the squares on AE and EB is rational Prop 1076 Thus the sum of the squares on CF and FD is also rational Def 104 Again since as the square on AE is to the rectangle contained by AE and EB so the square on CF is to the rectangle contained by CF and FD Prop 1021 lem and the square on AE is commensurable with the square on CF the rect angle contained by AE and EB is thus also commen surable with the rectangle contained by CF and FD And the rectangle contained by AE and EB is me dial Prop 1076 Thus the rectangle contained by CF and FD is also medial Prop 1023 corr CF and 409STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 FD are thus straightlines which are incommensurable in square making the sum of the squares on them ratio nal and the rectangle contained by them medial Thus CD is a minor straightline Prop 1076 Which is the very thing it was required to show r Proposition 106 A straightline commensurable in length with a straightline which with a rational area makes a me dial whole is a straightline which with a rational area makes a medial whole F A D B E C Let AB be a straightline which with a rational area makes a medial whole and let CD be com mensurable in length with AB I say that CD is also a straightline which with a rational area makes a me dial whole For let BE be an attachment to AB Thus AE and EB are straightlines which are incommensurable in square making the sum of the squares on AE and EB medial and the rectangle contained by them rational Prop 1077 And let the same construction have been made as in the previous propositions So similarly to the previous propositions we can show that CF and FD are in the same ratio as AE and EB and the sum of the squares on AE and EB is commensurable with the sum of the squares on CF and FD and the rectangle contained by AE and EB with the rectangle contained by CF and FD Hence CF and FD are also straight lines which are incommensurable in square making the sum of the squares on CF and FD medial and the rect angle contained by them rational CD is thus a straightline which with a rational area makes a medial whole Prop 1077 Which is the very thing it was required to show rz Proposition 107 A straightline commensurable in length with a straightline which with a medial area makes a me dial whole is itself also a straightline which with a me dial area makes a medial whole F A D B E C Let AB be a straightline which with a medial area 410STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 makes a medial whole and let CD be commensurable in length with AB I say that CD is also a straightline which with a medial area makes a medial whole For let BE be an attachment to AB And let the same construction have been made as in the previous propo sitions Thus AE and EB are straightlines which are incommensurable in square making the sum of the squares on them medial and the rectangle contained by them medial and further the sum of the squares on them incommensurable with the rectangle contained by them Prop 1078 And as was shown previously AE and EB are commensurable in length with CF and FD respectively and the sum of the squares on AE and EB with the sum of the squares on CF and FD and the rectangle contained by AE and EB with the rect angle contained by CF and FD Thus CF and FD are also straightlines which are incommensurable in square making the sum of the squares on them medial and the rectangle contained by them medial and fur ther the sum of the squares on them incommensurable with the rectangle contained by them Thus CD is a straightline which with a medial area makes a medial whole Prop 1078 Which is the very thing it was required to show rh Proposition 108 A medial area being subtracted from a rational area one of two irrational straightlines arise as the squareroot of the remaining areaeither an apotome or a minor straightline C L H K G F A E B D For let the medial area BD have been subtracted from the rational area BC I say that one of two ir rational straightlines arise as the squareroot of the remaining area ECeither an apotome or a minor straightline For let the rational straightline FG have been laid out and let the rightangled parallelogram GH equal to BC have been applied to FG and let GK equal to DB have been subtracted from GH Thus the remainder EC is equal to LH Therefore since BC is a rational area and BD a medial area and BC is equal to 411STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 GH and BD to GK GH is thus a rational area and GK a medial area And they are applied to the rational straightline FG Thus FH is rational and commen surable in length with FG Prop 1020 and FK is also rational and incommensurable in length with FG Prop 1022 Thus FH is incommensurable in length with FK Prop 1013 FH and FK are thus rational straightlines which are commensurable in square only Thus KH is an apotome Prop 1073 and KF an at tachment to it So the square on HF is greater than the square on FK by the square on some straight line which is either commensurable or not commensu rable in length with HF First let the square on it be greater by the square on some straightline which is commensurable in length with HF And the whole of HF is com mensurable in length with the previously laid down rational straightline FG Thus KH is a rst apotome Def 101 And the squareroot of an area contained by a rational straightline and a rst apotome is an apo tome Prop 1091 Thus the squareroot of LHthat is to say of ECis an apotome And if the square on HF is greater than the square on FK by the square on some straightline which is incommensurable in length with HF and since the whole of FH is commensurable in length with the pre viously laid down rational straightline FG KH is a fourth apotome Prop 1014 And the squareroot of an area contained by a rational straightline and a fourth apotome is a minor straightline Prop 1094 Which is the very thing it was required to show rj Proposition 109 A rational area being subtracted from a medial area two other irrational straightlines arise as the squareroot of the remaining areaeither a rst apo tome of a medial straightline or that straightline which with a rational area makes a medial whole For let the rational area BD have been subtracted from the medial area BC I say that one of two ir rational straightlines arise as the squareroot of the remaining area ECeither a rst apotome of a medial straightline or that straightline which with a ratio nal area makes a medial whole For let the rational straightline FG be laid down and let similar areas to the preceding proposition have been applied to it So accordingly FH is rational and incommensurable in length with FG and KF is also rational and commensurable in length with FG Thus FH and FK are rational straightlines which are com 412STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 mensurable in square only Prop 1013 KH is thus an apotome Prop 1073 and FK an attachment to it So the square on HF is greater than the square on FK either by the square on some straightline commensu rable in length with HF or by the square on some straightline incommensurable in length with HF G B E D A L K C F H Therefore if the square on HF is greater than the square on FK by the square on some straightline commensurable in length with HF and since the attachment FK is commensurable in length with the previously laid down rational straightline FG KH is a second apotome Def 1012 And FG is rational Hence the squareroot of LHthat is to say of ECis a rst apotome of a medial straightline Prop 1092 And if the square on HF is greater than the square on FK by the square on some straightline incom mensurable in length with HF and since the attach ment FK is commensurable in length with the previ ously laid down rational straightline FG KH is a fth apotome Def 1015 Hence the squareroot of EC is that straightline which with a rational area makes a medial whole Prop 1095 Which is the very thing it was required to show ri Proposition 110 A medial area incommensurable with the whole being subtracted from a medial area the two remaining irrational straightlines arise as the squareroot of the areaeither a second apotome of a medial straight line or that straightline which with a medial area makes a medial whole For as in the previous gures let the medial area BD incommensurable with the whole have been sub tracted from the medial area BC I say that the square root of EC is one of two irrational straightlines either a second apotome of a medial straightline or that straightline which with a medial area makes a medial whole 413STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 G B E D A L K C F H For since BC and BD are each medial areas and BC is incommensurable with BD accordingly FH and FK will each be rational straightlines and incommen surable in length with FG Prop 1022 And since BC is incommensurable with BDthat is to say GH with GKHF is also incommensurable in length with FK Props 61 1011 Thus FH and FK are ratio nal straightlines which are commensurable in square only KH is thus as apotome Prop 1073 and FK an attachment to it So the square on FH is greater than the square on FK either by the square on some straightline commensurable or by the square on some straightline incommensurable in length with FH So if the square on FH is greater than the square on FK by the square on some straightline com mensurable in length with FH and since neither of FH and FK is commensurable in length with the pre viously laid down rational straightline FG KH is a third apotome Def 103 And KL is rational And the rectangle contained by a rational straightline and a third apotome is irrational and the squareroot of it is that irrational straightline called a second apotome of a medial straightline Prop 1093 Hence the square root of LHthat is to say of ECis a second apotome of a medial straightline And if the square on FH is greater than the square on FK by the square on some straightline incom mensurable in length with FH and since neither of HF and FK is commensurable in length with FG KH is a sixth apotome Def 1016 And the squareroot of the rectangle contained by a rational straightline and a sixth apotome is that straightline which with a me dial area makes a medial whole Prop 1096 Thus the squareroot of LHthat is to say of ECis that straightline which with a medial area makes a me dial whole Which is the very thing it was required to 414STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 show ria Proposition 111 An apotome is not the same as a binomial F A D E G C B Let AB be an apotome I say that AB is not the same as a binomial For if possible let it be the same And let a rational straightline DC be laid down And let the rectangle CE equal to the square on AB have been applied to CD producing DE as breadth Therefore since AB is an apotome DE is a rst apotome Prop 1097 Let EF be an attachment to it Thus DF and FE are rational straightlines which are commensurable in square only and the square on DF is greater than the square on FE by the square on some straightline commensurable in length with DF and DF is commensurable in length with the previously laid down rational straight line DC Def 1010 Again since AB is a binomial DE is thus a rst binomial Prop 1060 Let DE have been divided into its component terms at G and let DG be the greater term Thus DG and GE are rational straightlines which are commensurable in square only and the square on DG is greater than the square on GE by the square on some straightline commensu rable in length with DG and the greater term DG is commensurable in length with the previously laid down rational straightline DC Def 105 Thus DF is also commensurable in length with DG Prop 1012 The remainder GF is thus commensurable in length with DF Prop 1015 Therefore since DF is commensu rable with GF and DF is rational GF is thus also ra tional Therefore since DF is commensurable in length with GF DF is incommensurable in length with EF Thus FG is also incommensurable in length with EF Prop 1013 GF and FE are thus rational straight lines which are commensurable in square only Thus 415STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 EG is an apotome Prop 1073 But it is also ratio nal The very thing is impossible Thus an apotome is not the same as a binomial Which is the very thing it was required to show Pri sma Corollary The apotome and the irrational straightlines after it are neither the same as a medial straightline nor the same as one another For the square on a medial straightline applied to a rational straightline produces as breadth a ratio nal straightline which is incommensurable in length with the straightline to which the area is applied Prop 1022 And the square on an apotome ap plied to a rational straightline produces as breadth a rst apotome Prop 1097 And the square on a rst apotome of a medial straightline applied to a ratio nal straightline produces as breadth a second apotome Prop 1098 And the square on a second apotome of a medial straightline applied to a rational straight line produces as breadth a third apotome Prop 1099 And square on a minor straightline applied to a ra tional straightline produces as breadth a fourth apo tome Prop 10100 And square on that straightline which with a rational area produces a medial whole applied to a rational straightline produces as breadth a fth apotome Prop 10101 And square on that straightline which with a medial area produces a medial whole applied to a rational straightline pro duces as breadth a sixth apotome Prop 10102 There fore since the aforementioned breadths differ from the rst breadth and from one anotherfrom the rst be cause it is rational and from one another since they are not the same in orderclearly the irrational straight lines themselves also differ from one another And since it has been shown that an apotome is not the same as a binomial Prop 10111 and that the irrational straightlines after the apotome being applied to a ra tional straightline produce as breadth each according to its own order apotomes and that the irrational straightlines after the binomial themselves also pro duce as breadth according to their order binomials the irrational straightlines after the apotome are thus different and the irrational straightlines after the bi nomial are also different so that there are in order 13 irrational straightlines in all 416STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 Medial Binomial First bimedial Second bimedial Major Squareroot of a rational plus a medial area Squareroot of the sum of two medial areas Apotome First apotome of a medial Second apotome of a medial Minor That which with a rational area produces a medial whole That which with a medial area produces a medial whole rib Proposition 112 The square on a rational straightline applied to a binomial straightline produces as breadth an apo tome whose terms are commensurable in length with the terms of the binomial and furthermore in the same ratio Moreover the created apotome will have the same order as the binomial G B D K E F H C A Let A be a rational straightline and BC a binomial straightline of which let DC be the greater term And let the rectangle contained by BC and EF be equal to the square on A I say that EF is an apotome whose terms are commensurable in length with CD and DB and in the same ratio and moreover that EF will have the same order as BC For again let the rectangle contained by BD and G be equal to the square on A Therefore since the rect angle contained by BC and EF is equal to the rectan gle contained by BD and G thus as CB is to BD so G is to EF Prop 616 And CB is greater than BD Thus G is also greater than EF Props 516 514 Let EH be equal to G Thus as CB is to BD so HE is to EF Thus via separation as CD is to BD so HF is to FE Prop 517 Let it have been contrived that as HF is to FE so FK is to KE And thus the whole HK is to the whole KF as FK is to KE For as one of the leading proportional magnitudes is to one of the 417STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 following so all of the leading magnitudes are to all of the following Prop 512 And as FK is to KE so CD is to DB Prop 511 And thus as HK is to KF so CD is to DB Prop 511 And the square on CD is commensurable with the square on DB Prop 1036 The square on HK is thus also commensurable with the square on KF Props 622 1011 And as the square on HK is to the square on KF so HK is to KE since the three straightlines HK KF and KE are proportional Def 59 HK is thus commensurable in length with KE Prop 1011 Hence HE is also com mensurable in length with EK Prop 1015 And since the square on A is equal to the rectangle contained by EH and BD and the square on A is rational the rect angle contained by EH and BD is thus also rational And it is applied to the rational straightline BD Thus EH is rational and commensurable in length with BD Prop 1020 And hence the straightline commensu rable in length with it EK is also rational Def 103 and commensurable in length with BD Prop 1012 Therefore since as CD is to DB so FK is to KE and CD and DB are straightlines which are commensu rable in square only FK and KE are also commensu rable in square only Prop 1011 And KE is rational Thus FK is also rational FK and KE are thus rational straightlines which are commensurable in square only Thus EF is an apotome Prop 1073 And the square on CD is greater than the square on DB either by the square on some straightline com mensurable or by the square on some straightline incommensurable in length with CD Therefore if the square on CD is greater than the square on DB by the square on some straightline commensurable in length with CD then the square on FK will also be greater than the square on KE by the square on some straightline commensurable in length with FK Prop 1014 And if CD is com mensurable in length with a previously laid down ra tional straightline so also is FK Props 1011 1012 And if BD is commensurable so also is KE Prop 1012 And if neither of CD or DB is com mensurable neither also are either of FK or KE And if the square on CD is greater than the square on DB by the square on some straightline incom mensurable in length with CD then the square on FK will also be greater than the square on KE by the square on some straightline incommensurable in length with FK Prop 1014 And if CD is com mensurable in length with a previously laid down ra tional straightline so also is FK Props 1011 1012 And if BD is commensurable so also is KE 418STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 Prop 1012 And if neither of CD or DB is commen surable neither also are either of FK or KE Hence FE is an apotome whose terms FK and KE are com mensurable in length with the terms CD and DB of the binomial and in the same ratio And FE has the same order as BC Defs 1051010 Which is the very thing it was required to show Heiberg considers this proposition and the succeeding ones to be relatively early interpolations into the original text rig Proposition 113 The square on a rational straightline applied to an apotome produces as breadth a binomial whose terms are commensurable with the terms of the apotome and in the same ratio Moreover the created binomial has the same order as the apotome A B D K E C F H G Let A be a rational straightline and BD an apo tome And let the rectangle contained by BD and KH be equal to the square on A such that the square on the rational straightline A applied to the apotome BD produces KH as breadth I say that KH is a binomial whose terms are commensurable with the terms of BD and in the same ratio and moreover that KH has the same order as BD For let DC be an attachment to BD Thus BC and CD are rational straightlines which are commensu rable in square only Prop 1073 And let the rectangle contained by BC and G also be equal to the square on A And the square on A is rational The rect angle contained by BC and G is thus also rational And it has been applied to the rational straightline BC Thus G is rational and commensurable in length with BC Prop 1020 Therefore since the rectangle contained by BC and G is equal to the rectangle con tained by BD and KH thus proportionally as CB is to BD so KH is to G Prop 616 And BC is greater than BD Thus KH is also greater than G Prop 516 514 Let KE be made equal to G KE is thus com mensurable in length with BC And since as CB is to BD so HK is to KE thus via conversion as BC is to CD so KH is to HE Prop 519 corr Let it have been contrived that as KH is to HE so HF is to FE And thus the remainder KF is to FH as KH is to HEthat is to say as BC is to CD Prop 519 And BC and CD are commensurable in square only 419STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 KF and FH are thus also commensurable in square only Prop 1011 And since as KH is to HE so KF is to FH but as KH is to HE so HF is to FE thus also as KF is to FH so HF is to FE Prop 511 And hence as the rst is to the third so the square on the rst is to the square on the second Def 59 And thus as KF is to FE so the square on KF is to the square on FH And the square on KF is commen surable with the square on FH For KF and FH are commensurable in square Thus KF is also commensu rable in length with FE Prop 1011 Hence KF is also commensurable in length with KE Prop 1015 And KE is rational and commensurable in length with BC Thus KF is also rational and commensurable in length with BC Prop 1012 And since as BC is to CD so KF is to FH alternately as BC is to KF so DC is to FH Prop 516 And BC is commen surable in length with KF Thus FH is also com mensurable in length with CD Prop 1011 And BC and CD are rational straightlines which are commen surable in square only KF and FH are thus also ratio nal straightlines which are commensurable in square only Def 103 Prop 1013 Thus KH is a binomial Prop 1036 Therefore if the square on BC is greater than the square on CD by the square on some straightline commensurable in length with BC then the square on KF will also be greater than the square on FH by the square on some straightline commensurable in length with KF Prop 1014 And if BC is com mensurable in length with a previously laid down ra tional straightline so also is KF Prop 1012 And if CD is commensurable in length with a previ ously laid down rational straightline so also is FH Prop 1012 And if neither of BC or CD are commensurable neither also are either of KF or FH Prop 1013 And if the square on BC is greater than the square on CD by the square on some straightline incom mensurable in length with BC then the square on KF will also be greater than the square on FH by the square on some straightline incommensurable in length with KF Prop 1014 And if BC is com mensurable in length with a previously laid down ratio nal straightline so also is KF Prop 1012 And if CD is commensurable so also is FH Prop 1012 And if neither of BC or CD are commensurable nei ther also are either of KF or FH Prop 1013 KH is thus a binomial whose terms KF and FH are commensurable in length with the terms BC and CD of the apotome and in the same ratio Moreover 420STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 KH will have the same order as BC Defs 1051010 Which is the very thing it was required to show rid Proposition 114 If an area is contained by an apotome and a binomial whose terms are commensurable with and in the same ratio as the terms of the apotome then the squareroot of the area is a rational straightline D A B E K L M C G H F For let an area the rectangle contained by AB and CD have been contained by the apotome AB and the binomial CD of which let the greater term be CE And let the terms of the binomial CE and ED be commen surable with the terms of the apotome AF and FB re spectively and in the same ratio And let the squareroot of the rectangle contained by AB and CD be G I say that G is a rational straightline For let the rational straightline H be laid down And let some rectangle equal to the square on H have been applied to CD producing KL as breadth Thus KL is an apotome of which let the terms KM and ML be commensurable with the terms of the bino mial CE and ED respectively and in the same ratio Prop 10112 But CE and ED are also commensu rable with AF and FB respectively and in the same ra tio Thus as AF is to FB so KM is to ML Thus alter nately as AF is to KM so BF is to LM Prop 516 Thus the remainder AB is also to the remainder KL as AF is to KM Prop 519 And AF is commensu rable with KM Prop 1012 AB is thus also commen surable with KL Prop 1011 And as AB is to KL so the rectangle contained by CD and AB is to the rectangle contained by CD and KL Prop 61 Thus the rectangle contained by CD and AB is also com mensurable with the rectangle contained by CD and KL Prop 1011 And the rectangle contained by CD and KL is equal to the square on H Thus the rect angle contained by CD and AB is commensurable with the square on H And the square on G is equal to the rectangle contained by CD and AB The square on G 421STOIQEIWN i ELEMENTS BOOK 10 is thus commensurable with the square on H And the square on H is rational Thus the square on G is also rational G is thus rational And it is the squareroot of the rectangle contained by CD and AB Thus if an area is contained by an apotome and a binomial whose terms are commensurable with and in the same ratio as the terms of the apotome then the squareroot of the area is a rational straightline Pri sma Corollary And it has also been made clear to us through this that it is possible for a rational area to be contained by irrational straightlines Which is the very thing it was required to show rie Proposition 115 An innite series of irrational straightlines can be created from a medial straightline and none of them is the same as any of the preceding straightlines C B D A Let A be a medial straightline I say that an in nite series of irrational straightlines can be created from A and that none of them is the same as any of the preceding straightlines Let the rational straightline B be laid down And let the square on C be equal to the rectangle con tained by B and A Thus C is irrational Def 104 For an area contained by an irrational and a rational straightline is irrational Prop 1020 And C is not the same as any of the preceding straightlines For the square on none of the preceding straightlines applied to a rational straightline produces a medial straightline as breadth So again let the square on D be equal to the rectangle contained by B and C Thus the square on D is irrational Prop 1020 D is thus irrational Def 104 And D is not the same as any of the preceding straightlines For the square on none of the preceding straightlines applied to a ratio nal straightline produces C as breadth So similarly this arrangement being advanced to innity it is clear that an innite series of irrational straightlines can be created from a medial straightline and that none of them is the same as any of the preceding straightlines Which is the very thing it was required to show 422ELEMENTS BOOK 11 Elementary Stereometry 423STOIQEIWN ia ELEMENTS BOOK 11 V Oroi Denitions 1 A solid is a gure having length and breadth and depth 2 The extremity of a solid is a surface 3 A straightline is at rightangles to a plane when it makes rightangles with all of the straightlines joined to it which are also in the plane 4 A plane is at rightangles to another plane when all of the straightlines drawn in one of the planes at rightangles to the common section of the planes are at rightangles to the remaining plane 5 The inclination of a straightline to a plane is the angle contained by the drawn and standing straight lines when a perpendicular is lead to the plane from the end of the standing straightline raised out of the plane and a straightline is then joined from the point so generated to the end of the standing straightline lying in the plane 6 The inclination of a plane to another plane is the acute angle contained by the straightlines one in each of the planes drawn at rightangles to the common segment of the planes at the same point 7 A plane is said to have been similarly inclined to a plane as another to another when the aforementioned angles of inclination are equal to one another 8 Parallel planes are those which do not meet one another 9 Similar solid gures are those contained by equal numbers of similar planes which are similarly arranged 10 But equal and similar solid gures are those con tained by similar planes equal in number and in magni tude which are similarly arranged 11 A solid angle is the inclination constituted by more than two lines joining one another at the same point and not being in the same surface to all of the lines Otherwise a solid angle is that contained by more than two plane angles not being in the same plane and constructed at one point 12 A pyramid is a solid gure contained by planes which is constructed from one plane to one point 13 A prism is a solid gure contained by planes of which the two opposite planes are equal similar and parallel and the remaining planes are parallelograms 14 A sphere is the gure enclosed when the diam eter of a semicircle remaining xed the semicircle is carried around and again established at the same posi tion from which it began to be moved 15 And the axis of the sphere is the xed straightline about which the semicircle is turned 424STOIQEIWN ia ELEMENTS BOOK 11 16 And the center of the sphere is the same as that of the semicircle 17 And the diameter of the sphere is any straight line which is drawn through the center and terminated in both directions by the surface of the sphere 18 A cone is the gure enclosed when one of the sides of a rightangled triangle about the rightangle re maining xed the triangle is carried around and again established at the same position from which it began to be moved And if the xed straightline is equal to the re maining straightline about the rightangle which is carried around then the cone will be rightangled and if less obtuseangled and if greater acuteangled 19 And the axis of the cone is the xed straightline about which the triangle is turned 20 And the base of the cone is the circle described by the remaining straightline about the rightangle which is carried around the axis 21 A cylinder is the gure enclosed when one of the sides of a rightangled parallelogram about the right angle remaining xed the parallelogram is carried around and again established at the same position from which it began to be moved 22 And the axis of the cylinder is the stationary straightline about which the parallelogram is turned 23 And the bases of the cylinder are the circles described by the two opposite sides which are carried around 24 Similar cones and cylinders are those for which the axes and the diameters of the bases are proportional 25 A cube is a solid gure contained by six equal squares 26 An octahedron is a solid gure contained by eight equal and equilateral triangles 27 An icosahedron is a solid gure contained by twenty equal and equilateral triangles 28 A dodecahedron is a solid gure contained by twelve equal equilateral and equiangular pentagons a Proposition 1 Some part of a straightline cannot be in a reference plane and some part in a more elevated plane For if possible let some part AB of the straightline ABC be in a reference plane and some part BC in a more elevated plane v In the reference plane there will be some straightline continuous with and straighton to AB Let it be BD Thus AB is a common segment of the two different straightlines ABC and ABD The very thing is impos sible inasmuch as if we draw a circle with center B and 425STOIQEIWN ia ELEMENTS BOOK 11 radius AB then the diameters ABD and ABC will cut off unequal circumferences of the circle D A B C Thus some part of a straightline cannot be in a refer ence plane and some part in a more elevated plane Which is the very thing it was required to show The proofs of the rst three propositions in this book are not at all rigorous Hence these three propositions should properly be regarded as additional axioms This assumption essentially presupposes the validity of the proposition under discussion b Proposition 2 If two straightlines cut one another then they are in one plane and every triangle formed using segments of both lines is in one plane D K B A C H F G E For let the two straightlines AB and CD have cut one another at point E I say that AB and CD are in one plane and that every triangle formed using segments of both lines is in one plane For let the random points F and G have been taken on EC and EB respectively And let CB and FG have been joined and let FH and GK have been drawn across I say rst of all that triangle ECB is in one ref erence plane For if part of triangle ECB either FHC 426STOIQEIWN ia ELEMENTS BOOK 11 or GBK is in the reference plane and the remainder in a different plane then a part of one the straightlines EC and EB will also be in the reference plane and a part in a different plane And if the part FCBG of tri angle ECB is in the reference plane and the remainder in a different plane then parts of both of the straight lines EC and EB will also be in the reference plane and parts in a different plane The very thing was shown to be absurb Prop 111 Thus triangle ECB is in one plane And in whichever plane triangle ECB is found in that plane EC and EB will each also be found And in whichever plane EC and EB are each found in that plane AB and CD will also be found Prop 111 Thus the straightlines AB and CD are in one plane and every triangle formed using seg ments of both lines is in one plane Which is the very thing it was required to show g Proposition 3 If two planes cut one another then their common sec tion is a straightline A E B C F D For let the two planes AB and BC cut one another and let their common section be the line DB I say that the line DB is straight For if not let the straightline DEB have been joined from D to B in the plane AB and the straightline DFB in the plane BC So two straightlines DEB and DFB will have the same ends and they will clearly enclose an area The very thing is absurd Thus DEB and DFB are not straightlines So similarly we can show than no other straightline can be joined from D to B except DB the common section of the planes AB and BC Thus if two planes cut one another then their com mon section is a straightline Which is the very thing it was required to show 427STOIQEIWN ia ELEMENTS BOOK 11 d Proposition 4 If a straightline is set up at rightangles to two straightlines cutting one another at the common point of section then it will also be at rightangles to the plane passing through them both A B D E C H F G For let some straightline EF have been set up at rightangles to two straightlines AB and CD cutting one another at point E at E I say that EF is also at rightangles to the plane passing through AB and CD For let AE EB CE and ED have been cut off from the two straightlines so as to be equal to one another And let GEH have been drawn at random through E in the plane passing through AB and CD And let AD and CB have been joined And furthermore let FA FG FD FC FH and FB have been joined from the random point F on EF For since the two straightlines AE and ED are equal to the two straightlines CE and EB and they enclose equal angles Prop 115 the base AD is thus equal to the base CB and triangle AED will be equal to triangle CEB Prop 14 Hence the angle DAE is equal to the angle EBC And the angle AEG is also equal to the angle BEH Prop 115 So AGE and BEH are two triangles having two angles equal to two angles respectively and one side equal to one side namely those by the equal angles AE and EB Thus they will also have the remaining sides equal to the re maining sides Prop 126 Thus GE is equal to EH and AG to BH And since AE is equal to EB and FE is common and at rightangles the base FA is thus equal to the base FB Prop 14 So for the same reasons FC is also equal to FD And since AD is equal to CB and FA is also equal to FB the two straightlines FA and AD are equal to the two straightlines FB and BC respectively And the base FD was shown to be equal to the base FC Thus the angle FAD is also equal to the angle FBC Prop 18 And again since AG was shown to be equal to BH but FA is also equal to 428STOIQEIWN ia ELEMENTS BOOK 11 FB the two straightlines FA and AG are equal to the two straightlines FB and BH respectively And the angle FAG was shown to be equal to the angle FBH Thus the base FG is equal to the base FH Prop 14 And again since GE was shown to be equal to EH and EF is common the two straightlines GE and EF are equal to the two straightlines HE and EF respectively And the base FG is equal to the base FH Thus the angle GEF is equal to the angle HEF Prop 18 Each of the angles GEF and HEF are thus rightangles Def 110 Thus FE is at rightangles to GH which was drawn at random through E in the reference plane passing though AB and AC So simi larly we can show that FE will make rightangles with all straightlines joined to it which are in the reference plane And a straightline is at rightangles to a plane when it makes rightangles with all straightlines joined to it which are in the plane Def 113 Thus FE is at rightangles to the reference plane And the reference plane is that passing through the straightlines AB and CD Thus FE is at rightangles to the plane passing through AB and CD Thus if a straightline is set up at rightangles to two straightlines cutting one another at the common point of section then it will also be at rightangles to the plane passing through them both Which is the very thing it was required to show e Proposition 5 If a straightline is set up at rightangles to three straightlines cutting one another at the common point of section then the three straightlines are in one plane F D E B A C For let some straightline AB have been set up at rightangles to three straightlines BC BD and BE at the common point of section B I say that BC BD and BE are in one plane For if not and if possible let BD and BE be in the reference plane and BC in a more elevated plane 429STOIQEIWN ia ELEMENTS BOOK 11 And let the plane through AB and BC have been pro duced So it will make a straightline as a common sec tion with the reference plane Def 113 Let it make BF Thus the three straightlines AB BC and BF are in one planenamely that drawn through AB and BC And since AB is at rightangles to each of BD and BE AB is thus also at rightangles to the plane passing through BD and BE Prop 114 And the plane pass ing through BD and BE is the reference plane Thus AB is at rightangles to the reference plane Hence AB will also make rightangles with all straightlines joined to it which are also in the reference plane Def 113 And BF which is in the reference plane is joined to it Thus the angle ABF is a rightangle And ABC was also assumed to be a rightangle Thus angle ABF is equal to ABC And they are in one plane The very thing is impossible Thus BC is not in a more elevated plane Thus the three straightlines BC BD and BE are in one plane Thus if a straightline is set up at rightangles to three straightlines cutting one another at the common point of section then the three straightlines are in one plane Which is the very thing it was required to show Proposition 6 If two straightlines are at rightangles to the same plane then the straightlines will be parallel B G D E A C D E A B For let the two straightlines AB and CD be at right angles to a reference plane I say that AB is parallel to CD For let them meet the reference plane at points B and D respectively And let the straightline BD have been joined And let DE have been drawn at rightangles to BD in the reference plane And let DE be made equal to AB And let BE AE and AD have been joined And since AB is at rightangles to the reference plane it will thus also make rightangles with all straightlines joined to it which are in the reference plane Def 113 430STOIQEIWN ia ELEMENTS BOOK 11 And BD and BE which are in the reference plane are each joined to AB Thus each of the angles ABD and ABE are rightangles So for the same reasons each of the angles CDB and CDE are also rightangles And since AB is equal to DE and BD is common the two straightlines AB and BD are equal to the two straightlines ED and DB respectively And they contain rightangles Thus the base AD is equal to the base BE Prop 14 And since AB is equal to DE and AD is also equal to BE the two straightlines AB and BE are thus equal to the two straightlines ED and DA respectively And their base AE is common Thus angle ABE is equal to angle EDA Prop 18 And ABE is a rightangle Thus EDA is also a right angle ED is thus at rightangles to DA And it is also at rightangles to each of BD and DC Thus ED is stand ing at rightangles to the three straightlines BD DA and DC at the common point of section Thus the three straightlines BD DA and DC are in one plane Prop 115 And in whichever plane DB and DA are found in that plane AB will also be found For every triangle is in one plane Prop 112 And each of the angles ABD and BDC is a rightangle Thus AB is parallel to CD Prop 128 Thus if two straightlines are at rightangles to the same plane then the straightlines will be parallel Which is the very thing it was required to show In other words the two straightlines lie in the same plane and never meet when produced in either direction z Proposition 7 If there are two parallel straightlines and random points are taken on each of them then the straightline joining the two points is in the same plane as the parallel straightlines H A E B D Z G G A E B D C F Let AB and CD be two parallel straightlines and let the random points E and F have been taken on each of them respectively I say that the straightline joining points E and F is in the same reference plane as the parallel straightlines For if not and if possible let it be in a more elevated 431STOIQEIWN ia ELEMENTS BOOK 11 plane such as EGF And let a plane have been drawn through EGF So it will make a straight cutting in the reference plane Prop 113 Let it make EF Thus two straightlines with the same endpoints EGF and EF will enclose an area The very thing is impossible Thus the straightline joining E to F is not in a more elevated plane The straightline joining E to F is thus in the plane through the parallel straightlines AB and CD Thus if there are two parallel straightlines and ran dom points are taken on each of them then the straight line joining the two points is in the same plane as the parallel straightlines Which is the very thing it was required to show h Proposition 8 If two straightlines are parallel and one of them is at rightangles to some plane then the remaining one will also be at rightangles to the same plane D A E B G D A E B C Let AB and CD be two parallel straightlines and let one of them AB be at rightangles to a reference plane I say that the remaining one CD will also be at right angles to the same plane For let AB and CD meet the reference plane at points B and D respectively And let BD have been joined AB CD and BD are thus in one plane Prop 117 Let DE have been drawn at rightangles to BD in the reference plane and let DE be made equal to AB and let BE AE and AD have been joined And since AB is at rightangles to the reference plane AB is thus also at rightangles to all of the straightlines joined to it which are in the reference plane Def 113 Thus the angles ABD and ABE are each rightangles And since the straightline BD has met the parallel straightlines AB and CD the sum of the angles ABD and CDB is thus equal to two rightangles 432STOIQEIWN ia ELEMENTS BOOK 11 Prop 129 And ABD is a rightangle Thus CDB is also a rightangle CD is thus at rightangles to BD And since AB is equal to DE and BD is common the two straightlines AB and BD are equal to the two straightlines ED and DB respectively And angle ABD is equal to angle EDB For each is a right angle Thus the base AD is equal to the base BE Prop 14 And since AB is equal to DE and BE to AD the two sides AB BE are equal to the two sides ED DA respectively And their base AE is common Thus angle ABE is equal to angle EDA Prop 18 And ABE is a rightangle EDA is thus also a right angle Thus ED is at rightangles to AD And it is also at rightangles to DB Thus ED is also at rightangles to the plane through BD and DA Prop 114 And ED will thus make rightangles with all of the straight lines joined to it which are also in the plane through BDA And DC is in the plane through BDA inas much as AB and BD are in the plane through BDA Prop 112 and in whichever plane AB and BD are found DC is also found Thus ED is at rightangles to DC Hence CD is also at rightangles to DE And CD is also at rightangles to BD Thus CD is standing at rightangles to two straightlines DE and DB which meet one another at the point of section D Hence CD is also at rightangles to the plane through DE and DB Prop 114 And the plane through DE and DB is the reference plane CD is thus at rightangles to the reference plane Thus if two straightlines are parallel and one of them is at rightangles to some plane then the remain ing one will also be at rightangles to the same plane Which is the very thing it was required to show j Proposition 9 Straightlines parallel to the same straightline and which are not in the same plane as it are also parallel to one another E B Z H A D G K J E B A D K F C H G For let AB and CD each be parallel to EF not being in the same plane as it I say that AB is parallel to CD 433STOIQEIWN ia ELEMENTS BOOK 11 For let some point G have been taken at random on EF And from it let GH have been drawn at rightangles to EF in the plane through EF and AB And let GK have been drawn again at rightangles to EF in the plane through FE and CD And since EF is at rightangles to each of GH and GK EF is thus also at rightangles to the plane through GH and GK Prop 114 And EF is parallel to AB Thus AB is also at rightangles to the plane through HGK Prop 118 So for the same reasons CD is also at rightangles to the plane through HGK Thus AB and CD are each at rightangles to the plane through HGK And if two straightlines are at rightangles to the same plane then the straightlines are parallel Prop 116 Thus AB is parallel to CD Which is the very thing it was required to show i Proposition 10 If two straightlines joined to one another are respec tively parallel to two straightlines joined to one another but are not in the same plane then they will contain equal angles A D Z E B G C D E B A F For let the two straightlines joined to one another AB and BC be respectively parallel to the two straightlines joined to one another DE and EF but not in the same plane I say that angle ABC is equal to angle DEF For let BA BC ED and EF have been cut off so as to be respectively equal to one another And let AD CF BE AC and DF have been joined And since BA is equal and parallel to ED AD is thus also equal and parallel to BE Prop 133 So for the same reasons CF is also equal and parallel to BE Thus AD and CF are each equal and parallel to BE And straightlines parallel to the same straightline and which are not in the same plane as it are also parallel to one an other Prop 119 Thus AD is parallel and equal to CF And AC and DF join them Thus AC is also equal and 434STOIQEIWN ia ELEMENTS BOOK 11 parallel to DF Prop 133 And since the two straight lines AB and BC are equal to the two straightlines DE and EF respectvely and the base AC is equal to the base DF the angle ABC is thus equal to the angle DEF Prop 18 Thus if two straightlines joined to one another are respectively parallel to two straightlines joined to one another but are not in the same plane then they will contain equal angles Which is the very thing it was required to show ia Proposition 11 To draw a perpendicular straightline from a given raised point to a given plane Z G J D B H E A H D B E A F C G Let A be the given raised point and the given plane the reference plane So it is required to draw a perpen dicular straightline from point A to the reference plane Let some random straightline BC have been drawn across in the reference plane and let the straightline AD have been drawn from point A perpendicular to BC Prop 112 If therefore AD is also perpendicular to the reference plane then that which was prescribed will have occurred And if not let DE have been drawn in the reference plane from point D at rightangles to BC Prop 111 and let the straightline AF have been drawn from A perpendicular to DE Prop 112 and let GH have been drawn through point F parallel to BC Prop 131 And since BC is at rightangles to each of DA and DE BC is thus also at rightangles to the plane through EDA Prop 114 And GH is parallel to it And if two straightlines are parallel and one of them is at right angles to some plane then the remaining straightline will also be at rightangles to the same plane Prop 118 Thus GH is also at rightangles to the plane through 435STOIQEIWN ia ELEMENTS BOOK 11 ED and DA And GH is thus at rightangles to all of the straightlines joined to it which are also in the plane through ED and AD Def 113 And AF which is in the plane through ED and DA is joined to it Thus GH is at rightangles to FA Hence FA is also at rightangles to HG And AF is also at rightangles to DE Thus AF is at rightangles to each of GH and DE And if a straight line is set up at rightangles to two straightlines cutting one another at the point of section then it will also be at rightangles to the plane through them Prop 114 Thus FA is at rightangles to the plane through ED and GH And the plane through ED and GH is the refer ence plane Thus AF is at rightangles to the reference plane Thus the straightline AF has been drawn from the given raised point A perpendicular to the reference plane Which is the very thing it was required to do ib Proposition 12 To set up a straightline at rightangles to a given plane from a given point in it G A D B B A D C Let the given plane be the reference plane and A a point in it So it is required to set up a straightline at rightangles to the reference plane at point A Let some raised point B have been assumed and let the perpendicular straightline BC have been drawn from B to the reference plane Prop 1111 And let AD have been drawn from point A parallel to BC Prop 131 Therefore since AD and CB are two parallel straight lines and one of them BC is at rightangles to the refer ence plane the remaining one AD is thus also at right angles to the reference plane Prop 118 436STOIQEIWN ia ELEMENTS BOOK 11 Thus AD has been set up at rightangles to the given plane from the point in it A Which is the very thing it was required to do ig Proposition 13 Two different straightlines cannot be set up at the same point at rightangles to the same plane on the same side D A B E G C A B E D For if possible let the two straightlines AB and AC have been set up at the same point A at rightangles to the reference plane on the same side And let the plane through BA and AC have been drawn So it will make a straight cutting passing through point A in the reference plane Prop 113 Let it have made DAE Thus AB AC and DAE are straightlines in one plane And since CA is at rightangles to the reference plane it will thus also make rightangles with all of the straight lines joined to it which are also in the reference plane Def 113 And DAE which is in the reference plane is joined to it Thus angle CAE is a rightangle So for the same reasons BAE is also a rightangle Thus CAE is equal to BAE And they are in one plane The very thing is impossible Thus two different straightlines cannot be set up at the same point at rightangles to the same plane on the same side Which is the very thing it was required to show id Proposition 14 Planes to which the same straightline is at right angles will be parallel planes For let some straightline AB be at rightangles to each of the planes CD and EF I say that the planes are parallel 437STOIQEIWN ia ELEMENTS BOOK 11 E A B H G Z D J K C A B D K E F H G For if not being produced they will meet Let them have met So they will make a straightline as a common section Prop 113 Let them have made GH And let some random point K have been taken on GH And let AK and BK have been joined And since AB is at rightangles to the plane EF AB is thus also at rightangles to BK which is a straightline in the produced plane EF Def 113 Thus angle ABK is a rightangle So for the same reasons BAK is also a rightangle So the sum of the two angles ABK and BAK in the triangle ABK is equal to two rightangles The very thing is impossible Prop 117 Thus planes CD and EF being produced will not meet Planes CD and EF are thus parallel Def 118 Thus planes to which the same straightline is at rightangles are parallel planes Which is the very thing it was required to show ie Proposition 15 If two straightlines joined to one another are parallel respectively to two straightlines joined to one another which are not in the same plane then the planes through them are parallel to one another For let the two straightlines joined to one another AB and BC be parallel to the two straightlines joined to one another DE and EF respectively not being in the same plane I say that the planes through AB BC and DE EF will not meet one another when produced For let BG have been drawn from point B perpendic ular to the plane through DE and EF Prop 1111 and let it meet the plane at point G And let GH have been drawn through G parallel to ED and GK parallel to EF Prop 131 438STOIQEIWN ia ELEMENTS BOOK 11 H Z D B A G E K J G D B A E K C H F And since BG is at rightangles to the plane through DE and EF it will thus also make rightangles with all of the straightlines joined to it which are also in the plane through DE and EF Def 113 And each of GH and GK which are in the plane through DE and EF are joined to it Thus each of the angles BGH and BGK are rightangles And since BA is parallel to GH Prop 119 the sum of the angles GBA and BGH is equal to two rightangles Prop 129 And BGH is a rightangle GBA is thus also a rightangle Thus GB is at rightangles to BA So for the same reasons GB is also at rightangles to BC Therefore since the straightline GB has been set up at rightangles to two straightlines BA and BC cutting one another GB is thus at rightangles to the plane through BA and BC Prop 114 So for the same reasons BG is also at rightangles to the plane through GH and GK And the plane through GH and GK is the plane through DE and EF And it was also shown that GB is at right angles to the plane through AB and BC And planes to which the same straightline is at rightangles are par allel planes Prop 1114 Thus the plane through AB and BC is parallel to the plane through DE and EF Thus if two straightlines joined to one another are parallel respectively to two straightlines joined to one another which are not in the same plane then the planes through them are parallel to one another Which is the very thing it was required to show i Proposition 16 If two parallel planes are cut by some plane then their common sections are parallel For let the two parallel planes AB and CD have been cut by the plane EFGH And let EF and GH be their common sections I say that EF is parallel to GH 439STOIQEIWN ia ELEMENTS BOOK 11 D J K E H G A Z B F K E A B D G C H For if not being produced EF and GH will meet ei ther in the direction of F H or of E G Let them be produced as in the direction of F H and let them rst of all have met at K And since EFK is in the plane AB all of the points on EFK are thus also in the plane AB Prop 111 And K is one of the points on EFK Thus K is in the plane AB So for the same reasons K is also in the plane CD Thus the planes AB and CD being produced will meet But they do not meet on ac count of being initially assumed to be mutually paral lel Thus the straightlines EF and GH being produced in the direction of F H will not meet So similarly we can show that the straightlines EF and GH being pro duced in the direction of E G will not meet either And straightlines in one plane which being produced do not meet in either direction are parallel Def 123 EF is thus parallel to GH Thus if two parallel planes are cut by some plane then their common sections are parallel Which is the very thing it was required to show iz Proposition 17 If two straightlines are cut by parallel planes then they will be cut in the same ratios For let the two straightlines AB and CD be cut by the parallel planes GH KL and MN at the points A E B and C F D respectively I say that as the straightline AE is to EB so CF is to FD For let AC BD and AD have been joined and let AD meet the plane KL at point O and let EO and OF have been joined And since two parallel planes KL and MN are cut by the plane EBDO their common sections EO and BD are parallel Prop 1116 So for the same reasons since two parallel planes GH and KL are cut by the plane AOFC their common sections AC and OF are parallel Prop 1116 And since the straightline EO has been drawn parallel to one of the sides BD of trian 440STOIQEIWN ia ELEMENTS BOOK 11 gle ABD thus proportionally as AE is to EB so AO is to OD Prop 62 Again since the straightline OF has been drawn parallel to one of the sides AC of trian gle ADC proportionally as AO is to OD so CF is to FD Prop 62 And it was also shown that as AO is to OD so AE is to EB And thus as AE is to EB so CF is to FD Prop 511 Z K N B D M H J A L E G X F K N B D M A L E C G H O Thus if two straightlines are cut by parallel planes then they will be cut in the same ratios Which is the very thing it was required to show ih Proposition 18 If a straightline is at rightangles to some plane then all of the planes passing through it will also be at right angles to the same plane For let some straightline AB be at rightangles to a reference plane I say that all of the planes pass ing through AB are also at rightangles to the reference plane For let the plane DE have been produced through AB And let CE be the common section of the plane DE and the reference plane And let some random point F have been taken on CE And let FG have been drawn from F at rightangles to CE in the plane DE Prop 111 And since AB is at rightangles to the reference plane AB is thus also at rightangles to all of the straight lines joined to it which are also in the reference plane Def 113 Hence it is also at rightangles to CE Thus angle ABF is a rightangle And GFB is also a right angle Thus AB is parallel to FG Prop 128 And AB is at rightangles to the reference plane Thus FG is also 441STOIQEIWN ia ELEMENTS BOOK 11 at rightangles to the reference plane Prop 118 And a plane is at rightangles to another plane when the straightlines drawn at rightangles to the common sec tion of the planes and lying in one of the planes are at rightangles to the remaining plane Def 114 And FG which was drawn at rightangles to the common section of the planes CE in one of the planes DE was shown to be at rightangles to the reference plane Thus plane DE is at rightangles to the reference plane So similarly it can be shown that all of the planes passing at random through AB are at rightangles to the refer ence plane Z D H A E G B G D A E B C F Thus if a straightline is at rightangles to some plane then all of the planes passing through it will also be at rightangles to the same plane Which is the very thing it was required to show ij Proposition 19 If two planes cutting one another are at rightangles to some plane then their common section will also be at rightangles to the same plane D A G Z E B F A E B D C For let the two planes AB and BC be at rightangles to a reference plane and let their common section be BD I say that BD is at rightangles to the reference 442STOIQEIWN ia ELEMENTS BOOK 11 plane For if not let DE also have been drawn from point D in the plane AB at rightangles to the straightline AD and DF in the plane BC at rightangles to CD And since the plane AB is at rightangles to the refer ence plane and DE has been drawn at rightangles to their common section AD in the plane AB DE is thus at rightangles to the reference plane Def 114 So simi larly we can show that DF is also at rightangles to the reference plane Thus two different straightlines are set up at the same point D at rightangles to the refer ence plane on the same side The very thing is impossible Prop 1113 Thus no other straightline except the common section DB of the planes AB and BC can be set up at point D at rightangles to the reference plane Thus if two planes cutting one another are at right angles to some plane then their common section will also be at rightangles to the same plane Which is the very thing it was required to show k Proposition 20 If a solid angle is contained by three plane angles then the sum of any two angles is greater than the remain ing one the angles being taken up in any possible way E G B D A E B D A C For let the solid angle A have been contained by the three plane angles BAC CAD and DAB I say that the sum of any two of the angles BAC CAD and DAB is greater than the remaining one the angles being taken up in any possible way For if the angles BAC CAD and DAB are equal to one another then it is clear that the sum of any two is greater than the remaining one But if not let BAC be greater than CAD or DAB And let angle BAE equal to the angle DAB have been constructed in the plane through BAC on the straightline AB at the point A on it And let AE be made equal to AD And BEC be ing drawn across through point E let it cut the straight lines AB and AC at points B and C respectively And let DB and DC have been joined And since DA is equal to AE and AB is common 443STOIQEIWN ia ELEMENTS BOOK 11 the two straightlines AD and AB are equal to the two straightlines EA and AB respectively And an gle DAB is equal to angle BAE Thus the base DB is equal to the base BE Prop 14 And since the sum of the two straightlines BD and DC is greater than BC Prop 120 of which DB was shown to be equal to BE the remainder DC is thus greater than the re mainder EC And since DA is equal to AE but AC is common and the base DC is greater than the base EC the angle DAC is thus greater than the angle EAC Prop 125 And DAB was also shown to be equal to BAE Thus the sum of DAB and DAC is greater than BAC So similarly we can also show that the remain ing angles being taken in pairs are greater than the remaining one Thus if a solid angle is contained by three plane an gles then the sum of any two angles is greater than the remaining one the angles being taken up in any possible way Which is the very thing it was required to show ka Proposition 21 Any solid angle is contained by plane angles whose sum is less than four rightangles G A D B A D C B Let the solid angle A be contained by the plane angles BAC CAD and DAB I say that the sum of BAC CAD and DAB is less than four rightangles For let the random points B C and D have been taken on each of the straightlines AB AC and AD respectively And let BC CD and DB have been joined And since the solid angle at B is contained by the three plane angles CBA ABD and CBD the sum of any two is greater than the remaining one Prop 1120 Thus the sum of CBA and ABD is greater than CBD So for the same reasons the sum of BCA and ACD is also greater than BCD and the sum of CDA and ADB is greater than CDB Thus the sum of the six angles CBA ABD BCA ACD CDA and ADB is greater than the sum of the three angles CBD BCD and CDB But the sum of the three angles CBD BDC and BCD is equal to two 444STOIQEIWN ia ELEMENTS BOOK 11 rightangles Prop 132 Thus the sum of the six an gles CBA ABD BCA ACD CDA and ADB is greater than two rightangles And since the sum of the three angles of each of the triangles ABC ACD and ADB is equal to two rightangles the sum of the nine angles CBA ACB BAC ACD CDA CAD ADB DBA and BAD of the three triangles is equal to six rightangles of which the sum of the six angles ABC BCA ACD CDA ADB and DBA is greater than two rightangles Thus the sum of the remaining three angles BAC CAD and DAB containing the solid angle is less than four rightangles Thus any solid angle is contained by plane angles whose sum is less than four rightangles Which is the very thing it was required to show This proposition is only proved for the case of a solid angle contained by three plane angles However the generalization to a solid angle contained by more than three plane angles is straightforward kb Proposition 22 If there are three plane angles of which the sum of any two is greater than the remaining one the an gles being taken up in any possible way and if equal straightlines contain them then it is possible to construct a triangle from the straightlines created by joining the ends of the equal straightlines L K A Z E H J G D B G K A E D B L C F H Let ABC DEF and GHK be three plane angles of which the sum of any two is greater than the remain ing one the angles being taken up in any possible waythat is ABC and DEF greater than GHK DEF and GHK greater than ABC and further GHK and ABC greater than DEF And let AB BC DE EF GH and HK be equal straightlines And let AC DF and GK have been joined I say that that it is possi ble to construct a triangle out of straightlines equal to AC DF and GKthat is to say that the sum of any two of AC DF and GK is greater than the remaining one Now if the angles ABC DEF and GHK are equal to one another then it is clear that with AC DF and GK also becoming equal it is possible to construct a triangle from straightlines equal to AC DF and GK And if not let them be unequal and let KHL equal to angle ABC have been constructed on the straightline HK at the point H on it And let HL be made equal to 445STOIQEIWN ia ELEMENTS BOOK 11 one of AB BC DE EF GH and HK And let KL and GL have been joined And since the two straight lines AB and BC are equal to the two straightlines KH and HL respectively and the angle at B is equal to KHL the base AC is thus equal to the base KL Prop 14 And since the sum of ABC and GHK is greater than DEF and ABC equal to KHL GHL is thus greater than DEF And since the two straight lines GH and HL are equal to the two straightlines DE and EF respectively and angle GHL is greater than DEF the base GL is thus greater than the base DF Prop 124 But the sum of GK and KL is greater than GL Prop 120 Thus the sum of GK and KL is much greater than DF And KL is equal to AC Thus the sum of AC and GK is greater than the remaining straightline DF So similarly we can show that the sum of AC and DF is greater than GK and further that the sum of DF and GK is greater than AC Thus it is possible to construct a triangle from straightlines equal to AC DF and GK Which is the very thing it was required to show kg Proposition 23 To construct a solid angle from three given plane angles the sum of two of which is greater than the re maining one the angles being taken up in any possible way So it is necessary for the sum of the three an gles to be less than four rightangles Prop 1121 B K A Z E H J G D G K A E D B C F H Let ABC DEF and GHK be the three given plane angles of which let the sum of two be greater than the remaining one the angles being taken up in any pos sible way and further let the sum of the three be less than four rightangles So it is necessary to construct a solid angle from plane angles equal to ABC DEF and GHK Let AB BC DE EF GH and HK be cut off so as to be equal to one another And let AC DF and GK have been joined It is thus possible to construct a triangle from straightlines equal to AC DF and GK Prop 1122 Let such a triangle LMN have be con structed such that AC is equal to LM DF to MN and further GK to NL And let the circle LMN have been circumscribed about triangle LMN Prop 45 And let 446STOIQEIWN ia ELEMENTS BOOK 11 its center have been found and let it be at O And let LO MO and NO have been joined P M R X N L O R M N L Q P O I say that AB is greater than LO For if not AB is either equal to or less than LO Let it rst of all be equal And since AB is equal to LO but AB is equal to BC and OL to OM so the two straightlines AB and BC are equal to the two straightlines LO and OM re spectively And the base AC was assumed to be equal to the base LM Thus angle ABC is equal to angle LOM Prop 18 So for the same reasons DEF is also equal to MON and further GHK to NOL Thus the three angles ABC DEF and GHK are equal to the three angles LOM MON and NOL respectively But the sum of the three angles LOM MON and NOL is equal to four rightangles Thus the sum of the three angles ABC DEF and GHK is also equal to four right angles And it was also assumed to be less than four rightangles The very thing is absurd Thus AB is not equal to LO So I say that AB is not less than LO either For if possible let it be less And let OP be made equal to AB and OQ equal to BC and let PQ have been joined And since AB is equal to BC OP is also equal to OQ Hence the remainder LP is also equal to the remainder QM LM is thus parallel to PQ Prop 62 and triangle LMO is equiangular with triangle PQO Prop 129 Thus as OL is to LM so OP is to PQ Prop 64 Alternately as LO is to OP so LM is to PQ Prop 516 And LO is greater than OP Thus LM is also greater than PQ Prop 514 But LM was made equal to AC Thus AC is also greater than PQ Therefore since the two straightlines AB and BC are equal to the two straightlines PO and OQ respectively and the base AC is greater than the base PQ the angle ABC is thus greater than the angle POQ Prop 125 So similarly we can show that DEF is also greater than MON and GHK than NOL Thus the sum of the three angles ABC DEF and GHK is greater than the sum of the three angles LOM MON 447STOIQEIWN ia ELEMENTS BOOK 11 and NOL But the sum of ABC DEF and GHK was assumed to be less than four rightangles Thus the sum of LOM MON and NOL is much less than four rightangles But it is also equal to four rightangles The very thing is absurd Thus AB is not less than LO And it was shown to be not equal either Thus AB is greater than LO So let OR have been set up at point O at right angles to the plane of circle LMN Prop 1112 And let the square on OR be equal to that area by which the square on AB is greater than the square on LO Prop 1123 lem And let RL RM and RN have been joined And since RO is at rightangles to the plane of cir cle LMN RO is thus also at rightangles to each of LO MO and NO And since LO is equal to OM and OR is common and at rightangles the base RL is thus equal to the base RM Prop 14 So for the same reasons RN is also equal to each of RL and RM Thus the three straightlines RL RM and RN are equal to one an other And since the square on OR was assumed to be equal to that area by which the square on AB is greater than the square on LO the square on AB is thus equal to the sum of the squares on LO and OR And the square on LR is equal to the sum of the squares on LO and OR For LOR is a rightangle Prop 147 Thus the square on AB is equal to the square on RL Thus AB is equal to RL But each of BC DE EF GH and HK is equal to AB and each of RM and RN equal to RL Thus each of AB BC DE EF GH and HK is equal to each of RL RM and RN And since the two straightlines LR and RM are equal to the two straightlines AB and BC respec tively and the base LM was assumed to be equal to the base AC the angle LRM is thus equal to the angle ABC Prop 18 So for the same reasons MRN is also equal to DEF and LRN to GHK Thus the solid angle R contained by the angles LRM MRN and LRN has been constructed out of the three plane angles LRM MRN and LRN which are equal to the three given plane angles ABC DEF and GHK respectively Which is the very thing it was required to do 448STOIQEIWN ia ELEMENTS BOOK 11 A B G A B C Lmma Lemma And we can demonstrate thusly in which manner to take the square on OR equal to that area by which the square on AB is greater than the square on LO Let the straightlines AB and LO be set out and let AB be greater and let the semicircle ABC have been drawn around it And let AC equal to the straightline LO which is not greater than the diameter AB have been inserted into the semicircle ABC Prop 41 And let CB have been joined Therefore since the angle ACB is in the semicircle ACB ACB is thus a rightangle Prop 331 Thus the square on AB is equal to the sum of the squares on AC and CB Prop 147 Hence the square on AB is greater than the square on AC by the square on CB And AC is equal to LO Thus the square on AB is greater than the square on LO by the square on CB Therefore if we take OR equal to BC then the square on AB will be greater than the square on LO by the square on OR Which is the very thing it was prescribed to do kd Proposition 24 If a solid gure is contained by six parallel planes then its opposite planes are both equal and parallelo grammic G E H D A Z J B H E A B F C G D For let the solid gure CDHG have been contained by the parallel planes AC GF and AH DF and BF AE I say that its opposite planes are both equal and parallelogrammic For since the two parallel planes BG and CE are cut by the plane AC their common sections are parallel Prop 1116 Thus AB is parallel to DC Again since the two parallel planes BF and AE are cut by the plane 449STOIQEIWN ia ELEMENTS BOOK 11 AC their common sections are parallel Prop 1116 Thus BC is parallel to AD And AB was also shown to be parallel to DC Thus AC is a parallelogram So sim ilarly we can also show that DF FG GB BF and AE are each parallelograms Let AH and DF have been joined And since AB is parallel to DC and BH to CF so the two straightlines joining one another AB and BH are parallel to the two straightlines joining one another DC and CF respec tively not being in the same plane Thus they will contain equal angles Prop 1110 Thus angle ABH is equal to angle DCF And since the two straight lines AB and BH are equal to the two straightlines DC and CF respectively Prop 134 and angle ABH is equal to angle DCF the base AH is thus equal to the base DF and triangle ABH is equal to triangle DCF Prop 14 And parallelogram BG is double triangle ABH and parallelogram CE double triangle DCF Prop 134 Thus parallelogram BG is equal to paral lelogram CE So similarly we can show that AC is also equal to GF and AE to BF Thus if a solid gure is contained by six parallel planes then its opposite planes are both equal and paral lelogrammic Which is the very thing it was required to show ke Proposition 25 If a parallelipiped solid is cut by a plane which is par allel to the opposite planes of the parallelipiped then as the base is to the base so the solid will be to the solid Y R U D W T H I K A E N P F O Z G J S M Q L X B R U D T I K A E N M L X O H Y Q G V F C S W P B For let the parallelipiped solid ABCD have been cut by the plane FG which is parallel to the opposite planes RA and DH I say that as the base AEFV is to the base EHCF so the solid ABFU is to the solid EGCD For let AH have been produced in each direction And let any number whatsoever of lengths AK and KL be made equal to AE and any number whatsoever of lengths HM and MN equal to EH And let the paral lelograms LP KV HW and MS have been completed 450STOIQEIWN ia ELEMENTS BOOK 11 and the solids LQ KR DM and MT And since the straightlines LK KA and AE are equal to one another the parallelograms LP KV and AF are also equal to one another and KO KB and AG are equal to one another and further LX KQ and AR are equal to one another For they are opposite Prop 1124 So for the same reasons the parallelo grams EC HW and MS are also equal to one another and HG HI and IN are equal to one another and further DH MY and NT are equal to one another Thus three planes of one of the solids LQ KR and AU are equal to the corresponding three planes of the others But the three planes in one of the soilds are equal to the three opposite planes Prop 1124 Thus the three solids LQ KR and AU are equal to one an other Def 1110 So for the same reasons the three solids ED DM and MT are also equal to one another Thus as many multiples as the base LF is of the base AF so many multiples is the solid LU also of the the solid AU So for the same reasons as many multiples as the base NF is of the base FH so many multiples is the solid NU also of the solid HU And if the base LF is equal to the base NF then the solid LU is also equal to the solid NU And if the base LF exceeds the base NF then the solid LU also exceeds the solid NU And if LF is less than NF then LU is also less than NU So there are four magnitudes the two bases AF and FH and the two solids AU and UH and equal multiples have been taken of the base AF and the solid AU namely the base LF and the solid LUand of the base HF and the solid HUnamely the base NF and the solid NU And it has been shown that if the base LF exceeds the base FN then the solid LU also exceeds the solid NU and if LF is equal to FN then LU is equal to NU and if LF is less than FN then LU is less than NU Thus as the base AF is to the base FH so the solid AU is to the solid UH Def 55 Which is the very thing it was required to show Here Euclid assumes that LF NF implies LU NU This is easily demonstrated k Proposition 26 To construct a solid angle equal to a given solid angle on a given straightline and at a given point on it Let AB be the given straightline and A the given point on it and D the given solid angle contained by the plane angles EDC EDF and FDC So it is necessary to construct a solid angle equal to the solid angle D on the straightline AB and at the point A on it 451STOIQEIWN ia ELEMENTS BOOK 11 H D G B A K Z L E J B A K L E H F C G D For let some random point F have been taken on DF and let FG have been drawn from F perpendicular to the plane through ED and DC Prop 1111 and let it meet the plane at G and let DG have been joined And let BAL equal to the angle EDC and BAK equal to EDG have been constructed on the straightline AB at the point A on it Prop 123 And let AK be made equal to DG And let KH have been set up at the point K at rightangles to the plane through BAL Prop 1112 And let KH be made equal to GF And let HA have been joined I say that the solid angle at A contained by the plane angles BAL BAH and HAL is equal to the solid angle at D contained by the plane angles EDC EDF and FDC For let AB and DE have been cut off so as to be equal and let HB KB FE and GE have been joined And since FG is at rightangles to the reference plane EDC it will also make rightangles with all of the straightlines joined to it which are also in the reference plane Def 113 Thus the angles FGD and FGE are rightangles So for the same reasons the an gles HKA and HKB are also rightangles And since the two straightlines KA and AB are equal to the two straightlines GD and DE respectively and they con tain equal angles the base KB is thus equal to the base GE Prop 14 And KH is also equal to GF And they contain rightangles with the respective bases Thus HB is also equal to FE Prop 14 Again since the two straightlines AK and KH are equal to the two straightlines DG and GF respectively and they con tain rightangles the base AH is thus equal to the base FD Prop 14 And AB is also equal to DE So the two straightlines HA and AB are equal to the two straightlines DF and DE respectively And the base HB is equal to the base FE Thus the angle BAH is equal to the angle EDF Prop 18 So for the same reasons HAL is also equal to FDC And BAL is also equal to EDC Thus a solid angle has been constructed equal to the given solid angle at D on the given straightline AB 452STOIQEIWN ia ELEMENTS BOOK 11 at the given point A on it Which is the very thing it was required to do kz Proposition 27 To describe a parallelepiped solid similar and simi larly laid out to a given parallelepiped solid on a given straightline Let the given straightline be AB and the given par allelepiped solid CD So it is necessary to describe a parallelepiped solid similar and similarly laid out to the given parallelepiped solid CD on the given straightline AB For let a solid angle contained by the plane angles BAH HAK and KAB have been constructed equal to solid angle at C on the straightline AB at the point A on it Prop 1126 such that angle BAH is equal to ECF and BAK to ECG and KAH to GCF And let it have been contrived that as EC is to CG so BA is to AK and as GC is to CF so KA is to AH Prop 612 And thus via equality as EC is to CF so BA is to AH Prop 522 And let the parallelogram HB have been completed and the solid AL K E G A B D L H M Z J K E A B D L M F C H G And since as EC is to CG so BA is to AK and the sides about the equal angles ECG and BAK are thus proportional the parallelogram GE is thus simi lar to the parallelogram KB So for the same reasons the parallelogram KH is also similar to the parallelogram GF and further FE is similar to HB Thus three of the parallelograms of solid CD are similar to three of the parallelograms of solid AL But the former three are equal and similar to the three opposite and the lat ter three are equal and similar to the three opposite Thus the whole solid CD is similar to the whole solid AL Def 119 Thus AL similar and similarly laid out to the given parallelepiped solid CD has been described on the given straightlines AB Which is the very thing it was re quired to do kh Proposition 28 If a parallelepiped solid is cut by a plane passing 453STOIQEIWN ia ELEMENTS BOOK 11 through the diagonals of a pair of opposite planes then the solid will be cut in half by the plane Z B E G D A J H B E D A H F G C For let the parallelepiped solid AB have been cut by the plane CDEF passing through the diagonals of the opposite planes CF and DE I say that the solid AB will be cut in half by the plane CDEF For since triangle CGF is equal to triangle CFB and ADE is equal to DEH Prop 134 and parallelo gram CA is also equal to EBfor they are opposite Prop 1124and GE equal to CH thus the prism contained by the two triangles CGF and ADE and the three parallelograms GE AC and CE is also equal to the prism contained by the two triangles CFB and DEH and the three parallelograms CH BE and CE For they are contained by planes which are equal in number and in magnitude Def 1110 Thus the whole of solid AB is cut in half by the plane CDEF Which is the very thing it was required to show Here it is assumed that the two diagonals lie in the same plane The proof is easily supplied However strictly speaking the prisms are not similarly arranged being mirror images of one another kj Proposition 29 Parallelepiped solids which are on the same base and have the same height and in which the ends of the straightlines standing up are on the same straightlines are equal to one another Z E H G A L M N J E D B K E A L M N D B G F C H For let the parallelepiped solids CM and CN be on 454STOIQEIWN ia ELEMENTS BOOK 11 the same base AB and have the same height and let the ends of the straightlines standing up in them AG AF LM LN CD CE BH and BK be on the same straightlines FN and DK I say that solid CM is equal to solid CN For since CH and CK are each parallelograms CB is equal to each of DH and EK Prop 134 Hence DH is also equal to EK Let EH have been subtracted from both Thus the remainder DE is equal to the re mainder HK Hence triangle DCE is also equal to tri angle HBK Props 14 18 and parallelogram DG to parallelogram HN Prop 136 So for the same rea sons traingle AFG is also equal to triangle MLN And parallelogram CF is also equal to parallelogram BM and CG to BN Prop 1124 For they are opposite Thus the prism contained by the two triangles AFG and DCE and the three parallelograms AD DG and CG is equal to the prism contained by the two triangles MLN and HBK and the three parallelograms BM HN and BN Let the solid whose base is parallelogram AB and whose opposite face is GEHM have been added to both prisms Thus the whole parallelepiped solid CM is equal to the whole parallelepiped solid CN Thus parallelepiped solids which are on the same base and have the same height and in which the ends of the straightlines standing up are on the same straightlines are equal to one another Which is the very thing it was required to show l Proposition 30 Parallelepiped solids which are on the same base and have the same height and in which the ends of the straightlines standing up are not on the same straight lines are equal to one another L A G Z O K R B N M X E H J D P O A K R B N M E G P F C H D L Q Let the parallelepiped solids CM and CN be on the same base AB and have the same height and let the ends of the straightlines standing up in them AF AG 455STOIQEIWN ia ELEMENTS BOOK 11 LM LN CD CE BH and BK not be on the same straightlines I say that the solid CM is equal to the solid CN For let NK and DH have been produced and let them have joined one another at R And further let FM and GE have been produced to P and Q respectively And let AO LP CQ and BR have been joined So solid CM whose base is parallelogram ACBL and oppo site face FDHM is equal to solid CP whose base is parallelogram ACBL and opposite face OQRP For they are on the same base ACBL and have the same height and the ends of the straightlines standing up in them AF AO LM LP CD CQ BH and BR are on the same straightlines FP and DR Prop 1129 But solid CP whose base is parallelogram ACBL and oppo site face OQRP is equal to solid CN whose base is parallelogram ACBL and opposite face GEKN For again they are on the same base ACBL and have the same height and the ends of the straightlines standing up in them AG AO CE CQ LN LP BK and BR are on the same straightlines GQ and NR Prop 1129 Hence solid CM is also equal to solid CN Thus parallelepiped solids which are on the same base and have the same height and in which the ends of the straightlines standing up are not on the same straightlines are equal to one another Which is the very thing it was required to show la Proposition 31 Parallelepiped solids which are on equal bases and have the same height are equal to one another Let the parallelepiped solids AE and CF be on the equal bases AB and CD respectively and have the same height I say that solid AE is equal to solid CF So let the straightlines standing up HK BE AG LM PQ DF CO and RS rst of all be at rightangles to the bases AB and CD And let RT have been produced in a straightline with CR And let angle T RU equal to angle ALB have been constructed on the straightline RT at the point R on it Prop 123 And let RT be made equal to AL and RU to LB And let the base RW and the solid XU have been completed 456STOIQEIWN ia ELEMENTS BOOK 11 H Z I G W Q R T K E H L A B J U o a M O D F X S Y M I S R T K E L A B F C O D a Y U b W H G Q c d e X V P And since the two straightlines T R and RU are equal to the two straightlines AL and LB respec tively and they contain equal angles parallelogram RW is thus equal and similar to parallelogram HL Prop 614 And again since AL is equal to RT and LM to RS and they contain rightangles paral lelogram RX is thus equal and similar to parallelogram AM Prop 614 So for the same reasons LE is also equal and similar to SU Thus three parallelograms of solid AE are equal and similar to three parallelograms of solid XU But the three faces of the former solid are equal and similar to the three opposite faces and the three faces of the latter solid to the three opposite faces Prop 1124 Thus the whole parallelepiped solid AE is equal to the whole parallelepiped solid XU Def 1110 Let DR and WU have been drawn across and let them have met one another at Y And let aT b have been drawn through T parallel to DY And let PD have been produced to a And let the solids Y X and RI have been completed So solid XY whose base is parallelogram RX and opposite face Y c is equal to solid XU whose base is parallelogram RX and oppo site face UV For they are on the same base RX and have the same height and the ends of the straight lines standing up in them RY RU T b T W Se Sd Xc and XV are on the same straightlines Y W and eV Prop 1129 But solid XU is equal to AE Thus 457STOIQEIWN ia ELEMENTS BOOK 11 solid XY is also equal to solid AE And since parallel ogram RUWT is equal to parallelogram Y T For they are on the same base RT and between the same par allels RT and Y W Prop 135 But RUWT is equal to CD since it is also equal to AB Parallelogram Y T is thus also equal to CD And DT is another par allelogram Thus as base CD is to DT so Y T is to DT Prop 57 And since the parallelepiped solid CI has been cut by the plane RF which is parallel to the opposite planes of CI as base CD is to base DT so solid CF is to solid RI Prop 1125 So for the same reasons since the parallelepiped solid Y I has been cut by the plane RX which is parallel to the opposite planes of Y I as base Y T is to base T D so solid Y X is to solid RI Prop 1125 But as base CD is to DT so Y T is to DT And thus as solid CF is to solid RI so solid Y X is to solid RI Thus solids CF and Y X each have the same ratio to RI Prop 511 Thus solid CF is equal to solid Y X Prop 59 But Y X was show to be equal to AE Thus AE is also equal to CF N K E L B W I R U Q D A H J P X G Z T M O Y S F X K E L B I R U D A O F C H G W Q T Y V N M P S And so let the straightlines standing up AG HK BE LM CO PQ DF and RS not be at rightangles to the bases AB and CD Again I say that solid AE is equal to solid CF For let KN ET GU MV QW FX OY and SI have been drawn from points K E G M Q F O and S respectively perpendicular to the reference plane ie the plane of the bases AB and CD and let them have met the plane at points N T U V W X Y and I respectively And let NT NU UV T V WX WY Y I and IX have been joined So solid KV is equal to solid QI For they are on the equal bases KM and QS and have the same height and the straightlines standing up in them are at rightangles to their bases see rst part of proposition But solid KV is equal to solid AE and QI to CF For they are on the same base and have the same height and the straightlines standing up in them are not on the same straightlines Prop 1130 Thus solid AE is also equal to solid CF Thus parallelepiped solids which are on equal bases 458STOIQEIWN ia ELEMENTS BOOK 11 and have the same height are equal to one another Which is the very thing it was required to show lb Proposition 32 Parallelepiped solids which have the same height are to one another as their bases L A E B G H J D Z K L B A E D K F C H G Let AB and CD be parallelepiped solids having the same height I say that the parallelepiped solids AB and CD are to one another as their bases That is to say as base AE is to base CF so solid AB is to solid CD For let FH equal to AE have been applied to FG in the angle FGH equal to angle LCG Prop 145 And let the parallelepiped solid GK having the same height as CD have been completed on the base FH So solid AB is equal to solid GK For they are on the equal bases AE and FH and have the same height Prop 1131 And since the parallelepiped solid CK has been cut by the plane DG which is parallel to the opposite planes of CK thus as the base CF is to the base FH so the solid CD is to the solid DH Prop 1125 And base FH is equal to base AE and solid GK to solid AB And thus as base AE is to base CF so solid AB is to solid CD Thus parallelepiped solids which have the same height are to one another as their bases Which is the very thing it was required to show lg Proposition 33 Similar parallelepiped solids are to one another as the cubed ratio of their corresponding sides Let AB and CD be similar parallelepiped solids and let AE correspond to CF I say that solid AB has to solid CD the cubed ratio that AE has to CF For let EK EL and EM have been produced in a straightline with AE GE and HE respectively And let EK be made equal to CF and EL equal to FN and further EM equal to FR And let the parallelogram KL have been completed and the solid KP 459STOIQEIWN ia ELEMENTS BOOK 11 D G Z N R D N R C F And since the two straightlines KE and EL are equal to the two straightlines CF and FN but angle KEL is also equal to angle CFN inasmuch as AEG is also equal to CFN on account of the similarity of the solids AB and CD parallelogram KL is thus equal and similar to parallelogram CN So for the same reasons parallelogram KM is also equal and similar to parallel ogram CR and further EP to DF Thus three par allelograms of solid KP are equal and similar to three parallelograms of solid CD But the three former par allelograms are equal and similar to the three opposite parallelograms and the three latter parallelograms are equal and similar to the three opposite parallelo grams Prop 1124 Thus the whole of solid KP is equal and similar to the whole of solid CD Def 1110 Let parallelogram GK have been completed And let the the solids EO and LQ with bases the parallelograms GK and KL respectively and with the same height as AB have been completed And since on account of the sim ilarity of solids AB and CD as AE is to CF so EG is to FN and EH to FR Defs 61 119 and CF is equal to EK and FN to EL and FR to EM thus as AE is to EK so GE is to EL and HE to EM But as AE is to EK so parallelogram AG is to paral lelogram GK and as GE is to EL so GK is to KL and as HE is to EM so QE is to KM Prop 61 And thus as parallelogram AG is to GK so GK is to KL and QE is to KM But as AG is to GK so solid AB is to solid EO and as GK is to KL so solid OE is to solid QL and as QE is to KM so solid QL is to solid KP Prop 1132 And thus as solid AB is to EO so EO is to QL and QL to KP And if four magnitudes are continuously proportional then the rst has to the fourth the cubed ratio that it has to the sec ond Def 510 Thus solid AB has to KP the cubed ratio which AB has to EO But as AB is to EO so parallelogram AG is to GK and the straightline AE to EK Prop 61 Hence solid AB also has to KP the cubed ratio that AE has to EK And solid KP is 460STOIQEIWN ia ELEMENTS BOOK 11 equal to solid CD and straightline EK to CF Thus solid AB also has to solid CD the cubed ratio which its corresponding side AE has to the corresponding side CF P A H X M L J B O K E Q A M L B E O P G K H Thus similar parallelepiped solids are to one another as the cubed ratio of their corresponding sides Which is the very thing it was required to show Pri sma Corollary So it is clear from this that if four straightlines are continuously proportional then as the rst is to the fourth so the parallelepiped solid on the rst will be to the similar and similarly described parallelepiped solid on the second since the rst also has to the fourth the cubed ratio that it has to the second ld Proposition 34 The bases of equal parallelepiped solids are recip rocally proportional to their heights And those paral lelepiped solids whose bases are reciprocally proportional to their heights are equal Let AB and CD be equal parallelepiped solids I say that the bases of the parallelepiped solids AB and CD are reciprocally proportional to their heights and so as base EH is to base NQ so the height of solid CD is to the height of solid AB For rst of all let the straightlines standing up AG EF LB HK CM NO PD and QR be at right angles to their bases I say that as base EH is to base NQ so CM is to AG Therefore if base EH is equal to base NQ and solid AB is also equal to solid CD CM will also be equal to AG For parallelepiped solids of the same height are to one another as their bases Prop 1132 And as base 461STOIQEIWN ia ELEMENTS BOOK 11 EH is to NQ so CM will be to AG And so it is clear that the bases of the parallelepiped solids AB and CD are reciprocally proportional to their heights P K Z B D M R A E J G N O F T H X L O K B D M R A E N T F P V C H G L Q So let base EH not be equal to base NQ but let EH be greater And solid AB is also equal to solid CD Thus CM is also greater than AG Therefore let CT be made equal to AG And let the parallelepiped solid V C have been completed on the base NQ with height CT And since solid AB is equal to solid CD and CV is extrinsic to them and equal magnitudes have the same ratio to the same magnitude Prop 57 thus as solid AB is to solid CV so solid CD is to solid CV But as solid AB is to solid CV so base EH is to base NQ For the solids AB and CV are of equal height Prop 1132 And as solid CD is to solid CV so base MQ is to base T Q Prop 1125 and CM to CT Prop 61 And thus as base EH is to base NQ so MC is to AG And CT is equal to AG And thus as base EH is to base NQ so MC is to AG Thus the bases of the parallelepiped solids AB and CD are reciprocally proportional to their heights So again let the bases of the parallelepipid solids AB and CD be reciprocally proportional to their heights and let base EH be to base NQ as the height of solid CD is to the height of solid AB I say that solid AB is equal to solid CD For let the straightlines standing up again be at rightangles to the bases And if base EH is equal to base NQ and as base EH is to base NQ so the height of solid CD is to the height of solid AB the height of solid CD is thus also equal to the height of solid AB And parallelepiped solids on equal bases and also with the same height are equal to one another Prop 1131 Thus solid AB is equal to solid CD So let base EH not be equal to base NQ but let EH be greater Thus the height of solid CD is also greater than the height of solid AB that is to say CM greater than AG Let CT again be made equal to AG and let the solid CV have been similarly completed Since as base EH is to base NQ so MC is to AG 462STOIQEIWN ia ELEMENTS BOOK 11 and AG is equal to CT thus as base EH is to base NQ so CM is to CT But as base EH is to base NQ so solid AB is to solid CV For solids AB and CV are of equal heights Prop 1132 And as CM is to CT so is base MQ to base QT Prop 61 and solid CD to solid CV Prop 1125 And thus as solid AB is to solid CV so solid CD is to solid CV Thus AB and CD each have the same ratio to CV Thus solid AB is equal to solid CD Prop 59 Z A H K B E R P N X L S G M Y X J U O W D F T F A K B E R N L S M H G Q C a U D Y P O V W T X So let the straightlines standing up FE BL GA KH ON DP MC and RQ not be at rightangles to their bases And let perpendiculars have been drawn to the planes through EH and NQ from points F G B K O M R and D and let them have joined the planes at points S T U V W X Y and a respectively And let the solids FV and OY have been completed In this case also I say that the solids AB and CD being equal their bases are reciprocally proportional to their heights and so as base EH is to base NQ so the height of solid CD is to the height of solid AB Since solid AB is equal to solid CD but AB is equal to BT For they are on the same base FK and have the same height Props 1129 1130 And solid CD is equal is equal to DX For again they are on the same base RO and have the same height Props 1129 1130 Solid BT is thus also equal to solid DX Thus as base FK is to base OR so the height of solid DX is to the height of solid BT see rst part of proposition And base FK is equal to base EH and base OR to NQ Thus as base EH is to base NQ so the height of solid DX is to 463STOIQEIWN ia ELEMENTS BOOK 11 the height of solid BT And solids DX BT are the same height as solids DC BA respectively Thus as base EH is to base NQ so the height of solid DC is to the height of solid AB Thus the bases of the parallelepiped solids AB and CD are reciprocally proportional to their heights So again let the bases of the parallelepiped solids AB and CD be reciprocally proportional to their heights and so let base EH be to base NQ as the height of solid CD is to the height of solid AB I say that solid AB is equal to solid CD For with the same construction as before since as base EH is to base NQ so the height of solid CD is to the height of solid AB and base EH is equal to base FK and NQ to OR thus as base FK is to base OR so the height of solid CD is to the height of solid AB And solids AB CD are the same height as solids BT DX respectively Thus as base FK is to base OR so the height of solid DX is to the height of solid BT Thus the bases of the parallelepiped solids BT and DX are reciprocally proportional to their heights Thus solid BT is equal to solid DX see rst part of proposition But BT is equal to BA For they are on the same base FK and have the same height Props 1129 1130 And solid DX is equal to solid DC Props 1129 1130 Thus solid AB is also equal to solid CD Which is the very thing it was required to show This proposition assumes that a if two parallelepipeds are equal and have equal bases then their heights are equal and b if the bases of two equal parallelepipeds are unequal then that solid which has the lesser base has the greater height le Proposition 35 If there are two equal plane angles and raised straightlines are stood on the apexes of them containing equal angles respectively with the original straightlines forming the angles and random points are taken on the raised straightlines and perpendiculars are drawn from them to the planes in which the original angles are and straightlines are joined from the points created in the planes to the vertices of the original angles then they will enclose equal angles with the raised straight lines Let BAC and EDF be two equal rectilinear angles And let the raised straightlines AG and DM have been stood on points A and D containing equal angles respec tively with the original straightlines That is MDE equal to GAB and MDF to GAC And let the ran dom points G and M have been taken on AG and DM respectively And let the GL and MN have been drawn from points G and M perpendicular to the planes through 464STOIQEIWN ia ELEMENTS BOOK 11 BAC and EDF respectively And let them have joined the planes at points L and N respectively And let LA and ND have been joined I say that angle GAL is equal to angle MDN N D M G A Z L E B J H K N D M A L E C F B H G K Let AH be made equal to DM And let HK have been drawn through point H parallel to GL And GL is per pendicular to the plane through BAC Thus HK is also perpendicular to the plane through BAC Prop 118 And let KC NF KB and NE have been drawn from points K and N perpendicular to the straightlines AC DF AB and DE And let HC CB MF and FE have been joined Since the square on HA is equal to the sum of the squares on HK and KA Prop 147 and the sum of the squares on KC and CA is equal to the square on KA Prop 147 thus the square on HA is equal to the sum of the squares on HK KC and CA And the square on HC is equal to the sum of the squares on HK and KC Prop 147 Thus the square on HA is equal to the sum of the squares on HC and CA Thus angle HCA is a rightangle Prop 148 So for the same reasons angle DFM is also a rightangle Thus angle ACH is equal to an gle DFM And HAC is also equal to MDF So MDF and HAC are two triangles having two angles equal to two angles respectively and one side equal to one side namely that subtending one of the equal angles that is HA equal to MD Thus they will also have the re maining sides equal to the remaining sides respectively Prop 126 Thus AC is equal to DF So similarly we can show that AB is also equal to DE Therefore since AC is equal to DF and AB to DE so the two straight lines CA and AB are equal to the two straightlines FD and DE respectively But angle CAB is also equal to angle FDE Thus base BC is equal to base EF and triangle ACB to triangle DFE and the remaining angles to the remaining angles respectively Prop 14 465STOIQEIWN ia ELEMENTS BOOK 11 Thus angle ACB is equal to DFE And the rightangle ACK is also equal to the rightangle DFN Thus the remainder BCK is equal to the remainder EFN So for the same reasons CBK is also equal to FEN So BCK and EFN are two triangles having two an gles equal to two angles respectively and one side equal to one sidenamely that by the equal anglesthat is BC equal to EF Thus they will also have the re maining sides equal to the remaining sides respectively Prop 126 Thus CK is equal to FN And AC is also equal to DF So the two straightlines AC and CK are equal to the two straightlines DF and FN respec tively And they enclose rightangles Thus base AK is equal to base DN Prop 14 And since AH is equal to DM the square on AH is also equal to the square on DM But the the sum of the squares on AK and KH is equal to the square on AH For angle AKH is a rightangle Prop 147 And the sum of the squares on DN and NM is equal to the square on DM For an gle DNM is a rightangle Prop 147 Thus the sum of the squares on AK and KH is equal to the sum of the squares on DN and NM of which the square on AK is equal to the square on DN Thus the remaining square on KH is equal to the square on NM Thus HK is equal to MN And since the two straightlines HA and AK are equal to the two straightlines MD and DN respectively and base HK was shown to be equal to base MN angle HAK is thus equal to angle MDN Prop 18 Thus if there are two equal plane angles and so on of the proposition Which is the very thing it was re quired to show Pri sma Corollary So it is clear from this that if there are two equal plane angles and equal raised straightlines are stood on them at their apexes containing equal angles re spectively with the original straightlines forming the angles then the perpendiculars drawn from the raised ends of them to the planes in which the original angles lie are equal to one another Which is the very thing it was required to show l Proposition 36 If three straightlines are continuously proportional then the parallelepiped solid formed from the three straightlines is equal to the equilateral parallelepiped solid on the middle straightline which is equiangular to the aforementioned parallelepiped solid 466STOIQEIWN ia ELEMENTS BOOK 11 L M N B A E D X G H J Z K L M N B A H O F E C D G K Let A B and C be three continuously proportional straightlines such that as A is to B so B is to C I say that the parallelepiped solid formed from A B and C is equal to the equilateral solid on B which is equiangular with the aforementioned solid Let the solid angle at E contained by DEG GEF and FED be set out And let DE GE and EF each be made equal to B And let the parallelepiped solid EK have been completed And let LM be made equal to A And let the solid angle contained by NLO OLM and MLN have been constructed on the straight line LM and at the point L on it so as to be equal to the solid angle E Prop 1123 And let LO be made equal to B and LN equal to C And since as A is to B so B is to C and A is equal to LM and B to each of LO and ED and C to LN thus as LM is to EF so DE is to LN And so the sides around the equal angles NLM and DEF are reciprocally pro portional Thus parallelogram MN is equal to parallel ogram DF Prop 614 And since the two plane recti linear angles DEF and NLM are equal and the raised straightlines stood on them at their apexes LO and EG are equal to one another and contain equal angles respectively with the original straightlines forming the angles the perpendiculars drawn from points G and O to the planes through NLM and DEF respectively are thus equal to one another Prop 1135 corr Thus the solids LH and EK have the same height And paral lelepiped solids on equal bases and with the same height are equal to one another Prop 1131 Thus solid HL is equal to solid EK And LH is the solid formed from A B and C and EK the solid on B Thus the par allelepiped solid formed from A B and C is equal to the equilateral solid on B which is equiangular with the aforementioned solid Which is the very thing it was required to show lz Proposition 37 If four straightlines are proportional then the similar 467STOIQEIWN ia ELEMENTS BOOK 11 and similarly described parallelepiped solids on them will also be proportional And if the similar and similarly described parallelepiped solids on them are proportional then the straightlines themselves will be proportional J E Z M A K L G D B H N C E M A K L D B N F G H Let AB CD EF and GH be four proportional straightlines such that as AB is to CD so EF is to GH And let the similar and similarly laid out par allelepiped solids KA LC ME and NG have been de scribed on AB CD EF and GH respectively I say that as KA is to LC so ME is to NG For since the parallelepiped solid KA is similar to LC KA thus has to LC the cubed ratio that AB has to CD Prop 1133 So for the same reasons ME also has to NG the cubed ratio that EF has to GH Prop 1133 And since as AB is to CD so EF is to GH thus also as AK is to LC so ME is to NG And so let solid AK be to solid LC as solid ME is to NG I say that as straightline AB is to CD so EF is to GH For again since KA has to LC the cubed ratio that AB has to CD Prop 1133 and ME also has to NG the cubed ratio that EF has to GH Prop 1133 and as KA is to LC so ME is to NG thus also as AB is to CD so EF is to GH Thus if four straightlines are proportional and so on of the proposition Which is the very thing it was required to show This proposition assumes that if two ratios are equal then the cube of the former is also equal to the cube of the latter and vice versa lh Proposition 38 If the sides of the opposite planes of a cube are cut in half and planes are produced through the pieces then the common section of the latter planes and the diam eter of the cube cut one another in half 468STOIQEIWN ia ELEMENTS BOOK 11 J D Z O X G H N M T U L E S R P A K B H D N T U L E S R A C F G K O P Q M B For let the opposite planes CF and AH of the cube AF have been cut in half at the points K L M N O Q P and R And let the planes KN and OR have been produced through the pieces And let US be the common section of the planes and DG the diameter of cube AF I say that UT is equal to T S and DT to T G For let DU UE BS and SG have been joined And since DO is parallel to PE the alternate angles DOU and UPE are equal to one another Prop 129 And since DO is equal to PE and OU to UP and they contain equal angles base DU is thus equal to base UE and tri angle DOU is equal to triangle PUE and the remaining angles are equal to the remaining angles Prop 14 Thus angle OUD is equal to angle PUE So for this reason DUE is a straightline Prop 114 So for the same reason BSG is also a straightline and BS equal to SG And since CA is equal and parallel to DB but CA is also equal and parallel to EG DB is thus also equal and parallel to EG Prop 119 And the straight lines DE and BG join them DE is thus parallel to BG Prop 133 Thus angle EDT is equal to BGT For they are alternate Prop 129 And angle DT U is equal to GT S Prop 115 So DT U and GT S are two triangles having two angles equal to two angles and one side equal to one sidenamely that subtended by one of the equal anglesthat is DU equal to GS For they are halves of DE and BG respectively Thus they will also have the remaining sides equal to the re maining sides Prop 126 Thus DT is equal to T G and UT to T S Thus if the sides of the opposite planes of a cube are cut in half and planes are produced through the pieces then the common section of the latter planes and the diameter of the cube cut one another in half Which is the very thing it was required to show 469STOIQEIWN ia ELEMENTS BOOK 11 lj Proposition 39 If there are two equal height prisms and one has a parallelogram and the other a triangle as a base and the parallelogram is double the triangle then the prisms will be equal N K E B D G H O M L J X Z A A K E B D M L C G P H N O F Let ABCDEF and GHKLMN be two equal height prisms and let the former have the parallelogram AF and the latter the triangle GHK as a base And let par allelogram AF be twice triangle GHK I say that prism ABCDEF is equal to prism GHKLMN For let the solids AO and GP have been com pleted Since parallelogram AF is double triangle GHK and parallelogram HK is also double triangle GHK Prop 134 parallelogram AF is thus equal to paral lelogram HK And parallelepiped solids which are on equal bases and have the same height are equal to one another Prop 1131 Thus solid AO is equal to solid GP And prism ABCDEF is half of solid AO and prism GHKLMN half of solid GP Prop 1128 Prism ABCDEF is thus equal to prism GHKLMN Thus if there are two equal height prisms and one has a parallelogram and the other a triangle as a base and the parallelogram is double the triangle then the prisms are equal Which is the very thing it was re quired to show 470ELEMENTS BOOK 12 Proportional Stereometry The novel feature of this book is the use of the socalled method of exhaustion see Prop 101 a precursor to integration which is generally attributed to Eudoxus of Cnidus 471STOIQEIWN ib ELEMENTS BOOK 12 a Proposition 1 Similar polygons inscribed in circles are to one an other as the squares on the diameters of the circles N M E B A Z H K L G J D D M E B A K L N C H G F Let ABC and FGH be circles and let ABCDE and FGHKL be similar polygons inscribed in them re spectively and let BM and GN be the diameters of the circles respectively I say that as the square on BM is to the square on GN so polygon ABCDE is to polygon FGHKL For let BE AM GL and FN have been joined And since polygon ABCDE is similar to polygon FGHKL angle BAE is also equal to angle GFL and as BA is to AE so GF is to FL Def 61 So BAE and GFL are two triangles having one angle equal to one angle namely BAE equal to GFL and the sides around the equal angles proportional Triangle ABE is thus equiangular with triangle FGL Prop 66 Thus angle AEB is equal to angle FLG But AEB is equal to AMB and FLG to FNG for they stand on the same circumference Prop 327 Thus AMB is also equal to FNG And the rightangle BAM is also equal to the rightangle GFN Prop 331 Thus the remaining an gle is also equal to the remaining angle Prop 132 Thus triangle ABM is equiangular with triangle FGN Thus proportionally as BM is to GN so BA is to GF Prop 64 But the ratio of the square on BM to the square on GN is the square of the ratio of BM to GN and the ratio of polygon ABCDE to polygon FGHKL is the square of the ratio of BA to GF Prop 620 And thus as the square on BM is to the square on GN so polygon ABCDE is to polygon FGHKL Thus similar polygons inscribed in circles are to one another as the squares on the diameters of the circles Which is the very thing it was required to show b Proposition 2 Circles are to one another as the squares on their diameters Let ABCD and EFGH be circles and let BD and 472STOIQEIWN ib ELEMENTS BOOK 12 FH be their diameters I say that as circle ABCD is to circle EFGH so the square on BD is to the square on FH M J K E X R D P S T B Z N G O A L H M K E R D S T B N A L C F G H O P Q For if the circle ABCD is not to the circle EFGH as the square on BD is to the square on FH then as the square on BD is to the square on FH so circle ABCD will be to some area either less than or greater than circle EFGH Let it rst of all be in that ratio to some lesser area S And let the square EFGH have been inscribed in circle EFGH Prop 46 So the in scribed square is greater than half of circle EFGH inas much as if we draw tangents to the circle through the points E F G and H then square EFGH is half of the square circumscribed about the circle Prop 147 and the circle is less than the circumscribed square Hence the inscribed square EFGH is greater than half of cir cle EFGH Let the circumferences EF FG GH and HE have been cut in half at points K L M and N respectively and let EK KF FL LG GM MH HN and NE have been joined And thus each of the triangles EKF FLG GMH and HNE is greater than half of the segment of the circle about it inasmuch as if we draw tangents to the circle through points K L M and N and complete the parallelograms on the straightlines EF FG GH and HE then each of the triangles EKF FLG GMH and HNE will be half of the parallelogram about it but the segment about it is less than the parallelogram Hence each of the tri angles EKF FLG GMH and HNE is greater than half of the segment of the circle about it So by cutting the circumferences remaining behind in half and joining straightlines and doing this continually we will even 473STOIQEIWN ib ELEMENTS BOOK 12 tually leave behind some segments of the circle whose sum will be less than the excess by which circle EFGH exceeds the area S For we showed in the rst theo rem of the tenth book that if two unequal magnitudes are laid out and if a part greater than a half is sub tracted from the greater and if from the remainder a part greater than a half is subtracted and this hap pens continually then some magnitude will eventually be left which will be less than the lesser laid out mag nitude Prop 101 Therefore let the segments have been left and let the sum of the segments of the circle EFGH on EK KF FL LG GM MH HN and NE be less than the excess by which circle EFGH exceeds area S Thus the remaining polygon EKFLGMHN is greater than area S And let the polygon AOBPCQDR similar to the polygon EKFLGMHN have been in scribed in circle ABCD Thus as the square on BD is to the square on FH so polygon AOBPCQDR is to polygon EKFLGMHN Prop 121 But also as the square on BD is to the square on FH so circle ABCD is to area S And thus as circle ABCD is to area S so polygon AOBPGQDR is to polygon EKFLGMHN Prop 511 Thus alternately as circle ABCD is to the polygon inscribed within it so area S is to poly gon EKFLGMHN Prop 516 And circle ABCD is greater than the polygon inscribed within it Thus area S is also greater than polygon EKFLGMHN But it is also less The very thing is impossible Thus the square on BD is not to the square on FH as circle ABCD is to some area less than circle EFGH So similarly we can show that the square on FH is not to the square on BD as circle EFGH is to some area less than circle ABCD either So I say that neither is the square on BD to the square on FH as circle ABCD is to some area greater than circle EFGH For if possible let it be in that ratio to some greater area S Thus inversely as the square on FH is to the square on DB so area S is to circle ABCD Prop 57 corr But as area S is to circle ABCD so circle EFGH is to some area less than circle ABCD see lemma And thus as the square on FH is to the square on BD so circle EFGH is to some area less than circle ABCD Prop 511 The very thing was shown to be impossible Thus as the square on BD is to the square on FH so circle ABCD is not to some area greater than circle EFGH And it was shown that neither is it in that ratio to some lesser area Thus as the square on BD is to the square on FH so circle ABCD is to circle EFGH Thus circles are to one another as the squares on 474STOIQEIWN ib ELEMENTS BOOK 12 their diameters Which is the very thing it was re quired to show Lmma Lemma So I say that area S being greater than circle EFGH as area S is to circle ABCD so circle EFGH is to some area less than circle ABCD For let it have been contrived that as area S is to circle ABCD so circle EFGH is to area T I say that area T is less than circle ABCD For since as area S is to circle ABCD so circle EFGH is to area T alter nately as area S is to circle EFGH so circle ABCD is to area T Prop 516 And area S is greater than circle EFGH Thus circle ABCD is also greater than area T Prop 514 Hence as area S is to circle ABCD so circle EFGH is to some area less than circle ABCD Which is the very thing it was required to show g Proposition 3 Any pyramid having a triangular base is divided into two pyramids having triangular bases which are equal similar to one another and similar to the whole and into two equal prisms And the sum of the two prisms is greater than half of the whole pyramid D B Z G H L E J A K B L F G H C E A K D Let there be a pyramid whose base is triangle ABC and whose apex is point D I say that pyramid ABCD is divided into two pyramids having triangular bases which are equal to one another and similar to the whole and into two equal prisms And the sum of the two prisms is greater than half of the whole pyramid For let AB BC CA AD DB and DC have been cut in half at points E F G H K and L respectively And let HE EG GH HK KL LH KF and FG have been joined Since AE is equal to EB and AH to DH 475STOIQEIWN ib ELEMENTS BOOK 12 EH is thus parallel to DB Prop 62 So for the same reasons HK is also parallel to AB Thus HEBK is a parallelogram Thus HK is equal to EB Prop 134 But EB is equal to EA Thus AE is also equal to HK And AH is also equal to HD So the two straightlines EA and AH are equal to the two straightlines KH and HD respectively And angle EAH is equal to an gle KHD Prop 129 Thus base EH is equal to base KD Prop 14 Thus triangle AEH is equal and simi lar to triangle HKD Prop 14 So for the same rea sons triangle AHG is also equal and similar to trian gle HLD And since EH and HG are two straightlines joining one another which are respectively parallel to two straightlines joining one another KD and DL not being in the same plane they will contain equal angles Prop 1110 Thus angle EHG is equal to angle KDL And since the two straightlines EH and HG are equal to the two straightlines KD and DL respectively and angle EHG is equal to angle KDL base EG is thus equal to base KL Prop 14 Thus triangle EHG is equal and similar to triangle KDL So for the same rea sons triangle AEG is also equal and similar to triangle HKL Thus the pyramid whose base is triangle AEG and apex the point H is equal and similar to the pyra mid whose base is triangle HKL and apex the point D Def 1110 And since HK has been drawn parallel to one of the sides AB of triangle ADB triangle ADB is equiangular to triangle DHK Prop 129 and they have proportional sides Thus triangle ADB is similar to triangle DHK Def 61 So for the same reasons tri angle DBC is also similar to triangle DKL and ADC to DLH And since two straightlines joining one another BA and AC are parallel to two straightlines joining one another KH and HL not in the same plane they will contain equal angles Prop 1110 Thus angle BAC is equal to angle KHL And as BA is to AC so KH is to HL Thus triangle ABC is similar to triangle HKL Prop 66 And thus the pyramid whose base is trian gle ABC and apex the point D is similar to the pyra mid whose base is triangle HKL and apex the point D Def 119 But the pyramid whose base is triangle HKL and apex the point D was shown to be similar to the pyramid whose base is triangle AEG and apex the point H Thus each of the pyramids AEGH and HKLD is similar to the whole pyramid ABCD And since BF is equal to FC parallelogram EBFG is double triangle GFC Prop 141 And since if two prisms have equal heights and the former has a par allelogram as a base and the latter a triangle and the parallelogram is double the triangle then the prisms are equal Prop 1139 the prism contained by the two 476STOIQEIWN ib ELEMENTS BOOK 12 triangles BKF and EHG and the three parallelograms EBFG EBKH and HKFG is thus equal to the prism contained by the two triangles GFC and HKL and the three parallelograms KFCL LCGH and HKFG And it is clear that each of the prisms whose base is parallelogram EBFG and opposite side straightline HK and whose base is triangle GFC and opposite plane triangle HKL is greater than each of the pyra mids whose bases are triangles AEG and HKL and apexes the points H and D respectively inasmuch as if we also join the straightlines EF and EK then the prism whose base is parallelogram EBFG and oppo site side straightline HK is greater than the pyramid whose base is triangle EBF and apex the point K But the pyramid whose base is triangle EBF and apex the point K is equal to the pyramid whose base is triangle AEG and apex point H For they are contained by equal and similar planes And hence the prism whose base is parallelogram EBFG and opposite side straight line HK is greater than the pyramid whose base is triangle AEG and apex the point H And the prism whose base is parallelogram EBFG and opposite side straightline HK is equal to the prism whose base is triangle GFC and opposite plane triangle HKL And the pyramid whose base is triangle AEG and apex the point H is equal to the pyramid whose base is trian gle HKL and apex the point D Thus the sum of the aforementioned two prisms is greater than the sum of the aforementioned two pyramids whose bases are tri angles AEG and HKL and apexes the points H and D respectively Thus the whole pyramid whose base is triangle ABC and apex the point D has been divided into two pyramids which are equal to one another and similar to the whole and into two equal prisms And the sum of the two prisms is greater than half of the whole pyra mid Which is the very thing it was required to show d Proposition 4 If there are two pyramids with the same height hav ing trianglular bases and each of them is divided into two pyramids equal to one another and similar to the whole and into two equal prisms then as the base of one pyra mid is to the base of the other pyramid so the sum of all the prisms in one pyramid will be to the sum of all the equal number of prisms in the other pyramid Let there be two pyramids with the same height hav ing the triangular bases ABC and DEF with apexes the points G and H respectively And let each of them have been divided into two pyramids equal to one an 477STOIQEIWN ib ELEMENTS BOOK 12 other and similar to the whole and into two equal prisms Prop 123 I say that as base ABC is to base DEF so the sum of all the prisms in pyramid ABCG is to the sum of all the equal number of prisms in pyramid DEFH N A G M L J Z E T O X H R F D S P U B K K A M L E T R D S U B C F G H O P Q V N For since BO is equal to OC and AL to LC LO is thus parallel to AB and triangle ABC similar to triangle LOC Prop 123 So for the same reasons triangle DEF is also similar to triangle RV F And since BC is double CO and EF double FV thus as BC is to CO so EF is to FV And the similar and similarly laid out rectilinear gures ABC and LOC have been described on BC and CO respectively and the sim ilar and similarly laid out rectilinear gures DEF and RV F on EF and FV respectively Thus as tri angle ABC is to triangle LOC so triangle DEF is to triangle RV F Prop 622 Thus alternately as trian gle ABC is to triangle DEF so triangle LOC is to triangle RV F Prop 516 But as triangle LOC is to triangle RV F so the prism whose base is trian gle LOC and opposite plane PMN is to the prism whose base is triangle RV F and opposite plane ST U see lemma And thus as triangle ABC is to trian gle DEF so the prism whose base is triangle LOC and opposite plane PMN is to the prism whose base is triangle RV F and opposite plane ST U And as the aforementioned prisms are to one another so the prism whose base is parallelogram KBOL and oppo site side straightline PM is to the prism whose base is parallelogram QEV R and opposite side straight line ST Props 1139 123 Thus also is the sum of the two prismsthat whose base is parallelogram KBOL and opposite side PM and that whose base is LOC and opposite plane PMNto the sum of the two prismsthat whose base is QEV R and op posite side straightline ST and that whose base is triangle RV F and opposite plane ST U Prop 512 And thus as base ABC is to base DEF so the sum 478STOIQEIWN ib ELEMENTS BOOK 12 of the rst aforementioned two prisms is to the sum of the second aforementioned two prisms And similarly if pyramids PMNG and ST UH are di vided into two prisms and two pyramids as base PMN is to base ST U so the sum of the two prisms in pyra mid PMNG will be to the sum of the two prisms in pyramid ST UH But as base PMN is to base ST U so base ABC is to base DEF For the triangles PMN and ST U are equal to LOC and RV F respectively And thus as base ABC is to base DEF so the sum of the four prisms is to the sum of the four prisms Prop 512 So similarly even if we divide the pyra mids left behind into two pyramids and into two prisms as base ABC is to base DEF so the sum of all the prisms in pyramid ABCG will be to the sum of all the equal number of prisms in pyramid DEFH Which is the very thing it was required to show Lmma Lemma And one may show as follows that as triangle LOC is to triangle RV F so the prism whose base is trian gle LOC and opposite plane PMN is to the prism whose base is triangle RV F and opposite plane ST U For in the same gure let perpendiculars have been conceived drawn from points G and H to the planes ABC and DEF respectively These clearly turn out to be equal on account of the pyramids being assumed to be of equal height And since two straightlines GC and the perpendicular from G are cut by the parallel planes ABC and PMN they will be cut in the same ra tios Prop 1117 And GC was cut in half by the plane PMN at N Thus the perpendicular from G to the plane ABC will also be cut in half by the plane PMN So for the same reasons the perpendicular from H to the plane DEF will also be cut in half by the plane ST U And the perpendiculars from G and H to the planes ABC and DEF respectively are equal Thus the perpendiculars from the triangles PMN and ST U to ABC and DEF respectively are also equal Thus the prisms whose bases are triangles LOC and RV F and opposite sides PMN and ST U respectively are of equal height And hence the parallelepiped solids described on the aforementioned prisms are of equal height and are to one another as their bases Prop 1132 Likewise the halves of the solids Prop 1128 Thus as base LOC is to base RV F so the aforementioned prisms are to one another Which is the very thing it was required to show 479STOIQEIWN ib ELEMENTS BOOK 12 e Proposition 5 Pyramids which are of the same height and have tri angular bases are to one another as their bases Q A M L E T R F D S U B N G Z P O H J X K W A M L E T R D S Q U B C F G H O P V N K Let there be pyramids of the same height whose bases are the triangles ABC and DEF and apexes the points G and H respectively I say that as base ABC is to base DEF so pyramid ABCG is to pyramid DEFH For if base ABC is not to base DEF as pyramid ABCG is to pyramid DEFH then base ABC will be to base DEF as pyramid ABCG is to some solid ei ther less than or greater than pyramid DEFH Let it rst of all be in this ratio to some lesser solid W And let pyramid DEFH have been divided into two pyra mids equal to one another and similar to the whole and into two equal prisms So the sum of the two prisms is greater than half of the whole pyramid Prop 123 And again let the pyramids generated by the division have been similarly divided and let this be done contin ually until some pyramids are left from pyramid DEFH which when added together are less than the excess by which pyramid DEFH exceeds the solid W Prop 101 Let them have been left and for the sake of argument let them be DQRS and ST UH Thus the sum of the remaining prisms within pyramid DEFH is greater than solid W Let pyramid ABCG also have been divided sim ilarly and a similar number of times as pyramid DEFH Thus as base ABC is to base DEF so the sum of the prisms within pyramid ABCG is to the sum of the prisms within pyramid DEFH Prop 124 But also as base ABC is to base DEF so pyramid ABCG is to solid W And thus as pyramid ABCG is to solid W so the sum of the prisms within pyramid ABCG is to the sum of the prisms within pyramid DEFH Prop 511 Thus alternately as pyramid ABCG is to the sum of the prisms within it so solid W is to the sum of the prisms within pyramid DEFH Prop 516 And pyramid ABCG is greater than the sum of the prisms within it Thus solid W is also greater than the sum of the prisms within pyramid DEFH Prop 514 But it is also less This very thing is impossible Thus as base ABC is to base DEF so pyramid ABCG is 480STOIQEIWN ib ELEMENTS BOOK 12 not to some solid less than pyramid DEFH So simi larly we can show that base DEF is not to base ABC as pyramid DEFH is to some solid less than pyramid ABCG either So I say that neither is base ABC to base DEF as pyramid ABCG is to some solid greater than pyramid DEFH For if possible let it be in this ratio to some greater solid W Thus inversely as base DEF is to base ABC so solid W is to pyramid ABCG Prop 57 corr And as solid W is to pyramid ABCG so pyramid DEFH is to some solid less than pyramid ABCG as shown before Prop 122 lem And thus as base DEF is to base ABC so pyramid DEFH is to some solid less than pyramid ABCG Prop 511 The very thing was shown to be absurd Thus base ABC is not to base DEF as pyramid ABCG is to some solid greater than pyramid DEFH And it was shown that neither is it in this ratio to a lesser solid Thus as base ABC is to base DEF so pyramid ABCG is to pyramid DEFH Which is the very thing it was required to show Proposition 6 Pyramids which are of the same height and have polygonal bases are to one another as their bases J M D B K N A L E G H Z L M D B K N A E H G F C Let there be pyramids of the same height whose bases are the polygons ABCDE and FGHKL and apexes the points M and N respectively I say that as base ABCDE is to base FGHKL so pyramid ABCDEM is to pyramid FGHKLN For let AC AD FH and FK have been joined Therefore since ABCM and ACDM are two pyramids having triangular bases and equal height they are to one another as their bases Prop 125 Thus as base ABC is to base ACD so pyramid ABCM is to pyra mid ACDM And via composition as base ABCD 481STOIQEIWN ib ELEMENTS BOOK 12 is to base ACD so pyramid ABCDM is to pyra mid ACDM Prop 518 But as base ACD is to base ADE so pyramid ACDM is also to pyramid ADEM Prop 125 Thus via equality as base ABCD is to base ADE so pyramid ABCDM is to pyramid ADEM Prop 522 And again via composition as base ABCDE is to base ADE so pyramid ABCDEM is to pyramid ADEM Prop 518 So similarly it can also be shown that as base FGHKL is to base FGH so pyramid FGHKLN is also to pyramid FGHN And since ADEM and FGHN are two pyramids having tri angular bases and equal height thus as base ADE is to base FGH so pyramid ADEM is to pyramid FGHN Prop 125 But as base ADE is to base ABCDE so pyramid ADEM was to pyramid ABCDEM Thus via equality as base ABCDE is to base FGH so pyramid ABCDEM is also to pyramid FGHN Prop 522 But furthermore as base FGH is to base FGHKL so pyramid FGHN was also to pyramid FGHKLN Thus via equality as base ABCDE is to base FGHKL so pyramid ABCDEM is also to pyramid FGHKLN Prop 522 Which is the very thing it was required to show z Proposition 7 Any prism having a triangular base is divided into three pyramids having triangular bases which are equal to one another G B A E Z D C B A E D F Let there be a prism whose base is triangle ABC and opposite plane DEF I say that prism ABCDEF is divided into three pyramids having triangular bases which are equal to one another For let BD EC and CD have been joined Since ABED is a parallelogram and BD is its diagonal tri angle ABD is thus equal to triangle EBD Prop 134 482STOIQEIWN ib ELEMENTS BOOK 12 And thus the pyramid whose base is triangle ABD and apex the point C is equal to the pyramid whose base is triangle DEB and apex the point C Prop 125 But the pyramid whose base is triangle DEB and apex the point C is the same as the pyramid whose base is trian gle EBC and apex the point D For they are contained by the same planes And thus the pyramid whose base is ABD and apex the point C is equal to the pyramid whose base is EBC and apex the point D Again since FCBE is a parallelogram and CE is its diagonal trian gle CEF is equal to triangle CBE Prop 134 And thus the pyramid whose base is triangle BCE and apex the point D is equal to the pyramid whose base is trian gle ECF and apex the point D Prop 125 And the pyramid whose base is triangle BCE and apex the point D was shown to be equal to the pyramid whose base is triangle ABD and apex the point C Thus the pyramid whose base is triangle CEF and apex the point D is also equal to the pyramid whose base is triangle ABD and apex the point C Thus the prism ABCDEF has been divided into three pyramids having triangular bases which are equal to one another And since the pyramid whose base is triangle ABD and apex the point C is the same as the pyramid whose base is triangle CAB and apex the point D For they are contained by the same planes And the pyramid whose base is triangle ABD and apex the point C was shown to be a third of the prism whose base is triangle ABC and opposite plane DEF thus the pyramid whose base is triangle ABC and apex the point D is also a third of the pyramid having the same base triangle ABC and opposite plane DEF Pri sma Corollary And from this it is clear that any pyramid is the third part of the prism having the same base as it and an equal height Which is the very thing it was required to show h Proposition 8 Similar pyramids which also have triangular bases are in the cubed ratio of their corresponding sides Let there be similar and similarly laid out pyramids whose bases are triangles ABC and DEF and apexes the points G and H respectively I say that pyramid ABCG has to pyramid DEFH the cubed ratio of that BC has to EF 483STOIQEIWN ib ELEMENTS BOOK 12 M Z K H N X O L B G A P E D J R M K N L B E R C O P F D Q H G A For let the parallelepiped solids BGML and EHQP have been completed And since pyramid ABCG is simi lar to pyramid DEFH angle ABC is thus equal to angle DEF and GBC to HEF and ABG to DEH And as AB is to DE so BC is to EF and BG to EH Def 119 And since as AB is to DE so BC is to EF and so the sides around equal angles are proportional parallel ogram BM is thus similar to paralleleogram EQ So for the same reasons BN is also similar to ER and BK to EO Thus the three parallelograms MB BK and BN are similar to the three parallelograms EQ EO ER respectively But the three parallelograms MB BK and BN are both equal and similar to the three opposite parallelograms and the three parallel ograms EQ EO and ER are both equal and simi lar to the three opposite parallelograms Prop 1124 Thus the solids BGML and EHQP are contained by equal numbers of similar and similarly laid out planes Thus solid BGML is similar to solid EHQP Def 119 And similar parallelepiped solids are in the cubed ratio of corresponding sides Prop 1133 Thus solid BGML has to solid EHQP the cubed ratio that the correspond ing side BC has to the corresponding side EF And as solid BGML is to solid EHQP so pyramid ABCG is to pyramid DEFH inasmuch as the pyramid is the sixth part of the solid on account of the prism being half of the parallelepiped solid Prop 1128 also being three times the pyramid Prop 127 Thus pyramid ABCG also has to pyramid DEFH the cubed ratio that BC has to EF Which is the very thing it was required to show Pri sma Corollary So from this it is also clear that similar pyra mids having polygonal bases are to one another as the cubed ratio of their corresponding sides For dividing them into the pyramids contained within them which have triangular bases with the similar polygons of the bases also being divided into similar triangles which are 484STOIQEIWN ib ELEMENTS BOOK 12 both equal in number and corresponding to the wholes Prop 620 As one pyramid having a triangular base in the former pyramid having a polygonal base is to one pyramid having a triangular base in the latter pyramid having a polygonal base so the sum of all the pyra mids having triangular bases in the former pyramid will also be to the sum of all the pyramids having triangu lar bases in the latter pyramid Prop 512that is to say the former pyramid itself having a polygonal base to the latter pyramid having a polygonal base And a pyramid having a triangular base is to a pyramid hav ing a triangular base in the cubed ratio of corresponding sides Prop 128 Thus a pyramid having a polygonal base also has to to a pyramid having a similar base the cubed ratio of a corresponding side to a correspond ing side j Proposition 9 The bases of equal pyramids which also have trian gular bases are reciprocally proportional to their heights And those pyramids which have triangular bases whose bases are reciprocally proportional to their heights are equal L X R O P B G J E D Z H M A L R B E D M A H O P Q F C G For let there be two equal pyramids having the tri angular bases ABC and DEF and apexes the points G and H respectively I say that the bases of the pyramids ABCG and DEFH are reciprocally proportional to their heights and so that as base ABC is to base DEF so the height of pyramid DEFH is to the height of pyra mid ABCG For let the parallelepiped solids BGML and EHQP have been completed And since pyramid ABCG is equal to pyramid DEFH and solid BGML is six times pyramid ABCG see previous proposition and solid EHQP is six times pyramid DEFH solid BGML is 485STOIQEIWN ib ELEMENTS BOOK 12 thus equal to solid EHQP And the bases of equal par allelepiped solids are reciprocally proportional to their heights Prop 1134 Thus as base BM is to base EQ so the height of solid EHQP is to the height of solid BGML But as base BM is to base EQ so triangle ABC is to triangle DEF Prop 134 And thus as triangle ABC is to triangle DEF so the height of solid EHQP is to the height of solid BGML Prop 511 But the height of solid EHQP is the same as the height of pyramid DEFH and the height of solid BGML is the same as the height of pyramid ABCG Thus as base ABC is to base DEF so the height of pyramid DEFH is to the height of pyramid ABCG Thus the bases of pyramids ABCG and DEFH are reciprocally propor tional to their heights And so let the bases of pyramids ABCG and DEFH be reciprocally proportional to their heights and thus let base ABC be to base DEF as the height of pyramid DEFH is to the height of pyramid ABCG I say that pyramid ABCG is equal to pyramid DEFH For with the same construction since as base ABC is to base DEF so the height of pyramid DEFH is to the height of pyramid ABCG but as base ABC is to base DEF so parallelogram BM is to parallelogram EQ Prop 134 thus as parallelogram BM is to paral lelogram EQ so the height of pyramid DEFH is also to the height of pyramid ABCG Prop 511 But the height of pyramid DEFH is the same as the height of parallelepiped EHQP and the height of pyramid ABCG is the same as the height of parallelepiped BGML Thus as base BM is to base EQ so the height of parallelepiped EHQP is to the height of parallelepiped BGML And those parallelepiped solids whose bases are reciprocally proportional to their heights are equal Prop 1134 Thus the parallelepiped solid BGML is equal to the par allelepiped solid EHQP And pyramid ABCG is a sixth part of BGML and pyramid DEFH a sixth part of par allelepiped EHQP Thus pyramid ABCG is equal to pyramid DEFH Thus the bases of equal pyramids which also have triangular bases are reciprocally proportional to their heights And those pyramids having triangular bases whose bases are reciprocally proportional to their heights are equal Which is the very thing it was required to show i Proposition 10 Every cone is the third part of the cylinder which has the same base as it and an equal height For let there be a cone with the same base as a cylin 486STOIQEIWN ib ELEMENTS BOOK 12 der namely the circle ABCD and an equal height I say that the cone is the third part of the cylinderthat is to say that the cylinder is three times the cone J B Z G H D A E C B D A E F G H For if the cylinder is not three times the cone then the cylinder will be either more than three times or less than three times the cone Let it rst of all be more than three times the cone And let the square ABCD have been inscribed in circle ABCD Prop 46 So square ABCD is more than half of circle ABCD Prop 122 And let a prism of equal height to the cylinder have been set up on square ABCD So the prism set up is more than half of the cylinder inasmuch as if we also circum scribe a square around circle ABCD Prop 47 then the square inscribed in circle ABCD is half of the circum scribed square And the solids set up on them are par allelepiped prisms of equal height And parallelepiped solids having the same height are to one another as their bases Prop 1132 And thus the prism set up on square ABCD is half of the prism set up on the square circumscribed about circle ABCD And the cylinder is less than the prism set up on the square circumscribed about circle ABCD Thus the prism set up on square ABCD of the same height as the cylinder is more than half of the cylinder Let the circumferences AB BC CD and DA have been cut in half at points E F G and H And let AE EB BF FC CG GD DH and HA have been joined And thus each of the triangles AEB BFC CGD and DHA is more than half of the segment of circle ABCD about it as was shown pre viously Prop 122 Let prisms of equal height to the cylinder have been set up on each of the triangles AEB BFC CGD and DHA And each of the prisms set up is greater than the half part of the segment of the cylinder about itinasmuch as if we draw straightlines parallel to AB BC CD and DA through points E F G and H 487STOIQEIWN ib ELEMENTS BOOK 12 respectively and complete the parallelograms on AB BC CD and DA and set up parallelepiped solids of equal height to the cylinder on them then the prisms on triangles AEB BFC CGD and DHA are each half of the set up parallelepipeds And the segments of the cylinder are less than the set up parallelepiped solids Hence the prisms on triangles AEB BFC CGD and DHA are also greater than half of the segments of the cylinder about them So if the remaining circumfer ences are cut in half and straightlines are joined and prisms of equal height to the cylinder are set up on each of the triangles and this is done continually then we will eventually leave some segments of the cylinder whose sum is less than the excess by which the cylinder ex ceeds three times the cone Prop 101 Let them have been left and let them be AE EB BF FC CG GD DH and HA Thus the remaining prism whose base is polygon AEBFCGDH and height the same as the cylinder is greater than three times the cone But the prism whose base is polygon AEBFCGDH and height the same as the cylinder is three times the pyramid whose base is polygon AEBFCGDH and apex the same as the cone Prop 127 corr And thus the pyramid whose base is polygon AEBFCGDH and apex the same as the cone is greater than the cone having as base circle ABCD But it is also less For it is encompassed by it The very thing is impossible Thus the cylinder is not more than three times the cone So I say that neither is the cylinder less than three times the cone For if possible let the cylinder be less than three times the cone Thus inversely the cone is greater than the third part of the cylinder So let the square ABCD have been inscribed in circle ABCD Prop 46 Thus square ABCD is greater than half of circle ABCD And let a pyramid having the same apex as the cone have been set up on square ABCD Thus the pyramid set up is greater than the half part of the cone inasmuch as we showed previously that if we circumscribe a square about the cir cle Prop 47 then the square ABCD will be half of the square circumscribed about the circle Prop 122 And if we set up on the squares parallelepiped solidswhich are also called prismsof the same height as the cone then the prism set up on square ABCD will be half of the prism set up on the square circumscribed about the circle For they are to one another as their bases Prop 1132 Hence the same also goes for the thirds Thus the pyramid whose base is square ABCD is half of the pyramid set up on the square circumscribed about the circle Prop 127 corr And the pyramid set up on the square circumscribed about the circle is greater 488STOIQEIWN ib ELEMENTS BOOK 12 than the cone For it encompasses it Thus the pyramid whose base is square ABCD and apex the same as the cone is greater than half of the cone Let the circum ferences AB BC CD and DA have been cut in half at points E F G and H respectively And let AE EB BF FC CG GD DH and HA have been joined And thus each of the triangles AEB BFC CGD and DHA is greater than the half part of the segment of cir cle ABCD about it Prop 122 And let pyramids having the same apex as the cone have been set up on each of the triangles AEB BFC CGD and DHA And thus in the same way each of the pyramids set up is more than the half part of the segment of the cone about it So if the remaining circumferences are cut in half and straight lines are joined and pyramids having the same apex as the cone are set up on each of the triangles and this is done continually then we will eventually leave some segments of the cone whose sum is less than the excess by which the cone exceeds the third part of the cylinder Prop 101 Let them have been left and let them be the segments on AE EB BF FC CG GD DH and HA Thus the remaining pyramid whose base is poly gon AEBFCGDH and apex the same as the cone is greater than the third part of the cylinder But the pyra mid whose base is polygon AEBFCGDH and apex the same as the cone is the third part of the prism whose base is polygon AEBFCGDH and height the same as the cylinder Prop 127 corr Thus the prism whose base is polygon AEBFCGDH and height the same as the cylinder is greater than the cylinder whose base is circle ABCD But it is also less For it is encompassed by it The very thing is impossible Thus the cylinder is not less than three times the cone And it was shown that neither is it greater than three times the cone Thus the cylinder is three times the cone Hence the cone is the third part of the cylinder Thus every cone is the third part of the cylinder which has the same base as it and an equal height Which is the very thing it was required to show ia Proposition 11 Cones and cylinders having the same height are to one another as their bases Let there be cones and cylinders of the same height whose bases are the circles ABCD and EFGH axes KL and MN and diameters of the bases AC and EG re spectively I say that as circle ABCD is to circle EFGH so cone AL is to cone EN 489STOIQEIWN ib ELEMENTS BOOK 12 R D T A U B L K M Z H N S J O Y X G E P F Q R D T A U B L K M N S E O P H F Q G C X V W For if not then as circle ABCD is to circle EFGH so cone AL will be to some solid either less than or greater than cone EN Let it rst of all be in this ra tio to some lesser solid O And let solid X be equal to that magnitude by which solid O is less than cone EN Thus cone EN is equal to the sum of solids O and X Let the square EFGH have been inscribed in cir cle EFGH Prop 46 Thus the square is greater than half of the circle Prop 122 Let a pyramid of the same height as the cone have been set up on square EFGH Thus the pyramid set up is greater than half of the cone inasmuch as if we circumscribe a square about the cir cle Prop 47 and set up on it a pyramid of the same height as the cone then the inscribed pyramid is half of the circumscribed pyramid For they are to one an other as their bases Prop 126 And the cone is less than the circumscribed pyramid Let the circumferences EF FG GH and HE have been cut in half at points P Q R and S And let HP PE EQ QF FR RG GS and SH have been joined Thus each of the trian gles HPE EQF FRG and GSH is greater than half of the segment of the circle about it Prop 122 Let pyramids of the same height as the cone have been set up on each of the triangles HPE EQF FRG and GSH And thus each of the pyramids set up is greater than half of the segment of the cone about it Prop 1210 So if the remaining circumferences are cut in half and straightlines are joined and pyramids of equal height to the cone are set up on each of the triangles and this is done continually then we will eventually leave some segments of the cone the sum of which is less than solid X Prop 101 Let them have been left and let them be the segments on HPE EQF FRG and GSH Thus the remaining pyramid whose base is poly gon HPEQFRGS and height the same as the cone is greater than solid O Prop 618 And let the polygon DT AUBV CW similar and similarly laid out to polygon HPEQFRGS have been inscribed in circle ABCD And on it let a pyramid of the same height as cone AL have been set up Therefore since as the square on AC is to the square on EG so polygon DT AUBV CW is to polygon HPEQFRGS Prop 121 and as the square on AC is to the square on EG so circle ABCD is 490STOIQEIWN ib ELEMENTS BOOK 12 to circle EFGH Prop 122 thus as circle ABCD is to circle EFGH so polygon DT AUBV CW also is to polygon HPEQFRGS And as circle ABCD is to cir cle EFGH so cone AL is to solid O And as poly gon DT AUBV CW is to polygon HPEQFRGS so the pyramid whose base is polygon DT AUBV CW and apex the point L is to the pyramid whose base is polygon HPEQFRGS and apex the point N Prop 126 And thus as cone AL is to solid O so the pyramid whose base is DT AUBV CW and apex the point L is to the pyramid whose base is polygon HPEQFRGS and apex the point N Prop 511 Thus alternately as cone AL is to the pyramid within it so solid O is to the pyramid within cone EN Prop 516 But cone AL is greater than the pyramid within it Thus solid O is also greater than the pyramid within cone EN Prop 514 But it is also less The very thing is absurd Thus circle ABCD is not to circle EFGH as cone AL is to some solid less than cone EN So similarly we can show that neither is circle EFGH to circle ABCD as cone EN is to some solid less than cone AL So I say that neither is circle ABCD to circle EFGH as cone AL is to some solid greater than cone EN For if possible let it be in this ratio to some greater solid O Thus inversely as circle EFGH is to circle ABCD so solid O is to cone AL Prop 57 corr But as solid O is to cone AL so cone EN is to some solid less than cone AL Prop 122 lem And thus as circle EFGH is to circle ABCD so cone EN is to some solid less than cone AL The very thing was shown to be impossible Thus circle ABCD is not to circle EFGH as cone AL is to some solid greater than cone EN And it was shown that neither is it in this ratio to some lesser solid Thus as circle ABCD is to circle EFGH so cone AL is to cone EN But as the cone is to the cone so the cylin der is to the cylinder For each is three times each Prop 1210 Thus circle ABCD is also to circle EFGH as the ratio of the cylinders on them having the same height Thus cones and cylinders having the same height are to one another as their bases Which is the very thing it was required to show ib Proposition 12 Similar cones and cylinders are to one another in the cubed ratio of the diameters of their bases Let there be similar cones and cylinders of which the bases are the circles ABCD and EFGH the diameters of the bases are BD and FH and the axes of the cones 491STOIQEIWN ib ELEMENTS BOOK 12 and cylinders are KL and MN respectively I say that the cone whose base is circle ABCD and apex the point L has to the cone whose base is circle EFGH and apex the point N the cubed ratio that BD has to FH J L B U G D Q K A T E S R H M N X F P O Z R L U D K A T E S M N C V W H G Q O F B P For if cone ABCDL does not have to cone EFGHN the cubed ratio that BD has to FH then cone ABCDL will have the cubed ratio to some solid either less than or greater than cone EFGHN Let it rst of all have such a ratio to some lesser solid O And let the square EFGH have been inscribed in circle EFGH Prop 46 Thus square EFGH is greater than half of circle EFGH Prop 122 And let a pyramid having the same apex as the cone have been set up on square EFGH Thus the pyramid set up is greater than the half part of the cone Prop 1210 So let the circumferences EF FG GH and HE have been cut in half at points P Q R and S respectively And let EP PF FQ QG GR RH HS and SE have been joined And thus each of the triangles EPF FQG GRH and HSE is greater than the half part of the segment of circle EFGH about it Prop 122 And let a pyramid having the same apex as the cone have been set up on each of the triangles EPF FQG GRH and HSE And thus each of the pyramids set up is greater than the half part of the segment of the cone about it Prop 1210 So if the the remaining cir cumferences are cut in half and straightlines are joined and pyramids having the same apex as the cone are set up on each of the triangles and this is done continu ally then we will eventually leave some segments of the cone whose sum is less than the excess by which cone EFGHN exceeds solid O Prop 101 Let them have been left and let them be the segments on EP PF FQ QG GR RH HS and SE Thus the remaining pyramid whose base is polygon EPFQGRHS and apex the point N is greater than solid O And let the polygon AT BUCV DW similar and similarly laid out to poly gon EPFQGRHS have been inscribed in circle ABCD Prop 618 And let a pyramid having the same apex as the cone have been set up on polygon AT BUCV DW 492STOIQEIWN ib ELEMENTS BOOK 12 And let LBT be one of the triangles containing the pyra mid whose base is polygon AT BUCV DW and apex the point L And let NFP be one of the triangles containing the pyramid whose base is triangle EPFQGRHS and apex the point N And let KT and MP have been joined And since cone ABCDL is similar to cone EFGHN thus as BD is to FH so axis KL is to axis MN Def 1124 And as BD is to FH so BK is to FM And thus as BK is to FM so KL is to MN And alternately as BK is to KL so FM is to MN Prop 516 And the sides around the equal angles BKL and FMN are proportional Thus triangle BKL is similar to triangle FMN Prop 66 Again since as BK is to KT so FM is to MP and they are about the equal angles BKT and FMP inasmuch as whatever part angle BKT is of the four rightangles at the center K angle FMP is also the same part of the four rightangles at the cen ter M Therefore since the sides about equal angles are proportional triangle BKT is thus similar to train gle FMP Prop 66 Again since it was shown that as BK is to KL so FM is to MN and BK is equal to KT and FM to PM thus as T K is to KL so PM is to MN And the sides about the equal angles T KL and PMNfor they are both rightanglesare proportional Thus triangle LKT is similar to triangle NMP Prop 66 And since on account of the similarity of triangles LKB and NMF as LB is to BK so NF is to FM and on account of the similarity of triangles BKT and FMP as KB is to BT so MF is to FP Def 61 thus via equality as LB is to BT so NF is to FP Prop 522 Again since on account of the similarity of triangles LT K and NPM as LT is to T K so NP is to PM and on account of the similarity of triangles T KB and PMF as KT is to T B so MP is to PF thus via equality as LT is to T B so NP is to PF Prop 522 And it was shown that as T B is to BL so PF is to FN Thus via equality as T L is to LB so PN is to NF Prop 522 Thus the sides of triangles LT B and NPF are proportional Thus tri angles LT B and NPF are equiangular Prop 65 And hence they are similar Def 61 And thus the pyra mid whose base is triangle BKT and apex the point L is similar to the pyramid whose base is triangle FMP and apex the point N For they are contained by equal numbers of similar planes Def 119 And similar pyra mids which also have triangular bases are in the cubed ratio of corresponding sides Prop 128 Thus pyramid BKT L has to pyramid FMPN the cubed ratio that BK has to FM So similarly joining straightlines from points A W D V C and U to center K and from points E S H R G and Q to center M and set 493STOIQEIWN ib ELEMENTS BOOK 12 ting up pyramids having the same apexes as the cones on each of the triangles so formed we can also show that each of the pyramids on base ABCD taken in or der will have to each of the pyramids on base EFGH taken in order the cubed ratio that the corresponding side BK has to the corresponding side FMthat is to say that BD has to FH And for two sets of propor tional magnitudes as one of the leading magnitudes is to one of the following so the sum of all of the leading magnitudes is to the sum of all of the following mag nitudes Prop 512 And thus as pyramid BKT L is to pyramid FMPN so the whole pyramid whose base is polygon AT BUCV DW and apex the point L is to the whole pyramid whose base is polygon EPFQGRHS and apex the point N And hence the pyramid whose base is polygon AT BUCV DW and apex the point L has to the pyramid whose base is polygon EPFQGRHS and apex the point N the cubed ratio that BD has to FH And it was also assumed that the cone whose base is circle ABCD and apex the point L has to solid O the cubed ratio that BD has to FH Thus as the cone whose base is circle ABCD and apex the point L is to solid O so the pyramid whose base is polygon AT BUCV DW and apex the point L is to the pyramid whose base is polygon EPFQGRHS and apex the point N Thus alternately as the cone whose base is circle ABCD and apex the point L is to the pyramid within it whose base is the polygon AT BUCV DW and apex the point L so the solid O is to the pyramid whose base is polygon EPFQGRHS and apex the point N Prop 516 And the aforementioned cone is greater than the pyramid within it For it encompasses it Thus solid O is also greater than the pyramid whose base is polygon EPFQGRHS and apex the point N But it is also less The very thing is impossible Thus the cone whose base is circle ABCD and apex the point L does not have to some solid less than the cone whose base is circle EFGH and apex the point N the cubed ratio that BD has to EH So similarly we can show that neither does cone EFGHN have to some solid less than cone ABCDL the cubed ratio that FH has to BD So I say that neither does cone ABCDL have to some solid greater than cone EFGHN the cubed ratio that BD has to FH For if possible let it have such a ratio to a greater solid O Thus inversely solid O has to cone ABCDL the cubed ratio that FH has to BD Prop 57 corr And as solid O is to cone ABCDL so cone EFGHN is to some solid less than cone ABCDL 122 lem Thus cone EFGHN also has to some solid less than cone ABCDL the cubed ratio that FH has to BD The very 494STOIQEIWN ib ELEMENTS BOOK 12 thing was shown to be impossible Thus cone ABCDL does not have to some solid greater than cone EFGHN the cubed ratio than BD has to FH And it was shown that neither does it have such a ratio to a lesser solid Thus cone ABCDL has to cone EFGHN the cubed ra tio that BD has to FG And as the cone is to the cone so the cylinder is to the cylinder For a cylinder is three times a cone on the same base as the cone and of the same height as it Prop 1210 Thus the cylinder also has to the cylinder the cubed ratio that BD has to FH Thus similar cones and cylinders are in the cubed ra tio of the diameters of their bases Which is the very thing it was required to show ig Proposition 13 If a cylinder is cut by a plane which is parallel to the opposite planes of the cylinder then as the cylinder is to the cylinder so the axis will be to the axis Q O R A H G T F L N E K Z X M P S B J D U F R A T L N E K M S B D U P G C V W Q H O For let the cylinder AD have been cut by the plane GH which is parallel to the opposite planes of the cylin der AB and CD And let the plane GH have met the axis at point K I say that as cylinder BG is to cylinder GD so axis EK is to axis KF For let axis EF have been produced in each direction to points L and M And let any number whatsoever of lengths EN and NL equal to axis EK be set out on the axis EL and any number whatsoever of lengths FO and OM equal to axis FK on the axis KM And let the cylinder PW whose bases are the circles PQ and V W have been conceived on axis LM And let planes parallel to AB CD and the bases of cylinder PW have been produced through points N and O and let them have made the circles RS and T U around the centers N and O respectively And since axes LN NE and EK are equal to one another the cylinders QR RB and BG are to one another as their bases Prop 1211 But the bases are equal Thus the cylinders QR RB and BG are also equal to one another Therefore since the axes LN NE and EK are equal to one another and the cylinders QR RB and BG are also equal to one another and the number of the former is equal to the number of the latter thus as many multiples as axis KL 495STOIQEIWN ib ELEMENTS BOOK 12 is of axis EK so many multiples is cylinder QG also of cylinder GB And so for the same reasons as many multiples as axis MK is of axis KF so many multiples is cylinder WG also of cylinder GD And if axis KL is equal to axis KM then cylinder QG will also be equal to cylinder GW and if the axis is greater than the axis then the cylinder will also be greater than the cylinder and if the axis is less then the cylinder will also be less So there are four magnitudesthe axes EK and KF and the cylinders BG and GDand equal multiples have been taken of axis EK and cylinder BGnamely axis LK and cylinder QGand of axis KF and cylinder GDnamely axis KM and cylinder GW And it has been shown that if axis KL exceeds axis KM then cylin der QG also exceeds cylinder GW and if the axes are equal then the cylinders are equal and if KL is less then QG is less Thus as axis EK is to axis KF so cylinder BG is to cylinder GD Def 55 Which is the very thing it was required to show id Proposition 14 Cones and cylinders which are on equal bases are to one another as their heights L E A B K D N M Z G J H L E A B K G H C D N M F For let EB and FD be cylinders on equal bases namely the circles AB and CD respectively I say that as cylinder EB is to cylinder FD so axis GH is to axis KL For let the axis KL have been produced to point N And let LN be made equal to axis GH And let the cylin der CM have been conceived about axis LN Therefore since cylinders EB and CM have the same height they are to one another as their bases Prop 1211 And the bases are equal to one another Thus cylinders EB and CM are also equal to one another And since cylinder FM has been cut by the plane CD which is parallel to its opposite planes thus as cylinder CM is to cylinder FD so axis LN is to axis KL Prop 1213 And cylin der CM is equal to cylinder EB and axis LN to axis GH Thus as cylinder EB is to cylinder FD so axis GH is 496STOIQEIWN ib ELEMENTS BOOK 12 to axis KL And as cylinder EB is to cylinder FD so cone ABG is to cone CDK Prop 1210 Thus also as axis GH is to axis KL so cone ABG is to cone CDK and cylinder EB to cylinder FD Which is the very thing it was required to show ie Proposition 15 The bases of equal cones and cylinders are recipro cally proportional to their heights And those cones and cylinders whose bases are reciprocally proportional to their heights are equal U A L D K B G X H E Z S M R J N P O T T A L D K B E S M R N C O F G H Q P U Let there be equal cones and cylinders whose bases are the circles ABCD and EFGH and the diameters of the bases AC and EG and whose axes are KL and MN which are also the heights of the cones and cylinders respectively And let the cylinders AO and EP have been completed I say that the bases of cylinders AO and EP are reciprocally proportional to their heights and so as base ABCD is to base EFGH so height MN is to height KL For height LK is either equal to height MN or not Let it rst of all be equal And cylinder AO is also equal to cylinder EP And cones and cylinders having the same height are to one another as their bases Prop 1211 Thus base ABCD is also equal to base EFGH And hence reciprocally as base ABCD is to base EFGH so height MN is to height KL And so let height LK not be equal to MN but let MN be greater And let QN equal to KL have been cut off from height MN And let the cylinder EP have been cut through point Q by the plane T US which is parallel to the planes of the circles EFGH and RP And let cylinder ES have been conceived with base the circle EFGH and height NQ And since cylinder AO is equal to cylinder EP thus as cylinder AO is to cylinder ES so cylinder EP is to cylinder ES Prop 57 But as cylinder AO is to cylin der ES so base ABCD is to base EFGH For cylinders AO and ES have the same height Prop 1211 And as cylinder EP is to cylinder ES so height MN is to height QN For cylinder EP has been cut by a plane which is parallel to its opposite planes Prop 1213 And thus as base ABCD is to base EFGH so height MN is to height QN Prop 511 And height QN 497STOIQEIWN ib ELEMENTS BOOK 12 is equal to height KL Thus as base ABCD is to base EFGH so height MN is to height KL Thus the bases of cylinders AO and EP are reciprocally proportional to their heights And so let the bases of cylinders AO and EP be reciprocally proportional to their heights and thus let base ABCD be to base EFGH as height MN is to height KL I say that cylinder AO is equal to cylinder EP For with the same construction since as base ABCD is to base EFGH so height MN is to height KL and height KL is equal to height QN thus as base ABCD is to base EFGH so height MN will be to height QN But as base ABCD is to base EFGH so cylin der AO is to cylinder ES For they are the same height Prop 1211 And as height MN is to height QN so cylinder EP is to cylinder ES Prop 1213 Thus as cylinder AO is to cylinder ES so cylinder EP is to cylinder ES Prop 511 Thus cylinder AO is equal to cylinder EP Prop 59 In the same manner the proposition can also be demonstrated for the cones Which is the very thing it was required to show i Proposition 16 There being two circles about the same center to inscribe an equilateral and evensided polygon in the greater circle not touching the lesser circle H D Z K E L N M J B A G M D K E L N B A H F C G Let ABCD and EFGH be the given two circles about the same center K So it is necessary to inscribe an equilateral and evensided polygon in the greater circle ABCD not touching circle EFGH Let the straightline BKD have been drawn through the center K And let GA have been drawn at right angles to the straightline BD through point G and let it have been drawn through to C Thus AC touches circle EFGH Prop 316 corr So by cutting circumference BAD in half and the half of it in half and doing this con tinually we will eventually leave a circumference less 498STOIQEIWN ib ELEMENTS BOOK 12 than AD Prop 101 Let it have been left and let it be LD And let LM have been drawn from L perpendicu lar to BD and let it have been drawn through to N And let LD and DN have been joined Thus LD is equal to DN Props 33 14 And since LN is parallel to AC Prop 128 and AC touches circle EFGH LN thus does not touch circle EFGH Thus even more so LD and DN do not touch circle EFGH And if we continu ously insert straightlines equal to straightline LD into circle ABCD Prop 41 then an equilateral and even sided polygon not touching the lesser circle EFGH will have been inscribed in circle ABCD Which is the very thing it was required to do Note that the chord of the polygon LN does not touch the inner circle either iz Proposition 17 There being two spheres about the same center to in scribe a polyhedral solid in the greater sphere not touch ing the lesser sphere on its surface E U D N G M L K B W A Z Q J R S T P X O Y F H U D N M L K B A R S T F H Y W Q G C O P X E V Let two spheres have been conceived about the same center A So it is necessary to inscribe a polyhedral solid in the greater sphere not touching the lesser sphere on its surface Let the spheres have been cut by some plane through the center So the sections will be circles inasmuch as a sphere is generated by the diameter remaining be hind and a semicircle being carried around Def 1114 And hence whatever position we conceive of for the semicircle the plane produced through it will make a 499STOIQEIWN ib ELEMENTS BOOK 12 circle on the surface of the sphere And it is clear that it is also a great circle inasmuch as the diam eter of the sphere which is also manifestly the diame ter of the semicircle and the circle is greater than all of the other straightlines drawn across in the cir cle or the sphere Prop 315 Therefore let BCDE be the circle in the greater sphere and FGH the circle in the lesser sphere And let two diameters of them have been drawn at rightangles to one another namely BD and CE And there being two circles about the same centernamely BCDE and FGHlet an equi lateral and evensided polygon have been inscribed in the greater circle BCDE not touching the lesser circle FGH Prop 1216 of which let the sides in the quad rant BE be BK KL LM and ME And KA being joined let it have been drawn across to N And let AO have been set up at point A at rightangles to the plane of circle BCDE And let it meet the surface of the greater sphere at O And let planes have been produced through AO and each of BD and KN So according to the afore mentioned discussion they will make great circles on the surface of the greater sphere Let them make great circles of which let BOD and KON be semicircles on the diameters BD and KN respectively And since OA is at rightangles to the plane of circle BCDE all of the planes through OA are thus also at rightangles to the plane of circle BCDE Prop 1118 And hence the semicircles BOD and KON are also at rightangles to the plane of circle BCDE And since semicircles BED BOD and KON are equalfor they are on the equal diameters BD and KN Def 31the quadrants BE BO and KO are also equal to one another Thus as many sides of the polygon as are in quadrant BE so many are also in quadrants BO and KO equal to the straightlines BK KL LM and ME Let them have been inscribed and let them be BP PQ QR RO KS ST T U and UO And let SP T Q and UR have been joined And let perpendiculars have been drawn from P and S to the plane of circle BCDE Prop 1111 So they will fall on the common sections of the planes BD and KN with BCDE inasmuch as the planes of BOD and KON are also at rightangles to the plane of circle BCDE Def 114 Let them have fallen and let them be PV and SW And let WV have been joined And since BP and KS are equal circumferences having been cut off in the equal semicircles BOD and KON Def 328 and PV and SW are perpendiculars having been drawn from them PV is thus equal to SW and BV to KW Props 327 126 And the whole of BA is also equal to the whole of KA And thus as BV is to V A so KW is to WA WV is thus parallel to KB Prop 62 And 500STOIQEIWN ib ELEMENTS BOOK 12 since PV and SW are each at rightangles to the plane of circle BCDE PV is thus parallel to SW Prop 116 And it was also shown to be equal to it And thus WV and SP are equal and parallel Prop 133 And since WV is parallel to SP but WV is parallel to KB SP is thus also parallel to KB Prop 111 And BP and KS join them Thus the quadrilateral KBPS is in one plane inasmuch as if there are two parallel straight lines and a random point is taken on each of them then the straightline joining the points is in the same plane as the parallel straightlines Prop 117 So for the same reasons each of the quadrilaterals SPQT and T QRU is also in one plane And triangle URO is also in one plane Prop 112 So if we conceive straight lines joining points P S Q T R and U to A then some solid polyhedral gure will have been constructed between the circumferences BO and KO being com posed of pyramids whose bases are the quadrilaterals KBPS SPQT T QRU and the triangle URO and apex the point A And if we also make the same construction on each of the sides KL LM and ME just as on BK and further repeat the construction in the remaining three quadrants then some polyhedral gure which has been inscribed in the sphere will have been constructed being contained by pyramids whose bases are the afore mentioned quadrilaterals and triangle URO and the quadrilaterals and triangles similarly arranged to them and apex the point A So I say that the aforementioned polyhedron will not touch the lesser sphere on the surface on which the circle FGH is situated Let the perpendicular straightline AX have been drawn from point A to the plane KBPS and let it meet the plane at point X Prop 1111 And let XB and XK have been joined And since AX is at rightangles to the plane of quadrilateral KBPS it is thus also at right angles to all of the straightlines joined to it which are also in the plane of the quadrilateral Def 113 Thus AX is at rightangles to each of BX and XK And since AB is equal to AK the square on AB is also equal to the square on AK And the sum of the squares on AX and XB is equal to the square on AB For the angle at X is a rightangle Prop 147 And the sum of the squares on AX and XK is equal to the square on AK Prop 147 Thus the sum of the squares on AX and XB is equal to the sum of the squares on AX and XK Let the square on AX have been subtracted from both Thus the remaining square on BX is equal to the remaining square on XK Thus BX is equal to XK So similarly we can show that the straightlines joined from X to P and S are equal to each of BX and XK 501STOIQEIWN ib ELEMENTS BOOK 12 Thus a circle drawn in the plane of the quadrilateral with center X and radius one of XB or XK will also pass through P and S and the quadrilateral KBPS will be inside the circle And since KB is greater than WV and WV is equal to SP KB is thus greater than SP And KB is equal to each of KS and BP Thus KS and BP are each greater than SP And since quadrilateral KBPS is in a circle and KB BP and KS are equal to one another and PS is less than them and BX is the radius of the circle the square on KB is thus greater than double the square on BX Let the perpendicular KY have been drawn from K to BV And since BD is less than double DY and as BD is to DY so the rect angle contained by DB and BY is to the rectangle contained by DY and Y Ba square being described on BY and a rectangular parallelogram with short side equal to BY completed on Y Dthe rectangle con tained by DB and BY is thus also less than double the rectangle contained by DY and Y B And KD being joined the rectangle contained by DB and BY is equal to the square on BK and the rectangle contained by DY and Y B equal to the square on KY Props 331 68 corr Thus the square on KB is less than double the square on KY But the square on KB is greater than double the square on BX Thus the square on KY is greater than the square on BX And since BA is equal to KA the square on BA is equal to the square on AK And the sum of the squares on BX and XA is equal to the square on BA and the sum of the squares on KY and Y A is equal to the square on KA Prop 147 Thus the sum of the squares on BX and XA is equal to the sum of the squares on KY and Y A of which the square on KY is greater than the square on BX Thus the remaining square on Y A is less than the square on XA Thus AX is greater than AY Thus AX is much greater than AG And AX is a perpendicular on one of the bases of the polyhe dron and AG is a perpendicular on the surface of the lesser sphere Hence the polyhedron will not touch the lesser sphere on its surface Thus there being two spheres about the same cen ter a polyhedral solid has been inscribed in the greater sphere which does not touch the lesser sphere on its sur face Which is the very thing it was required to do Since KB BP and KS are greater than the sides of an inscribed square which are each of length 2 BX Note that points Y and V are actually identical This conclusion depends on the fact that the chord of the polygon in proposition 1216 does not touch the inner circle 502STOIQEIWN ib ELEMENTS BOOK 12 Pri sma Corollary And also if a similar polyhedral solid to that in sphere BCDE is inscribed in another sphere then the polyhedral solid in sphere BCDE has to the polyhedral solid in the other sphere the cubed ratio that the diameter of sphere BCDE has to the diameter of the other sphere For if the solids are divided into similarly numbered and similarly situated pyramids then the pyramids will be similar And similar pyramids are in the cubed ratio of corresponding sides Prop 128 corr Thus the pyra mid whose base is quadrilateral KBPS and apex the point A will have to the similarly situated pyramid in the other sphere the cubed ratio that a corresponding side has to a corresponding side That is to say that of ra dius AB of the sphere about center A to the radius of the other sphere And similarly each pyramid in the sphere about center A will have to each similarly situated pyra mid in the other sphere the cubed ratio that AB has to the radius of the other sphere And as one of the leading magnitudes is to one of the following in two sets of proportional magnitudes so the sum of all the lead ing magnitudes is to the sum of all of the following magnitudes Prop 512 Hence the whole polyhedral solid in the sphere about center A will have to the whole polyhedral solid in the other sphere the cubed ratio that radius AB has to the radius of the other sphere That is to say that diameter BD has to the diameter of the other sphere Which is the very thing it was required to show ih Proposition 18 Spheres are to one another in the cubed ratio of their respective diameters D L E J K H G N A B Z M G L E K N A B M D C H F 503STOIQEIWN ib ELEMENTS BOOK 12 Let the spheres ABC and DEF have been conceived and let their diameters be BC and EF respectively I say that sphere ABC has to sphere DEF the cubed ratio that BC has to EF For if sphere ABC does not have to sphere DEF the cubed ratio that BC has to EF then sphere ABC will have to some sphere either less than or greater than sphere DEF the cubed ratio that BC has to EF Let it rst of all have such a ratio to a lesser sphere GHK And let DEF have been conceived about the same center as GHK And let a polyhedral solid have been inscribed in the greater sphere DEF not touching the lesser sphere GHK on its surface Prop 1217 And let a polyhedral solid similar to the polyhedral solid in sphere DEF have also been inscribed in sphere ABC Thus the polyhedral solid in sphere ABC has to the polyhedral solid in sphere DEF the cubed ratio that BC has to EF Prop 1217 corr And sphere ABC also has to sphere GHK the cubed ratio that BC has to EF Thus as sphere ABC is to sphere GHK so the polyhe dral solid in sphere ABC is to the polyhedral solid is sphere DEF Thus alternately as sphere ABC is to the polygon within it so sphere GHK is to the polyhe dral solid within sphere DEF Prop 516 And sphere ABC is greater than the polyhedron within it Thus sphere GHK is also greater than the polyhedron within sphere DEF Prop 514 But it is also less For it is encompassed by it Thus sphere ABC does not have to a sphere less than sphere DEF the cubed ratio that di ameter BC has to EF So similarly we can show that sphere DEF does not have to a sphere less than sphere ABC the cubed ratio that EF has to BC either So I say that sphere ABC does not have to some sphere greater than sphere DEF the cubed ratio that BC has to EF either For if possible let it have the cubed ratio to a greater sphere LMN Thus inversely sphere LMN has to sphere ABC the cubed ratio that diameter EF has to diameter BC Prop 57 corr And as sphere LMN is to sphere ABC so sphere DEF is to some sphere less than sphere ABC inasmuch as LMN is greater than DEF as was shown before Prop 122 lem And thus sphere DEF has to some sphere less than sphere ABC the cubed ratio that EF has to BC The very thing was shown to be impossi ble Thus sphere ABC does not have to some sphere greater than sphere DEF the cubed ratio that BC has to EF And it was shown that neither does it have such a ratio to a lesser sphere Thus sphere ABC has to sphere DEF the cubed ratio that BC has to EF Which is the very thing it was required to show 504ELEMENTS BOOK 13 The Platonic Solids The ve regular solidsthe cube tetrahedron ie pyramid octahedron icosahedron and

to G And since AB has been cut in extreme and mean ratio at C the rectangle contained by ABC is thus equal to the square on AC Def 63 Prop 617 And CE is the rectangle contained by ABC and FH the square on AC Thus CE is equal to FH And since BA is double AD and BA is equal to KA and AD to AH KA is thus also double AH And as KA is to AH so CK is to CH Prop 61 Thus CK is double CH And LH plus HC is also double CH Prop 143 Thus KC is equal to LH plus HC And CE was also shown to be equal to HF Thus the whole square AE is equal to the gnomon MNO And since BA is double AD the square on BA is four times the square on ADthat is to say AE is four times DH And AE is equal to gnomon MNO And thus gnomon MNO is also four times AP Thus the whole of DF is ve times AP And DF is the square on DC and AP the square on DA Thus the square on CD is ve times the square on DA Thus if a straightline is cut in extreme and mean ra tio then the square on the greater piece added to half of 506STOIQEIWN ig ELEMENTS BOOK 13 the whole is ve times the square on the half Which is the very thing it was required to show b Proposition 2 If the square on a straightline is ve times the square on a piece of it and double the aforementioned piece is cut in extreme and mean ratio then the greater piece is the remaining part of the original straightline G Z L N X K J M A B D E H O L N K M A B D E C H G F For let the square on the straightline AB be ve times the square on the piece of it AC And let CD be double AC I say that if CD is cut in extreme and mean ratio then the greater piece is CB For let the squares AF and CG have been described on each of AB and CD respectively And let the gure in AF have been drawn And let BE have been drawn across And since the square on BA is ve times the square on AC AF is ve times AH Thus gnomon MNO is four times AH And since DC is double CA the square on DC is thus four times the square on CAthat is to say CG is four times AH And the gnomon MNO was also shown to be four times AH Thus gnomon MNO is equal to CG And since DC is double CA and DC is equal to CK and AC to CH KC is thus also double CH and KB is also dou ble BH Prop 61 And LH plus HB is also double HB Prop 143 Thus KB is equal to LH plus HB And the whole gnomon MNO was also shown to be equal to the whole of CG Thus the remainder HF is also equal to the remainder BG And BG is the rectangle contained by CDB For CD is equal to DG And HF is the square on CB Thus the rectangle contained by CDB is equal to the square on CB Thus as DC is to CB so CB is to BD Prop 617 And DC is greater than CB see lemma Thus CB is also greater than BD Prop 514 Thus if the straightline CD is cut 507STOIQEIWN ig ELEMENTS BOOK 13 in extreme and mean ratio then the greater piece is CB Thus if the square on a straightline is ve times the square on a piece of itself and double the afore mentioned piece is cut in extreme and mean ratio then the greater piece is the remaining part of the original straightline Which is the very thing it was required to show Lmma Lemma And it can be shown that double AC ie DC is greater than BC as follows For if double AC is not greater than BC if possi ble let BC be double CA Thus the square on BC is four times the square on CA Thus the sum of the squares on BC and CA is ve times the square on CA And the square on BA was assumed to be ve times the square on CA Thus the square on BA is equal to the sum of the squares on BC and CA The very thing is impossible Prop 24 Thus CB is not double AC So similarly we can show that a straight line less than CB is not double AC either For in this case the absurdity is much greater Thus double AC is greater than CB Which is the very thing it was required to show g Proposition 3 If a straightline is cut in extreme and mean ratio then the square on the lesser piece added to half of the greater piece is ve times the square on half of the greater piece S R G M N E K Z B A J O H D L P X Q R M N E K B A D L S F O G C H P For let some straightline AB have been cut in ex treme and mean ratio at point C And let AC be the greater piece And let AC have been cut in half at D I say that the square on BD is ve times the square on DC 508STOIQEIWN ig ELEMENTS BOOK 13 For let the square AE have been described on AB And let the gure have been drawn double Since AC is double DC the square on AC is thus four times the square on DCthat is to say RS is four times FG And since the rectangle contained by ABC is equal to the square on AC Def 63 Prop 617 and CE is the rectangle contained by ABC CE is thus equal to RS And RS is four times FG Thus CE is also four times FG Again since AD is equal to DC HK is also equal to KF Hence square GF is also equal to square HL Thus GK is equal to KLthat is to say MN to NE Hence MF is also equal to FE But MF is equal to CG Thus CG is also equal to FE Let CN have been added to both Thus gnomon OPQ is equal to CE But CE was shown to be equal to four times GF Thus gnomon OPQ is also four times square FG Thus gnomon OPQ plus square FG is ve times FG But gnomon OPQ plus square FG is square DN And DN is the square on DB and GF the square on DC Thus the square on DB is ve times the square on DC Which is the very thing it was required to show d Proposition 4 If a straightline is cut in extreme and mean ratio then the sum of the squares on the whole and the lesser piece is three times the square on the greater piece A G B K J D H E M L N Z A B K D E M L N H C G F Let AB be a straightline and let it have been cut in extreme and mean ratio at C and let AC be the greater piece I say that the sum of the squares on AB and BC is three times the square on CA For let the square ADEB have been described on AB and let the remainder of the gure have been drawn Therefore since AB has been cut in extreme and mean ratio at C and AC is the greater piece the rectangle 509STOIQEIWN ig ELEMENTS BOOK 13 contained by ABC is thus equal to the square on AC Def 63 Prop 617 And AK is the rectangle con tained by ABC and HG the square on AC Thus AK is equal to HG And since AF is equal to FE Prop 143 let CK have been added to both Thus the whole of AK is equal to the whole of CE Thus AK plus CE is double AK But AK plus CE is the gnomon LMN plus the square CK Thus gnomon LMN plus square CK is double AK But indeed AK was also shown to be equal to HG Thus gnomon LMN plus square CK is double HG Hence gnomon LMN plus the squares CK and HG is three times the square HG And gnomon LMN plus the squares CK and HG is the whole of AE plus CKwhich are the squares on AB and BC respectivelyand GH is the square on AC Thus the sum of the squares on AB and BC is three times the square on AC Which is the very thing it was required to show e Proposition 5 If a straightline is cut in extreme and mean ratio and a straightline equal to the greater piece is added to it then the whole straightline has been cut in extreme and mean ratio and the original straightline is the greater piece J D A G B K E L C D A B K E L H For let the straightline AB have been cut in extreme and mean ratio at point C And let AC be the greater piece And let AD be made equal to AC I say that the straightline DB has been cut in extreme and mean ratio at A and that the original straightline AB is the greater piece For let the square AE have been described on AB and let the remainder of the gure have been drawn And since AB has been cut in extreme and mean ratio at C the rectangle contained by ABC is thus equal to the square on AC Def 63 Prop 617 And CE is the rectangle contained by ABC and CH the square on AC But HE is equal to CE Prop 143 and DH equal 510STOIQEIWN ig ELEMENTS BOOK 13 to HC Thus DH is also equal to HE Let HB have been added to both Thus the whole of DK is equal to the whole of AE And DK is the rectangle contained by BD and DA For AD is equal to DL And AE is the square on AB Thus the rectangle contained by BDA is equal to the square on AB Thus as DB is to BA so BA is to AD Prop 617 And DB is greater than BA Thus BA is also greater than AD Prop 514 Thus DB has been cut in extreme and mean ratio at A and the greater piece is AB Which is the very thing it was required to show Proposition 6 If a rational straightline is cut in extreme and mean ratio then each of the pieces is that irrational straight line called an apotome G D A B C D A B Let AB be a rational straightline cut in extreme and mean ratio at C and let AC be the greater piece I say that AC and CB is each that irrational straightline called an apotome For let BA have been produced and let AD be made equal to half of BA Therefore since the straight line AB has been cut in extreme and mean ratio at C and AD which is half of AB has been added to the greater piece AC the square on CD is thus ve times the square on DA Prop 131 Thus the square on CD has to the square on DA the ratio which a number has to a number The square on CD is thus com mensurable with the square on DA Prop 106 And the square on DA is rational For DA is rational being half of AB which is rational Thus the square on CD is also rational Def 104 Thus CD is also rational And since the square on CD does not have to the square on DA the ratio which a square num ber has to a square number CD is thus incommensu rable in length with DA Prop 109 Thus CD and DA are rational straightlines which are commensurable in square only Thus AC is an apotome Prop 1073 Again since AB has been cut in extreme and mean ratio and AC is the greater piece the rectangle contained by AB and BC is thus equal to the square on AC Def 63 Prop 617 Thus the square on the apotome AC ap plied to the rational straightline AB makes BC as width And the square on an apotome applied to a rational straightline makes a rst apotome as width Prop 1097 Thus CB is a rst apotome And CA was also shown to be an apotome 511STOIQEIWN ig ELEMENTS BOOK 13 Thus if a rational straightline is cut in extreme and mean ratio then each of the pieces is that irrational straightline called an apotome z Proposition 7 If three angles either consecutive or not consecutive of an equilateral pentagon are equal then the pentagon will be equiangular D B Z G E A C B E A D F For let three angles of the equilateral pentagon ABCDErst of all the consecutive angles at A B and Cbe equal to one another I say that pentagon ABCDE is equiangular For let AC BE and FD have been joined And since the two straightlines CB and BA are equal to the two straightlines BA and AE respectively and angle CBA is equal to angle BAE base AC is thus equal to base BE and triangle ABC equal to triangle ABE and the remaining angles will be equal to the remaining angles which the equal sides subtend Prop 14 that is BCA equal to BEA and ABE to CAB And hence side AF is also equal to side BF Prop 16 And the whole of AC was also shown to be equal to the whole of BE Thus the remainder FC is also equal to the remainder FE And CD is also equal to DE So the two straightlines FC and CD are equal to the two straightlines FE and ED respectively And FD is their common base Thus angle FCD is equal to angle FED Prop 18 And BCA was also shown to be equal to AEB And thus the whole of BCD is equal to the whole of AED But angle BCD was assumed to be equal to the angles at A and B Thus angle AED is also equal to the angles at A and B So similarly we can show that angle CDE is also equal to the angles at A B C Thus pentagon ABCDE is equiangular And so let consecutive angles not be equal but let the angles at points A C and D be equal I say that pentagon ABCDE is also equiangular in this case For let BD have been joined And since the two 512STOIQEIWN ig ELEMENTS BOOK 13 straightlines BA and AE are equal to the straight lines BC and CD and they contain equal angles base BE is thus equal to base BD and triangle ABE is equal to triangle BCD and the remaining angles will be equal to the remaining angles which the equal sides subtend Prop 14 Thus angle AEB is equal to angle CDB And angle BED is also equal to angle BDE since side BE is also equal to side BD Prop 15 Thus the whole angle AED is also equal to the whole angle CDE But angle CDE was assumed to be equal to the angles at A and C Thus angle AED is also equal to the angles at A and C So for the same reasons angle ABC is also equal to the angles at A C and D Thus pentagon ABCDE is equiangular Which is the very thing it was required to show h Proposition 8 If straightlines subtend two consecutive angles of an equilateral and equiangular pentagon then they cut one another in extreme and mean ratio and their greater pieces are equal to the sides of the pentagon J B A D G E H B A D E C For let the two straightlines AC and BE cutting one another at point H have subtended two consecutive an gles at A and B respectively of the equilateral and equiangular pentagon ABCDE I say that each of them has been cut in extreme and mean ratio at point H and that their greater pieces are equal to the sides of the pen tagon For let the circle ABCDE have been circumscribed about pentagon ABCDE Prop 414 And since the two straightlines EA and AB are equal to the two straight lines AB and BC respectively and they contain equal angles the base BE is thus equal to the base AC and tri angle ABE is equal to triangle ABC and the remaining angles will be equal to the remaining angles respectively which the equal sides subtend Prop 14 Thus angle BAC is equal to angle ABE Thus angle AHE is double angle BAH Prop 132 And EAC is also dou 513STOIQEIWN ig ELEMENTS BOOK 13 ble BAC inasmuch as circumference EDC is also dou ble circumference CB Props 328 633 Thus angle HAE is equal to angle AHE Hence straightline HE is also equal to straightline EAthat is to say to straightline AB Prop 16 And since straightline BA is equal to AE angle ABE is also equal to AEB Prop 15 But ABE was shown to be equal to BAH Thus BEA is also equal to BAH And angle ABE is common to the two triangles ABE and ABH Thus the remaining angle BAE is equal to the remaining angle AHB Prop 132 Thus triangle ABE is equiangular to triangle ABH Thus proportionally as EB is to BA so AB is to BH Prop 64 And BA is equal to EH Thus as BE is to EH so EH is to HB And BE is greater than EH EH is thus also greater than HB Prop 514 Thus BE has been cut in extreme and mean ratio at H and the greater piece HE is equal to the side of the pentagon So similarly we can show that AC has also been cut in extreme and mean ratio at H and that its greater piece CH is equal to the side of the pentagon Which is the very thing it was required to show j Proposition 9 If the side of a hexagon and of a decagon inscribed in the same circle are added together then the whole straightline has been cut in extreme and mean ratio at the junction point and its greater piece is the side of the hexagon A E G Z D B F E D B A C Let ABC be a circle And of the gures inscribed in circle ABC let BC be the side of a decagon and CD the side of a hexagon And let them be laid down straight on to one another I say that the whole straightline BD has been cut in extreme and mean ratio at C and that CD is its greater piece For let the center of the circle point E have been 514STOIQEIWN ig ELEMENTS BOOK 13 found Prop 31 and let EB EC and ED have been joined and let BE have been drawn across to A Since BC is a side on an equilateral decagon circumference ACB is thus ve times circumference BC Thus cir cumference AC is four times CB And as circumference AC is to CB so angle AEC is to CEB Prop 633 Thus angle AEC is four times CEB And since angle EBC is equal to ECB Prop 15 angle AEC is thus double ECB Prop 132 And since straightline EC is equal to CDfor each of them is equal to the side of the hexagon inscribed in circle ABC Prop 415 corr angle CED is also equal to angle CDE Prop 15 Thus angle ECB is double EDC Prop 132 But AEC was shown to be double ECB Thus AEC is four times EDC And AEC was also shown to be four times BEC Thus EDC is equal to BEC And angle EBD is common to the two triangles BEC and BED Thus the remaining angle BED is equal to the remaining angle ECB Prop 132 Thus triangle EBD is equian gular to triangle EBC Thus proportionally as DB is to BE so EB is to BC Prop 64 And EB is equal to CD Thus as BD is to DC so DC is to CB And BD is greater than DC Thus DC is also greater than CB Prop 514 Thus the straightline BD has been cut in extreme and mean ratio at C and DC is its greater piece Which is the very thing it was required to show If the circle is of unit radius then the side of the hexagon is 1 whereas the side of the decagon is 12 5 1 i Proposition 10 If an equilateral pentagon is inscribed in a circle then the square on the side of the pentagon is equal to the sum of the squares on the sides of the hexagon and of the decagon inscribed in the same circle L H Z K A E G D B N M J E K A B N M G C F H L D 515STOIQEIWN ig ELEMENTS BOOK 13 Let ABCDE be a circle And let the equilateral pen tagon ABCDE have been inscribed in circle ABCDE I say that the square on the side of pentagon ABCDE is the sum of the squares on the sides of the hexagon and of the decagon inscribed in circle ABCDE For let the center of the circle point F have been found Prop 31 And AF being joined let it have been drawn across to point G And let FB have been joined And let FH have been drawn from F perpendicular to AB And let it have been drawn across to K And let AK and KB have been joined And again let FL have been drawn from F perpendicular to AK And let it have been drawn across to M And let KN have been joined Since circumference ABCG is equal to circumference AEDG of which ABC is equal to AED the remain ing circumference CG is thus equal to the remaining circumference GD And CD is the side of the pen tagon CG is thus the side of the decagon And since FA is equal to FB and FH is perpendicular to AB angle AFK is thus also equal to KFB Props 15 126 Hence circumference AK is also equal to KB Prop 326 Thus circumference AB is double cir cumference BK Thus straightline AK is the side of the decagon So for the same reasons circumference AK is also double KM And since circumference AB is double circumference BK and circumference CD is equal to circumference AB circumference CD is thus also double circumference BK And circumference CD is also double CG Thus circumference CG is equal to circumference BK But BK is double KM since KA is also double KM Thus circumference CG is also double KM But indeed circumference CB is also double circumference BK For circumference CB is equal to BA Thus the whole circumference GB is also double BM Hence angle GFB is also dou ble angle BFM Prop 633 And GFB is also dou ble FAB For FAB is equal to ABF Thus BFN is also equal to FAB And angle ABF is common to the two triangles ABF and BFN Thus the remain ing angle AFB is equal to the remaining angle BNF Prop 132 Thus triangle ABF is equiangular to trian gle BFN Thus proportionally as straightline AB is to BF so FB is to BN Prop 64 Thus the rectan gle contained by ABN is equal to the square on BF Prop 617 Again since AL is equal to LK and LN is common and at rightangles to KA base KN is thus equal to base AN Prop 14 And thus angle LKN is equal to angle LAN But LAN is equal to KBN Props 329 15 Thus LKN is also equal to KBN And the angle at A is common to the two triangles AKB and AKN Thus the remaining angle AKB is 516STOIQEIWN ig ELEMENTS BOOK 13 equal to the remaining angle KNA Prop 132 Thus triangle KBA is equiangular to triangle KNA Thus proportionally as straightline BA is to AK so KA is to AN Prop 64 Thus the rectangle contained by BAN is equal to the square on AK Prop 617 And the rectangle contained by ABN was also shown to be equal to the square on BF Thus the rectangle con tained by ABN plus the rectangle contained by BAN which is the square on BA Prop 22 is equal to the square on BF plus the square on AK And BA is the side of the pentagon and BF the side of the hexagon Prop 415 corr and AK the side of the decagon Thus the square on the side of the pentagon in scribed in a circle is equal to the sum of the squares on the sides of the hexagon and of the decagon in scribed in the same circle If the circle is of unit radius then the side of the pentagon is 12 p 10 2 5 ia Proposition 11 If an equilateral pentagon is inscribed in a circle which has a rational diameter then the side of the pentagon is that irrational straightline called minor D A H E M N B G L Z K J F A E M N B L K D C G H For let the equilateral pentagon ABCDE have been inscribed in the circle ABCDE which has a rational di ameter I say that the side of pentagon ABCDE is that irrational straightline called minor For let the center of the circle point F have been found Prop 31 And let AF and FB have been joined And let them have been drawn across to points G and H respectively And let AC have been joined And let FK made equal to the fourth part of AF And AF is ratio nal FK is thus also rational And BF is also rational Thus the whole of BK is rational And since circum ference ACG is equal to circumference ADG of which 517STOIQEIWN ig ELEMENTS BOOK 13 ABC is equal to AED the remainder CG is thus equal to the remainder GD And if we join AD then the angles at L are inferred to be rightangles and CD is inferred to be double CL Prop 14 So for the same reasons the angles at M are also rightangles and AC is dou ble CM Therefore since angle ALC is equal to AMF and angle LAC is common to the two triangles ACL and AMF the remaining angle ACL is thus equal to the remaining angle MFA Prop 132 Thus triangle ACL is equiangular to triangle AMF Thus proportion ally as LC is to CA so MF is to FA Prop 64 And we can take the doubles of the leading magnitudes Thus as double LC is to CA so double MF is to FA And as double MF is to FA so MF is to half of FA And thus as double LC is to CA so MF is to half of FA And we can take the halves of the following magnitudes Thus as double LC is to half of CA so MF is to the fourth of FA And DC is double LC and CM half of CA and FK the fourth part of FA Thus as DC is to CM so MF is to FK Via composition as the sum of DCM ie DC and CM is to CM so MK is to KF Prop 518 And thus as the square on the sum of DCM is to the square on CM so the square on MK is to the square on KF And since the greater piece of a straightline subtending two sides of a pen tagon such as AC which is cut in extreme and mean ratio is equal to the side of the pentagon Prop 138 that is to say to DCand the square on the greater piece added to half of the whole is ve times the square on half of the whole Prop 131 and CM is half of the whole AC thus the square on DCM taken as one is ve times the square on CM And the square on DCM taken as one is to the square on CM so the square on MK was shown to be to the square on KF Thus the square on MK is ve times the square on KF And the square on KF is rational For the diameter is rational Thus the square on MK is also rational Thus MK is rational in square only And since BF is four times FK BK is thus ve times KF Thus the square on BK is twentyve times the square on KF And the square on MK is ve times the square on KF Thus the square on BK is ve times the square on KM Thus the square on BK does not have to the square on KM the ratio which a square number has to a square num ber Thus BK is incommensurable in length with KM Prop 109 And each of them is a rational straight line Thus BK and KM are rational straightlines which are commensurable in square only And if from a rational straightline a rational straightline is sub tracted which is commensurable in square only with the 518STOIQEIWN ig ELEMENTS BOOK 13 whole then the remainder is that irrational straightline called an apotome Prop 1073 Thus MB is an apo tome and MK its attachment So I say that it is also a fourth apotome So let the square on N be made equal to that magnitude by which the square on BK is greater than the square on KM Thus the square on BK is greater than the square on KM by the square on N And since KF is commensurable in length with FB then via composition KB is also commensurable in length with FB Prop 1015 But BF is commensu rable in length with BH Thus BK is also commen surable in length with BH Prop 1012 And since the square on BK is ve times the square on KM the square on BK thus has to the square on KM the ratio which 5 has to one Thus via conversion the square on BK has to the square on N the ratio which 5 has to 4 Prop 519 corr which is not that of a square number to a square number BK is thus in commensurable in length with N Prop 109 Thus the square on BK is greater than the square on KM by the square on some straightline which is incom mensurable in length with BK Therefore since the square on the whole BK is greater than the square on the attachment KM by the square on some straight line which is incommensurable in length with BK and the whole BK is commensurable in length with the previously laid down rational straightline BH MB is thus a fourth apotome Def 1014 And the rectangle contained by a rational straightline and a fourth apotome is irrational and its squareroot is that irrational straightline called minor Prop 1094 And the square on AB is the rectangle contained by HBM on account of joining AH so that triangle ABH be comes equiangular with triangle ABM Prop 68 and proportionally as HB is to BA so AB is to BM Thus the side AB of the pentagon is that irrational straightline called minor Which is the very thing it was required to show If the circle has unit radius then the side of the pentagon is 12 p 10 2 5 However this length can be written in the minor form see Prop 1094 2 q 1 k 1 k2 2 q 1 k 1 k2 with p 52 and k 2 ib Proposition 12 If an equilateral triangle is inscribed in a circle then the square on the side of the triangle is three times the square on the radius of the circle Let there be a circle ABC and let the equilateral tri angle ABC have been inscribed in it Prop 42 I say that the square on one side of triangle ABC is three times the square on the radius of circle ABC 519STOIQEIWN ig ELEMENTS BOOK 13 B G E D A C E D A B For let the center D of circle ABC have been found Prop 31 And AD being joined let it have been drawn across to E And let BE have been joined And since triangle ABC is equilateral circumference BEC is thus the third part of the circumference of cir cle ABC Thus circumference BE is the sixth part of the circumference of the circle Thus straightline BE is the side of a hexagon Thus it is equal to the radius DE Prop 415 corr And since AE is double DE the square on AE is four times the square on EDthat is to say of the square on BE And the square on AE is equal to the sum of the squares on AB and BE Props 331 147 Thus the sum of the squares on AB and BE is four times the square on BE Thus via separation the square on AB is three times the square on BE And BE is equal to DE Thus the square on AB is three times the square on DE Thus the square on the side of the triangle is three times the square on the radius of the circle Which is the very thing it was required to show ig Proposition 13 To construct a regular pyramid ie a tetrahedron and to enclose it in a given sphere and to show that the square on the diameter of the sphere is one and a half times the square on the side of the pyramid 520STOIQEIWN ig ELEMENTS BOOK 13 D J K E G A B H Z L H K E A B L D C F G Let the diameter AB of the given sphere be laid out and let it have been cut at point C such that AC is double CB Prop 610 And let the semicircle ADB have been drawn on AB And let CD have been drawn from point C at rightangles to AB And let DA have been joined And let the circle EFG be laid down having a radius equal to DC and let the equilateral triangle EFG have been inscribed in circle EFG Prop 42 And let the center of the circle point H have been found Prop 31 And let EH HF and HG have been joined And let HK have been set up at point H at rightangles to the plane of circle EFG Prop 1112 And let HK equal to the straightline AC have been cut off from HK And let KE KF and KG have been joined And since KH is at rightangles to the plane of circle EFG it will thus also make rightangles with all of the straightlines joining it which are also in the plane of circle EFG Def 113 And HE HF and HG each join it Thus HK is at rightangles to each of HE HF and HG And since AC is equal to HK and CD to HE and they contain rightangles the base DA is thus equal to the base KE Prop 14 So for the same reasons KF and KG is each equal to DA Thus the three straightlines KE KF and KG are equal to one another And since AC is double CB AB is thus triple BC And as AB is to BC so the square on AD is to the square on DC as will be shown later see lemma Thus the square on AD is three times the square on DC And the square on FE is also three times the square on EH Prop 1312 and DC is equal to EH Thus DA is 521STOIQEIWN ig ELEMENTS BOOK 13 also equal to EF But DA was shown to be equal to each of KE KF and KG Thus EF FG and GE are equal to KE KF and KG respectively Thus the four triangles EFG KEF KFG and KEG are equilateral Thus a pyramid whose base is triangle EFG and apex the point K has been constructed from four equilateral triangles So it is also necessary to enclose it in the given sphere and to show that the square on the diameter of the sphere is one and a half times the square on the side of the pyramid For let the straightline HL have been produced in a straightline with KH and let HL be made equal to CB And since as AC is to CD so CD is to CB Prop 68 corr and AC is equal to KH and CD to HE and CB to HL thus as KH is to HE so EH is to HL Thus the rectangle contained by KH and HL is equal to the square on EH Prop 617 And each of the angles KHE and EHL is a rightangle Thus the semicircle drawn on KL will also pass through E inasmuch as if we join EL then the angle LEK be comes a rightangle on account of triangle ELK becom ing equiangular to each of the triangles ELH and EHK Props 68 331 So if KL remains xed and the semicircle is carried around and again established at the same position from which it began to be moved it will also pass through points F and G because if FL and LG are joined the angles at F and G will similarly be come rightangles And the pyramid will have been en closed by the given sphere For the diameter KL of the sphere is equal to the diameter AB of the given sphere inasmuch as KH was made equal to AC and HL to CB So I say that the square on the diameter of the sphere is one and a half times the square on the side of the pyramid For since AC is double CB AB is thus triple BC Thus via conversion BA is one and a half times AC And as BA is to AC so the square on BA is to the square on AD inasmuch as if DB is joined then as BA is to AD so DA is to AC on account of the similarity of triangles DAB and DAC And as the rst is to the third of four proportional magnitudes so the square on the rst is to the square on the second Thus the square on BA is also one and a half times the square on AD And BA is the diameter of the given sphere and AD is equal to the side of the pyramid Thus the square on the diameter of the sphere is one and a half times the square on the side of the pyramid Which is the very thing it was required to show If the radius of the sphere is unity then the side of the pyramid ie tetrahedron is p 83 522STOIQEIWN ig ELEMENTS BOOK 13 G D E Z B A C D E B A F Lmma Lemma It must be shown that as AB is to BC so the square on AD is to the square on DC For let the gure of the semicircle have been set out and let DB have been joined And let the square EC have been described on AC And let the parallel ogram FB have been completed Therefore since on account of triangle DAB being equiangular to triangle DAC Props 68 64 proportionally as BA is to AD so DA is to AC the rectangle contained by BA and AC is thus equal to the square on AD Prop 617 And since as AB is to BC so EB is to BF Prop 61 v And EB is the rectangle contained by BA and ACfor EA is equal to AC And BF the rectangle contained by AC and CB Thus as AB is to BC so the rectan gle contained by BA and AC is to the rectangle con tained by AC and CB And the rectangle contained by BA and AC is equal to the square on AD and the rectangle contained by ACB is equal to the square on DC For the perpendicular DC is the mean propor tional to the pieces of the base AC and CB on account of ADB being a rightangle Prop 68 corr Thus as AB is to BC so the square on AD is to the square on DC Which is the very thing it was required to show id Proposition 14 To construct an octahedron and to enclose it in a given sphere like in the preceding proposition and to show that the square on the diameter of the sphere is double the square on the side of the octahedron Let the diameter AB of the given sphere be laid out and let it have been cut in half at C And let the semi circle ADB have been drawn on AB And let CD be drawn from C at rightangles to AB And let DB have 523STOIQEIWN ig ELEMENTS BOOK 13 been joined And let the square EFGH having each of its sides equal to DB be laid out And let HF and EG have been joined And let the straightline KL have been set up at point K at rightangles to the plane of square EFGH Prop 1112 And let it have been drawn across on the other side of the plane like KM And let KL and KM equal to one of EK FK GK and HK have been cut off from KL and KM respectively And let LE LF LG LH ME MF MG and MH have been joined G D A B M E L K F C H H D A B E L K F C G M And since KE is equal to KH and angle EKH is a rightangle the square on the HE is thus double the square on EK Prop 147 Again since LK is equal to KE and angle LKE is a rightangle the square on EL is thus double the square on EK Prop 147 And the square on HE was also shown to be double the square on EK Thus the square on LE is equal to the square on EH Thus LE is equal to EH So for the same reasons LH is also equal to HE Triangle LEH is thus equilateral So similarly we can show that each of the remaining triangles whose bases are the sides of the square EFGH and apexes the points L and M are equilateral Thus an octahedron contained by eight equilateral triangles has been constructed So it is also necessary to enclose it by the given sphere and to show that the square on the diameter of the sphere is double the square on the side of the octa hedron For since the three straightlines LK KM and KE are equal to one another the semicircle drawn on LM will thus also pass through E And for the same rea sons if LM remains xed and the semicircle is car 524STOIQEIWN ig ELEMENTS BOOK 13 ried around and again established at the same position from which it began to be moved then it will also pass through points F G and H and the octahedron will have been enclosed by a sphere So I say that it is also enclosed by the given sphere For since LK is equal to KM and KE is common and they contain rightangles the base LE is thus equal to the base EM Prop 14 And since angle LEM is a rightanglefor it is in a semicircle Prop 331the square on LM is thus double the square on LE Prop 147 Again since AC is equal to CB AB is double BC And as AB is to BC so the square on AB is to the square on BD Prop 68 Def 59 Thus the square on AB is double the square on BD And the square on LM was also shown to be double the square on LE And the square on DB is equal to the square on LE For EH was made equal to DB Thus the square on AB is also equal to the square on LM Thus AB is equal to LM And AB is the diameter of the given sphere Thus LM is equal to the diameter of the given sphere Thus the octahedron has been enclosed by the given sphere and it has been simultaneously proved that the square on the diameter of the sphere is double the square on the side of the octahedron Which is the very thing it was required to show If the radius of the sphere is unity then the side of octahedron is 2 ie Proposition 15 To construct a cube and to enclose it in a sphere like in the case of the pyramid and to show that the square on the diameter of the sphere is three times the square on the side of the cube Let the diameter AB of the given sphere be laid out and let it have been cut at C such that AC is double CB And let the semicircle ADB have been drawn on AB And let CD have been drawn from C at right angles to AB And let DB have been joined And let the square EFGH having its side equal to DB be laid out And let EK FL GM and HN have been drawn from points E F G and H respectively at rightangles to the plane of square EFGH And let EK FL GM and HN equal to one of EF FG GH and HE have been cut off from EK FL GM and HN respectively And let KL LM MN and NK have been joined Thus a cube contained by six equal squares has been constructed So it is also necessary to enclose it by the given sphere and to show that the square on the diameter of the sphere is three times the square on the side of the cube 525STOIQEIWN ig ELEMENTS BOOK 13 K G A B L M D H Z E N J H A B L M D F G C K E N For let KG and EG have been joined And since an gle KEG is a rightangleon account of KE also being at rightangles to the plane EG and manifestly also to the straightline EG Def 113the semicircle drawn on KG will thus also pass through point E Again since GF is at rightangles to each of FL and FE GF is thus also at rightangles to the plane FK Prop 114 Hence if we also join FK then GF will also be at rightangles to FK And again on account of this the semicircle drawn on GK will also pass through point F Similarly it will also pass through the remaining angular points of the cube So if KG remains xed and the semicircle is carried around and again established at the same posi tion from which it began to be moved then the cube will have been enclosed by a sphere So I say that it is also enclosed by the given sphere For since GF is equal to FE and the angle at F is a rightangle the square on EG is thus double the square on EF Prop 147 And EF is equal to EK Thus the square on EG is double the square on EK Hence the sum of the squares on GE and EKthat is to say the square on GK Prop 147is three times the square on EK And since AB is three times BC and as AB is to BC so the square on AB is to the square on BD Prop 68 Def 59 the square on AB is thus three times the square on BD And the square on GK was also shown to be three times the square on KE And KE was made equal to DB Thus KG is also equal to AB And AB is the radius of the given sphere Thus KG is also equal to the diameter of the given sphere Thus the cube has been enclosed by the given sphere And it has simultaneously been shown that the square on the diameter of the sphere is three times the square on 526STOIQEIWN ig ELEMENTS BOOK 13 the side of the cube Which is the very thing it was required to show If the radius of the sphere is unity then the side of the cube is p 43 i Proposition 16 To construct an icosahedron and to enclose it in a sphere like the aforementioned gures and to show that the side of the icosahedron is that irrational straight line called minor D A G B C A B D Let the diameter AB of the given sphere be laid out and let it have been cut at C such that AC is four times CB Prop 610 And let the semicircle ADB have been drawn on AB And let the straightline CD have been drawn from C at rightangles to AB And let DB have been joined And let the circle EFGHK be set down and let its radius be equal to DB And let the equilat eral and equiangular pentagon EFGHK have been in scribed in circle EFGHK Prop 411 And let the cir cumferences EF FG GH HK and KE have been cut in half at points L M N O and P respectively And let LM MN NO OP PL and EP have been joined Thus pentagon LMNOP is also equilateral and EP is the side of the decagon inscribed in the circle And let the straightlines EQ FR GS HT and KU which are equal to the radius of circle EFGHK have been set up at rightangles to the plane of the circle at points E F G H and K respectively And let QR RS ST T U UQ QL LR RM MS SN NT T O OU UP and PQ have been joined And since EQ and KU are each at rightangles to the same plane EQ is thus parallel to KU Prop 116 And it is also equal to it And straightlines joining equal and parallel straightlines on the same side are themselves equal and parallel Prop 133 Thus QU is equal and parallel to EK And EK is the side of an equilateral pentagon inscribed in circle EFGHK Thus QU is also the side of an equilateral pentagon inscribed in circle EFGHK So for the same reasons QR RS ST and T U are also the sides of an equilateral pentagon inscribed in circle EFGHK Pentagon QRST U is thus equilat 527STOIQEIWN ig ELEMENTS BOOK 13 eral And side QE is the side of a hexagon inscribed in circle EFGHK and EP the side of a decagon and angle QEP is a rightangle thus QP is the side of a pentagon inscribed in the same circle For the square on the side of a pentagon is equal to the sum of the squares on the sides of a hexagon and a decagon in scribed in the same circle Prop 1310 So for the same reasons PU is also the side of a pentagon And QU is also the side of a pentagon Thus triangle QPU is equilateral So for the same reasons triangles QLR RMS SNT and T OU are each also equilateral And since QL and QP were each shown to be the sides of a pentagon and LP is also the side of a pentagon trian gle QLP is thus equilateral So for the same reasons triangles LRM MSN NT O and OUP are each also equilateral a P S Z R T N U X O E M K J H L Q W F Y a S T N U E K L F G O Q H Z W P R M X V Let the center point V of circle EFGHK have been found Prop 31 And let V Z have been set up at point V at rightangles to the plane of the circle And let it have been produced on the other side of the cir cle like V X And let V W have been cut off from XZ so as to be equal to the side of a hexagon and each of V X and WZ so as to be equal to the side of a decagon And let QZ QW UZ EV LV LX and XM have been joined And since V W and QE are each at rightangles to the plane of the circle V W is thus parallel to QE Prop 116 And they are also equal EV and QW are thus equal and parallel to one another Prop 133 528STOIQEIWN ig ELEMENTS BOOK 13 And EV is the side of a hexagon Thus QW is also the side of a hexagon And since QW is the side of a hexagon and WZ the side of a decagon and angle QWZ is a rightangle Def 113 Prop 129 QZ is thus the side of a pentagon Prop 1310 So for the same reasons UZ is also the side of a pentagoninasmuch as if we join V K and WU then they will be equal and opposite And V K being equal to the radius of the cir cle is the side of a hexagon Prop 415 corr Thus WU is also the side of a hexagon And WZ is the side of a decagon and angle UWZ is a rightangle Thus UZ is the side of a pentagon Prop 1310 And QU is also the side of a pentagon Triangle QUZ is thus equilateral So for the same reasons each of the re maining triangles whose bases are the straightlines QR RS ST and T U and apexes the point Z are also equi lateral Again since V L is the side of a hexagon and V X the side of a decagon and angle LV X is a right angle LX is thus the side of a pentagon Prop 1310 So for the same reasons if we join MV which is the side of a hexagon MX is also inferred to be the side of a pentagon And LM is also the side of a pentagon Thus triangle LMX is equilateral So similarly it can be shown that each of the remaining triangles whose bases are the straightlines MN NO OP and PL and apexes the point X are also equilateral Thus an icosahedron contained by twenty equilateral triangles has been constructed So it is also necessary to enclose it in the given sphere and to show that the side of the icosahedron is that irrational straightline called minor For since V W is the side of a hexagon and WZ the side of a decagon V Z has thus been cut in ex treme and mean ratio at W and V W is its greater piece Prop 139 Thus as ZV is to V W so V W is to WZ And V W is equal to V E and WZ to V X Thus as ZV is to V E so EV is to V X And angles ZV E and EV X are rightangles Thus if we join straightline EZ then angle XEZ will be a rightangle on account of the similarity of triangles XEZ and V EZ Prop 68 So for the same reasons since as ZV is to V W so V W is to WZ and ZV is equal to XW and V W to WQ thus as XW is to WQ so QW is to WZ And again on account of this if we join QX then the angle at Q will be a rightangle Prop 68 Thus the semicircle drawn on XZ will also pass through Q Prop 331 And if XZ remains xed and the semicircle is carried around and again established at the same position from which it began to be moved then it will also pass through point Q and through the remaining angular points of the icosahedron And the icosahedron will have been en 529STOIQEIWN ig ELEMENTS BOOK 13 closed by a sphere So I say that it is also enclosed by the given sphere For let V W have been cut in half at a And since the straightline V Z has been cut in ex treme and mean ratio at W and ZW is its lesser piece then the square on ZW added to half of the greater piece Wa is ve times the square on half of the greater piece Prop 133 Thus the square on Za is ve times the square on aW And ZX is double Za and V W double aW Thus the square on ZX is ve times the square on WV And since AC is four times CB AB is thus ve times BC And as AB is to BC so the square on AB is to the square on BD Prop 68 Def 59 Thus the square on AB is ve times the square on BD And the square on ZX was also shown to be ve times the square on V W And DB is equal to V W For each of them is equal to the radius of circle EFGHK Thus AB is also equal to XZ And AB is the diameter of the given sphere Thus XZ is equal to the diameter of the given sphere Thus the icosahedron has been en closed by the given sphere So I say that the side of the icosahedron is that irra tional straightline called minor For since the diameter of the sphere is rational and the square on it is ve times the square on the radius of circle EFGHK the radius of circle EFGHK is thus also rational Hence its di ameter is also rational And if an equilateral pentagon is inscribed in a circle having a rational diameter then the side of the pentagon is that irrational straightline called minor Prop 1311 And the side of pentagon EFGHK is the side of the icosahedron Thus the side of the icosahedron is that irrational straightline called minor Pri sma Corollary So it is clear from this that the square on the di ameter of the sphere is ve times the square on the ra dius of the circle from which the icosahedron has been described and that the the diameter of the sphere is the sum of the side of the hexagon and two of the sides of the decagon inscribed in the same circle If the radius of the sphere is unity then the radius of the circle is 2 5 and the sides of the hexagon decagon and pentagonicosahedron are 2 5 1 1 5 and 1 5 p 10 2 5 respectively iz Proposition 17 To construct a dodecahedron and to enclose it in a sphere like the aforementioned gures and to show that the side of the dodecahedron is that irrational straight line called an apotome 530STOIQEIWN ig ELEMENTS BOOK 13 T L P K G N E M Z A R B S F X H J U D Q W Y O T L K N E M A D G F O C B H S R Q U V W Z P X Let two planes of the aforementioned cube Prop 1315 ABCD and CBEF which are at rightangles to one another be laid out And let the sides AB BC CD DA EF EB and FC have each been cut in half at points G H K L M N and O respectively And let GK HL MH and NO have been joined And let NP PO and HQ have each been cut in extreme and mean ratio at points R S and T respectively And let their greater pieces be RP PS and T Q respectively And let RU SV and T W have been set up on the exterior side of the cube at points R S and T respectively at rightangles to the planes of the cube And let them be made equal to RP PS and T Q And let UB BW WC CV and V U have been joined I say that the pentagon UBWCV is equilateral and in one plane and further equiangular For let RB SB and V B have been joined And since the straightline NP has been cut in extreme and mean ratio at R and RP is the greater piece the sum of the squares on PN and NR is thus three times the square on RP Prop 134 And PN is equal to NB and PR to RU Thus the sum of the squares on BN and NR is three times the square on RU And the square on BR is equal to the sum of the squares on BN and NR Prop 147 Thus the square on BR is three times the square on RU Hence the sum of the squares on BR and RU is four times the square on RU And the square on BU is equal to the sum of the squares on BR and RU Prop 147 Thus the square on BU is four times the square on UR Thus BU is double RU And V U is also double UR inasmuch as SR is also double PRthat is to say RU Thus BU is equal to UV So similarly it can be shown that each of BW WC CV is equal to each 531STOIQEIWN ig ELEMENTS BOOK 13 of BU and UV Thus pentagon BUV CW is equilateral So I say that it is also in one plane For let PX have been drawn from P parallel to each of RU and SV on the exterior side of the cube And let XH and HW have been joined I say that XHW is a straightline For since HQ has been cut in extreme and mean ratio at T and QT is its greater piece thus as HQ is to QT so QT is to T H And HQ is equal to HP and QT to each of T W and PX Thus as HP is to PX so WT is to T H And HP is parallel to T W For of each of them is at rightangles to the plane BD Prop 116 And T H is parallel to PX For each of them is at rightangles to the plane BF Prop 116 And if two triangles like XPH and HT W having two sides proportional to two sides are placed together at a single angle such that their corresponding sides are also parallel then the remaining sides will be straighton to one another Prop 632 Thus XH is straighton to HW And every straightline is in one plane Prop 111 Thus pentagon UBWCV is in one plane So I say that it is also equiangular For since the straightline NP has been cut in extreme and mean ratio at R and PR is the greater piece thus as the sum of NP and PR is to PN so NP is to PR and PR is equal to PS thus as SN is to NP so NP is to PS NS has thus also been cut in extreme and mean ratio at P and NP is the greater piece Prop 135 Thus the sum of the squares on NS and SP is three times the square on NP Prop 134 And NP is equal to NB and PS to SV Thus the sum of the squares on NS and SV is three times the square on NB Hence the sum of the squares on V S SN and NB is four times the square on NB And the square on SB is equal to the sum of the squares on SN and NB Prop 147 Thus the sum of the squares on BS and SV that is to say the square on BV for angle V SB is a rightangleis four times the square on NB Def 113 Prop 147 Thus V B is double BN And BC is also double BN Thus BV is equal to BC And since the two straightlines BU and UV are equal to the two straightlines BW and WC respectively and the base BV is equal to the base BC angle BUV is thus equal to angle BWC Prop 18 So similarly we can show that angle UV C is equal to angle BWC Thus the three angles BWC BUV and UV C are equal to one another And if three angles of an equilateral pentagon are equal to one another then the pentagon is equiangu lar Prop 137 Thus pentagon BUV CW is equiangu lar And it was also shown to be equilateral Thus pen tagon BUV CW is equilateral and equiangular and it is on one of the sides BC of the cube Thus if we make the 532STOIQEIWN ig ELEMENTS BOOK 13 same construction on each of the twelve sides of the cube then some solid gure contained by twelve equilateral and equiangular pentagons will have been constructed which is called a dodecahedron So it is necessary to enclose it in the given sphere and to show that the side of the dodecahedron is that irrational straightline called an apotome For let XP have been produced and let the produced straightline be XZ Thus PZ meets the diameter of the cube and they cut one another in half For this has been proved in the penultimate theorem of the eleventh book Prop 1138 Let them cut one another at Z Thus Z is the center of the sphere enclosing the cube and ZP is half the side of the cube So let UZ have been joined And since the straightline NS has been cut in extreme and mean ratio at P and its greater piece is NP the sum of the squares on NS and SP is thus three times the square on NP Prop 134 And NS is equal to XZ inasmuch as NP is also equal to PZ and XP to PS But indeed PS is also equal to XU since it is also equal to RP Thus the sum of the squares on ZX and XU is three times the square on NP And the square on UZ is equal to the sum of the squares on ZX and XU Prop 147 Thus the square on UZ is three times the square on NP And the square on the radius of the sphere enclosing the cube is also three times the square on half the side of the cube For it has previously been demonstrated how to construct the cube and to enclose it in a sphere and to show that the square on the diameter of the sphere is three times the square on the side of the cube Prop 1315 And if the square on the whole is three times the square on the whole then the square on the half is also three times the square on the half And NP is half of the side of the cube Thus UZ is equal to the radius of the sphere enclosing the cube And Z is the center of the sphere enclosing the cube Thus point U is on the surface of the sphere So similarly we can show that each of the remaining angles of the dodecahedron is also on the surface of the sphere Thus the dodecahedron has been enclosed by the given sphere So I say that the side of the dodecahedron is that irrational straightline called an apotome For since RP is the greater piece of NP which has been cut in extreme and mean ratio and PS is the greater piece of PO which has been cut in extreme and mean ratio RS is thus the greater piece of the whole of NO which has been cut in extreme and mean ratio Thus since as NP is to PR so PR is to RN and the same is also true of the doubles For parts have the same ratio as similar multiples taken in corresponding 533STOIQEIWN ig ELEMENTS BOOK 13 order Prop 515 Thus as NO is to RS so RS is to the sum of NR and SO And NO is greater than RS Thus RS is also greater than the sum of NR and SO Prop 514 Thus NO has been cut in extreme and mean ratio and RS is its greater piece And RS is equal to UV Thus UV is the greater piece of NO which has been cut in extreme and mean ratio And since the diameter of the sphere is rational and the square on it is three times the square on the side of the cube NO which is the side of the cube is thus rational And if a rational straightline is cut in extreme and mean ra tio then each of the pieces is the irrational straightline called an apotome Thus UV which is the side of the dodecahedron is the irrational straightline called an apotome Prop 136 Pri sma Corollary So it is clear from this that the side of the dodeca hedron is the greater piece of the side of the cube when it is cut in extreme and mean ratio Which is the very thing it was required to show If the radius of the circumscribed sphere is unity then the side of the cube is p 43 and the side of the dodecahedron is 13 15 3 ih Proposition 18 To set out the sides of the ve aforementioned g ures and to compare them with one another N A G E Z M D L B K H J N A E M D L B C F G K H Let the diameter AB of the given sphere be laid out And let it have been cut at C such that AC is equal to CB and at D such that AD is double DB And let the semicircle AEB have been drawn on AB And let CE and DF have been drawn from C and D respectively at rightangles to AB And let AF FB and EB have been joined And since AD is double DB AB is thus triple BD Thus via conversion BA is one and a half 534STOIQEIWN ig ELEMENTS BOOK 13 times AD And as BA is to AD so the square on BA is to the square on AF Def 59 For triangle AFB is equiangular to triangle AFD Prop 68 Thus the square on BA is one and a half times the square on AF And the square on the diameter of the sphere is also one and a half times the square on the side of the pyramid Prop 1313 And AB is the diameter of the sphere Thus AF is equal to the side of the pyramid Again since AD is double DB AB is thus triple BD And as AB is to BD so the square on AB is to the square on BF Prop 68 Def 59 Thus the square on AB is three times the square on BF And the square on the diameter of the sphere is also three times the square on the side of the cube Prop 1315 And AB is the diameter of the sphere Thus BF is the side of the cube And since AC is equal to CB AB is thus double BC And as AB is to BC so the square on AB is to the square on BE Prop 68 Def 59 Thus the square on AB is double the square on BE And the square on the diameter of the sphere is also double the square on the side of the octagon Prop 1314 And AB is the diameter of the given sphere Thus BE is the side of the octagon So let AG have been drawn from point A at right angles to the straightline AB And let AG be made equal to AB And let GC have been joined And let HK have been drawn from H perpendicular to AB And since GA is double AC For GA is equal to AB And as GA is to AC so HK is to KC Prop 64 HK is thus also double KC Thus the square on HK is four times the square on KC Thus the sum of the squares on HK and KC which is the square on HC Prop 147 is ve times the square on KC And HC is equal to CB Thus the square on BC is ve times the square on CK And since AB is double CB of which AD is double DB the remainder BD is thus double the remainder DC BC is thus triple CD The square on BC is thus nine times the square on CD And the square on BC is ve times the square on CK Thus the square on CK is greater than the square on CD CK is thus greater than CD Let CL be made equal to CK And let LM have been drawn from L at rightangles to AB And let MB have been joined And since the square on BC is ve times the square on CK and AB is double BC and KL double CK the square on AB is thus ve times the square on KL And the square on the diam eter of the sphere is also ve times the square on the radius of the circle from which the icosahedron has been described Prop 1316 corr And AB is the diameter of the sphere Thus KL is the radius of the circle from 535STOIQEIWN ig ELEMENTS BOOK 13 which the icosahedron has been described Thus KL is the side of the hexagon inscribed in the aforemen tioned circle Prop 415 corr And since the diameter of the sphere is composed of the side of the hexagon and two of the sides of the decagon inscribed in the afore mentioned circle and AB is the diameter of the sphere and KL the side of the hexagon and AK is equal to LB thus AK and LB are each sides of the decagon in scribed in the circle from which the icosahedron has been described And since LB is the side of the decagon And ML is the side of the hexagonfor it is equal to KL since it is also equal to HK for they are equally far from the center And HK and KL are each double KC MB is thus the side of the pentagon inscribed in the circle Props 1310 147 And the side of the pentagon is the side of the icosahedron Prop 1316 Thus MB is the side of the icosahedron And since FB is the side of the cube let it have been cut in extreme and mean ratio at N and let NB be the greater piece Thus NB is the side of the dodecahedron Prop 1317 corr And since the square on the diameter of the sphere was shown to be one and a half times the square on the side AF of the pyramid and twice the square on the side BE of the octagon and three times the square on the side FB of the cube thus of whatever parts the square on the diameter of the sphere makes six of such parts the square on the side of the pyramid makes four and the square on the side of the oc tagon three and the square on the side of the cube two Thus the square on the side of the pyramid is one and a third times the square on the side of the octagon and double the square on the side of the cube And the square on the side of the octahedron is one and a half times the square on the side of the cube Therefore the aforementioned sides of the three guresI mean of the pyramid and of the octahedron and of the cube are in rational ratios to one another And the sides of the remaining two guresI mean of the icosahe dron and of the dodecahedronare neither in rational ratios to one another nor to the sides of the aforemen tioned three gures For they are irrational straight lines namely a minor Prop 1316 and an apotome Prop 1317 And we can show that the side MB of the icosahe dron is greater that the side NB or the dodecahedron as follows For since triangle FDB is equiangular to triangle FAB Prop 68 proportionally as DB is to BF so BF is to BA Prop 64 And since three straightlines are continually proportional as the rst is to the third 536STOIQEIWN ig ELEMENTS BOOK 13 so the square on the rst is to the square on the second Def 59 Prop 620 corr Thus as DB is to BA so the square on DB is to the square on BF Thus inversely as AB is to BD so the square on FB is to the square on BD And AB is triple BD Thus the square on FB is three times the square on BD And the square on AD is also four times the square on DB For AD is double DB Thus the square on AD is greater than the square on FB Thus AD is greater than FB Thus AL is much greater than FB And KL is the greater piece of AL which is cut in extreme and mean ratioinasmuch as LK is the side of the hexagon and KA the side of the decagon Prop 139 And NB is the greater piece of FB which is cut in extreme and mean ratio Thus KL is greater than NB And KL is equal to LM Thus LM is greater than NB and MB is greater than LM Thus MB which is the side of the icosahedron is much greater than NB which is the side of the dodecahe dron Which is the very thing it was required to show If the radius of the given sphere is unity then the sides of the pyramid ie tetrahedron octahedron cube icosahedron and dodecahedron respectively satisfy the following inequality p 83 2 p 43 1 5 p 10 2 5 13 15 3 So I say that beside the ve aforementioned gures no other solid gure can be constructed which is con tained by equilateral and equiangular planes equal to one another For a solid angle cannot be constructed from two tri angles or indeed two planes of any sort Def 1111 And the solid angle of the pyramid is constructed from three equiangular triangles and that of the oc tahedron from four triangles and that of the icosahe dron from ve triangles And a solid angle cannot be made from six equilateral and equiangular triangles set up together at one point For since the angles of a equi lateral triangle are each twothirds of a rightangle the sum of the six plane angles containing the solid an gle will be four rightangles The very thing is impos sible For every solid angle is contained by plane angles whose sum is less than four rightangles Prop 1121 So for the same reasons a solid angle cannot be con structed from more than six plane angles equal to two thirds of a rightangle either And the solid angle of a cube is contained by three squares And a solid angle contained by four squares is impossible For again the sum of the plane angles containing the solid angle will be four rightangles And the solid angle of a dodec ahedron is contained by three equilateral and equian gular pentagons And a solid angle contained by four 537STOIQEIWN ig ELEMENTS BOOK 13 equiangular pentagons is impossible For the angle of an equilateral pentagon being one and onefth of right angle four such angles will be greater in sum than four rightangles The very thing is impossible And on account of the same absurdity a solid angle cannot be constructed from any other equiangular polygonal gures either Thus beside the ve aforementioned gures no other solid gure can be constructed which is contained by equilateral and equiangular planes Which is the very thing it was required to show Z D A E B G C D A E B F Lmma Lemma It can be shown that the angle of an equilateral and equiangular pentagon is one and onefth of a right angle as follows For let ABCDE be an equilateral and equiangular pentagon and let the circle ABCDE have been circum scribed about it Prop 414 And let its center F have been found Prop 31 And let FA FB FC FD and FE have been joined Thus they cut the angles of the pentagon in half at points A B C D and E Prop 14 And since the ve angles at F are equal in sum to four rightangles and are also equal to one an other any one of them like AFB is thus one less a fth of a rightangle Thus the sum of the remaining angles in triangle ABF FAB and ABF is one plus a fth of a rightangle Prop 132 And FAB is equal to FBC Thus the whole angle ABC of the pentagon is also one and onefth of a rightangle Which is the very thing it was required to show 538GREEKENGLISH LEXICON 539STOIQEIWN
