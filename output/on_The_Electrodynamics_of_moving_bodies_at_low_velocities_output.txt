modern implica tions We use their results to point out some confusion in the literature and in the teaching of special relativity and electromagnetism For instance it is not widely recognized that there exist two well dened nonrelativistic limits so that researchers and teachers are likely to utilize an incoherent mixture of both Recent works have shed a new light on the choice of gauge conditions in classical electromagnetism We retrieve Le BellacLevyLeblonds results by examining orders of magnitudes and then with a Lorentzlike manifestly co variant approach to Galilean covariance based on a 5dimensional Minkowski manifold We emphasize the RiemannLorenz approach based on the vector and scalar potentials as opposed to the HeavisideHertz formulation in terms of elec tromagnetic elds We discuss various applications and experiments such as in magnetohydrodynamics and electrohydrodynamics quantum mechanics su perconductivity continuous media etc Much of the current technology where waves are not taken into account is actually based on Galilean electromag netism Key words Galilean covariance special relativity electromagnetism fourpotential 1Email montignyphysualbertaca GermainRousseauxinlncnrsfr1 Introduction The purpose of this article is to emphasize the relevance of Galilean covariance in physics even nowadays about one hundred years after Lorentz Poincare and Ein stein then facing the apparent incompatibility between Galilean mechanics and the full set of Maxwell equations have developed a theory that turned into special rel ativity 2 Seventy years later Le Bellac and LevyLeblond LBLL observed that there exist not only one but two welldened Galilean that is nonrelativistic limits of electromagnetism the socalled magnetic and electric limits 1 Although spe cial relativity has superseded Galilean relativity when it comes to the description of high energy phenomena there exists a wealth of lowenergy systems particularly in condensed matter physics and lowenergy nuclear physics where Galilean covariance should not be ignored We wish to point out hereafter some confusion which results from not recognizing appropriately the two Galilean limits of electromagnetism This follows from inacu rate denitions of nonrelativistic covariance which is why we emphasize at once that the denition of Galilean covariance employed henceforth in this paper rests on its compatibility with the Galilean transformations of spacetime Eq 6 below Ex amples of misleading though well known such text presentations are mentioned in 1 and there were many more since then The fact that one should be careful when dealing with electrodynamics at low velocities has been illustrated for instance in Ref 3 Let us illustrate this point with a simple example Under a Lorentz transfor mation with relative velocity v the electric and magnetic elds in vacuum become E E v B 1 vvE v2 B B 1 c2v E 1 vvB v2 1 respectively The fact that Galilean covariance is a much more subtle concept than simply taking the v c or 1 limit is illustrated by the fact that Eq 1 then becomes E E v B B B 1 c2v E 2 which not only is not compatible with Galilean relativity but worse does not even satisfy the composition properties of transformation groups 1 3 That is to say a sequence of such transformations does not have the same form as above We have organized this article as follows In Section 2 we recall the main results of LBLL 1 for later reference In Section 3 we obtain these results using two ar guments one based on orders of magnitudes and a recent covariant approach with which the Galilean spacetime is embedded into a vedimensional space Throughout the paper we favour the RiemannLorenz formulation of electrodynamics based on the scalar and vector potentials over the HeavisideHertz approach which involved electromagnetic elds 4 Discussion and applications are in Section 4 Therein we present magnetohydrodynamics and electrohydrodynamics as two notsodistant 1cousins which can be associated respectively with the magnetic and electric Galilean limits of electrodynamics We show that engineers are used to employ these Galilean limits which they denote as the electro and magnetoquasistatics We revisited Feyn mans proof of the magnetic limit and illustrate the latter within the realm of super conductivity Finally we reassess our current understanding of the electrodynamics of moving bodies by examining the TroutonNoble experiment in a Galilean context 2 Galilean electromagnetism The purpose of LBLL was to write down the laws of electromagnetism in a form compatible with Galilean covariance rather than Lorentz covariance As LBLL put it such laws could have been devised by a physicist in the midnineteenth century 1 Here let us retrieve these laws from relativistic kinematics The Lorentz trans formation of a fourvector u0 u where the four components have the same units is given by see chapter 7 of Ref 5 u0 u0 1 cv u u u v c u0 1 v v2v u 3 where 1 1v2c2 with a relative velocity v The speed of light in the vacuum is denoted c LBLL were the rst to observe that this transformation admits two welldened Galilean limits 1 One limit is for timelike vectors u0 u0 u u 1 cvu0 4 which as we shall see may be related to the socalled electric limit The second limit is for spacelike vectors u0 u0 1 cv u u u 5 and will be associated to the magnetic limit As it is well known the spacetime coordinates can be described by timelike vectors only Indeed Eq 4 has the form of Galilean inertial spacetime transformations x x vt t t 6 Nevertheless other vectors such as the fourpotential and fourcurrent may trans form as one or the other of the two limits An example of the subtlety of nonrelativistic kinematical covariance is that it is quite common to neglect to enforce the condition that a nonrelativistic limit involves not only lowvelocity phenomena but also large timelike intervals then one obtains dierent kinematics referred to as Carroll kinematics 6 In other terms a Galilean 2world is one within which units of time are naturally much larger than units of space The existence of events physically connected by large spacelike intervals would imply loss of causality among other things Other such kinematics each one being some limit of the de Sitter kinematics have been classied in 7 The situation is similar with electric and magnetic elds One needs to compare the module of the electric eld E to c times the module of the magnetic eld ie cB When the magnetic eld is dominant Eq 1 reduces to a transformation referred to as the magnetic limit of electromagnetism E m Em v Bm Em cBm B m Bm 7 The other alternative where the electric eld is dominant leads to the electric limit E e Ee Ee cBe B e Be 1 c2v Ee 8 Indeed the approximations Eec Be and v c together imply that Eev Eec Be so that we take Ee vBe in Eq 1 Such an analysis of orders of magnitude is described in the next section From the Galilean transformations of spacetime Eq 6 we nd t t v 9 The elds transformations in the magnetic limit of Eq 7 are clearly compatible with the use of Eq 9 together with the transformations of the fourpotential V A V m Vm v Am A m Am 10 note the similarity with Eq 5 where Em Vm tAm Bm Am 11 Similarly the electric limit of Eq 8 may be obtained from Eq 9 and the trans formations of the fourpotential V e Ve A e Ae v c2Ve 12 This equation is similar to Eq 4 Now however the elds are related to the fourpotential by Ee Ve Be Ae 13 In parallel with the two possible sets of transformations of the fourpotential there are two ways to transform the fourcurrent j In the magnetic limit it transforms like Eq 5 m m 1 c2v jm j m jm 14 3and the continuity equation then reads jm 0 15 The appearance of an eective charge density m m 1 c2v jm is certainly one of the salient feature of the magnetic limit We will refer the interested reader to the following works which discussed the eect of this eective charge without pointing out its Galilean origin for most of them 8 For the electric limit it transforms like Eq 4 e e j e je ve 16 and the continuity equation has its usual form je te 0 17 Finally Maxwells equations E tB Faraday B 0 Thomson B 0j 1 c2tE Ampere E 1 0 Gauss 18 reduce in the Galilean limits to two respective forms As the eld transformation laws themselves this fact is not so obvious if one naively takes the limit c In the next section we present an argument based on dimensional analysis and orders of magnitude In Ref 1 it was found that in the electric limit the Maxwell equations reduce to Ee 0 Be 0 Be 1 c2tEe 0je Ee 1 0e 19 Clearly the main dierence with the relativistic Maxwell equations is that here the electric eld has zero curl in Faradays law In the magnetic limit the Maxwell equations become Em tBm Bm 0 Bm 0jm Em 1 0m 20 The displacement current term is absent in Amperes law 43 Recent analyses 31 Orders of magnitude Many errors occur within lowvelocity limits of relativistic theories when one naively replaces some quantities with zero rather than carefully comparing various orders of magnitudes involved in the equations As we shall show herafter we do not require fanciful mathematical tools to retrieve the two Galilean limits of electromagnetism of LBLL As discussed by one of us in Ref 9 a careful dimensional analysis of the elds equations is sucient for this purpose Therein it is argued that the electric and magnetic limits may be retrieved by a careful consideration of the order of magnitude of the dimensionless parameters L cT and j c 21 where L T j and represent the orders of magnitude of length time current den sity and charge density respectively The Galilean kinematics considered hereafter corresponds to the quasistatic limit 1 The other extreme 1 leads to the socalled Carroll kinematics 6 The main undesirable feature of this kinematical structure is the loss of causality The electric or magnetic character of the Galilean limits of electromagnetism is determined by the behavior of the parameter From Gausss law and Amperes law Eq 18 we nd cB E j c so that cB E Using this result and Eqs 7 8 we nd 1 magnetic limit 1 electric limit 22 Returning to Eq 21 we see that the magnetic limit correspond to the approxima tion j c that is the spacelike component is larger than the timelike component This echoes the transformation in Eq 5 Conversely the electric limit correspond to the approximation c j so that the spacelike component now is much larger than the timelike component This is analogue to Eq 4 From Maxwell displacement current term in the Amperes law Eq 18 we nd B vE c2 23 where v denotes the ratio of orders of magnitude LT Similarly the magnetic in duction term of Faradays law gives E vB 24 5If we substitute this result into Eq 23 we nd that the displacement current term and the full Faradays law are compatible only if v c that is in the Lorentz covariant regime However Eq 23 cannot be obtained if we drop tE from Amperes law so that it is compatible with the rst and third lines of Eq 19 ie in the electric limit On the other hand Eq 24 is compatible with lines one and three of Eq 20 ie the magnetic limit because it does not appear if we drop the magnetic induction term tB of Faradays law in line three of Eq 18 Following the lines of Ref 1014 we use the RiemannLorenz formulation of electromagnetism which relies on the potentials as the basic quantities in order to retrieve the two Galilean limits This is in opposition to the HeavisideHertz formulation which is based on the magnetic and electric elds 1012 In terms of potentials the equations of classical electromagnetism read 2V 1 c2 2V t2 0 Riemann equations 2A 1 c2 2A t2 0j 25 A 1 c2 V t 0 Lorenz equation 26 d dtmv qA qV v A Lorentz force 27 They can be obtained from the Fermi Lagrangian 15 LF 1 20c2AA 28 We consider the full Lagrangian consisting of a eld and a matter part that is L LF LM The EulerLagrange equation L A L A 0 29 leads to the following equations of motion using Eq 26 A 0 A 0j 30 with 0j LMA 31 The quasistatic approximation 1 of Eq 25 reads 2V 0 and 2A 0j 32 from which we can dene a further dimensionless ratio cA V j c so that cA V 33 6Once again this echoes our comment following Eq 22 in the magnetic limit the spacelike quantity cA is dominant whereas in the electric limit it is the timelike quantity V which dominates If we compare the two terms of the Lorenz not Lorentz 13 gauge condition Eq 26 we nd A tVc2 cT L cA V 34 In the quasistatic regime 1 we nd therefore two possibilities If 1 like then we are in the electric limit and the gauge condition is similar to the Lorenz condition Ae 1 c2tVe 0 35 On the other hand in the magnetic limit 1 then we drop tV so that we obtain the Coulomb gauge condition Am 0 36 Let us use the orders of magnitude for the fourpotential components and obtain thereof their Galilean transformations in the magnetic limit Eq 10 and the electric limit Eq 12 From Eq 3 with u0 Vc and u A we nd that the scalar potential V and the vector potential A transform under a Lorentz transformation as V V v A A A v c2V 1 v v2v A 37 From the rst line of this equation we have V vA so that we obtain from Eq 33 cA V cA vA 1 Therefore in the quasistatic limit 1 this equation gives 1 so that the rst line is compatible with the magnetic limit Accordingly this is incompatible with the electric limit for which 1 so that the term v A must be dropped from the rst line of Eq 37 in the electric limit A similar argument applied to the second line of Eq 37 implies A vV c2 so that cA V cvV c2V v c Unlike the previous case the quasistatic limit leads to 1 which is compatible with the electric limit only Eq 12 This implies that in the magnetic limit the term v c2V must be dropped from the second line of Eq 37 as it is the case in Eq 10 If we use an entirely similar analysis for the Lorentz transformation of charge and current densities obtained from Eq 3 with u0 and u jc 1 c2v j j j v 1 v v2v j 38 7we retrieve the Galilean transformations Eqs 14 and 16 for the magnetic and electric limits respectively Let us conclude by briey discussing the continuity equation j t 0 If we compare the two terms as we have done for the Lorentz gauge condition in Eq 34 we nd j t cT L j c If 1 like in the quasistatic regime 1 then we obtain the electric limit and we retrieve Eq 17 On the other hand in the magnetic case 1 so that we drop t and obtain thereby Eq 15 32 Reduction from 4 1 Minkowski spacetime Hereafter we review briey a dierent approach to the Galilean gauge elds 16 It involves a formulation of Galilean invariance based on a reduction from a ve dimensional Minkowski manifold to the Newtonian spacetime 1719 The extended space is such that a Galilean boost with relative velocity v v1 v2 v3 acts on a Galileivector x t s as x x vt t t s s v x 1 2v2t 39 Since s tranforms like the mass m see below for a justication one can see the additional coordinate s as being conjugate to the mass m since both are invariant under Galilean transformations s may be seen also as the action per unit mass More about classical and quantum physical interpretations of s is in Refs 1619 The scalar product AB AB A B A4B5 A5B4 of two Galileivectors A and B is invariant under the transformation Eq 39 This suggests a method to base the tensor calculus on the metric g g 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 40 Hereafter we refer to this as the Galilean metric 8The transformation in Eq 39 can be written in matrix form for the components of any vevector as x x where denotes the row and the column so that is the entry or x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 1 0 0 v1 0 0 1 0 v2 0 0 0 1 v3 0 0 0 0 1 0 v1 v2 v3 1 2v2 1 x1 x2 x3 x4 x5 For a veoneform this transformation reads x x where now denotes the column and the row that is is the entry or x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 x1 x2 x3 x4 x5 1 0 0 v1 0 0 1 0 v2 0 0 0 1 v3 0 0 0 0 1 0 v1 v2 v3 1 2v2 1 41 We write the embedding as x t x x t s as well as the following vemomentum p i i it is so that with the usual identication E it and with m is we obtain p p E m p gp p m E Thereupon the mass does not enter as an external parameter but as a remnant of the fth component of the particles momentum Hereafter the vemomentum operator will act on a massless eld so that 5A sA 0 Now let us set up the vedimensional quantities that allow us to retrieve the two Galilean limits of electromagnetism They are given by dening two embeddings of the vepotential A A A4 A5 9Under the transformation in Eq 39 its components transform from Eq 41 as A A vA5 A4 A4 v A 1 2v2A5 A5 A5 42 Next we write the vedimensional electromagnetic antisymmetric Faraday tensor F A A 0 b3 b2 c1 d1 b3 0 b1 c2 d2 b2 b1 0 c3 d3 c1 c2 c3 0 a d1 d2 d3 a 0 43 Thus we have b A c A4 4A d A5 5A a 4A5 5A4 44 The vecurrent j j j4 j5 transforms under the transformation Eq 39 as j j vj5 j4 j4 v j 1 2v2j5 j5 j5 45 The continuity equation takes the form j j 4j5 5j4 0 46 The vedimensional Lorenzlike condition takes a similar form A A 4A5 5A4 0 47 In the presence of sources the Maxwell equations are F F F 0 48 and F j 49 so that in terms of the components of F dened in Eq 43 we nd from Eq 48 b 0 c 4b 0 d 5b 0 a 4d 5c 0 50 10whereas Eq 49 reduces to b 5c 4d j c 4a j4 d 5a j5 51 From F F the entries of F in Eq 41 transform as a a v d b b vd c c vb 1 2v2d av vv d d d 52 Let us now see how the electric and magnetic limits are contained within the previous formulas 321 Electric limit As mentioned previously the electric limit is characterized by fourpotential and four current vectors which are timelike that is their time component is much larger than the length of their spatial components In the reduction approach it corresponds to dening the embedding of the potentials and currents as Ae Ve Ae Ae 0 00Ve 53 and je e je 0je 0 0e 54 respectively From Eqs 42 and 53 we retrieve Eq 12 Similarly we obtain Eq 16 from Eqs 45 and 54 As for the continuity equation Eq 46 it becomes Eq 17 From the rst line of Eq 44 we come to the natural denition Be b Ae The electric eld is dened as the component d so that from the third line of Eq 44 we have Ee 1 00d Ve as in Eq 13 From Eq 44 we note that c tAe and a 1 00tVe Then Eq 52 leads to Eq 8 The corresponding Maxwell equations Eq 19 are obtained from Eqs 50 and 51 Note that the second line of Eq 51 provides a condition similar to Lorenz gauge xing Ae 00tVe This expression may be obtained also by substituting Eq 53 into Eq 47 11322 Magnetic limit This nonrelativistic limit is characterized by spacelike fourpotential and fourcurrent vectors their time component is small compared to the length of their spatial com ponents Hereafter we show that it corresponds to dening the embedding of the potentials and currents as Am Vm Am Am Vm 0 55 and jm m jm 0jm 1 0 m 0 56 respectively From Eqs 42 and 55 we retrieve Eq 10 Similarly Eqs 45 and 56 lead to Eq 14 and the continuity equation 46 gives Eq 15 which shows that the current jm cannot be related to a convective transport of charge As above we dene the magnetic eld as Bm b Am and the electric eld is now dened as the component c so that from the second line of Eq 44 we obtain Em c Vm tAm as in Eq 11 Then Eq 52 leads to Eq 7 The Maxwell equations 20 are obtained from Eqs 50 and 51 Finally note that by replacing Eq 55 into Eq 47 we obtain Coulombs gauge condition Am 0 4 Discussion and examples 41 Gauge conditions and Galilean electromagnetism In this section we describe the two Galilean limits using the RiemannLorentz ap proach that is in terms of the scalar and vector potentials The denition E tA V of Eq 11 takes dierent forms in the Galilean limit depending on the order of magnitude of each term This is because the Galilean transformations for the potentials depend on whether we take the electric or magnetic limit Let us evaluate the order of magnitude of the ratio between its two terms tA V A T V L L cT cA V In the magnetic limit for which 1 this equation leads to Em Vm tAm as in Eq 11 By computing the curl we nd tBm Em as in the rst line of Eq 20 Likewise in the electric limit for which 1 we can neglect tA so that we nd Ee Ve as stated in Eq 13 The curl of this expression leads to Ee 0 as in the rst line of Eq 19 12Let us illustrate how the choice of the gauge condition allows one to retrieve the two sets of Galilean Maxwell equations in terms of the elds as stated by LBLL 1 In the magnetic limit the condition 1 leads to Eq 36 as mentioned earlier From the denition of Bm and using the identity A A 2A we obtain Bm Am 0 z Am 2Am 0jm where the last term follows from Eq 32 This is the third line of Eq 20 where the displacement current term is missing With Em dened as in Eq 11 its divergence gives Em tAm Vm t 0 z Am 2Vm m 0 where we have utilized again Eq 36 This is the second inhomogeneous equation last line of Eq 20 In the electric limit 1 and Eq 34 lead to the Lorenz condition Eq 35 Proceeding as in the magnetic limit we rst calculate the curl of Be which gives us Be Ae tVec2 z Ae 2Ae 1 c2tEe 0je We have utilized Eq 13 to dene Ee This is line three of Eq 19 Finally by calculating the divergence of Ee we nd Ee Ve 2Ve e 0 where we have used Eqs 13 and 32 Therefore let us point out forcefully that the choice of a gauge condition is dictated by the relativistic versus Galilean nature of the problem The Lorenz gauge condition must be chosen in the relativistic context as well as in the electric Galilean limit The Coulomb gauge condition can be chosen only in the magnetic limit For example this implies that quantization in the Coulomb gauge of light waves is prohibited because of Galilean covariance and must be reexamined We refer to a discussion of the physical meaning that one can ascribe to the various gauge conditions 14 From the historical point of view Galilean electromagnetism has shed a new light on the prerelativity era Indeed a careful reading of James Clerk Maxwells famous Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism reveals that he has employed the electric limit when dealing with dielectrics in his rst volume 20 On the other hand in his sec ond volume he used the magnetic limit when dealing with ohmic conductors except 13toward the end where he introduced into the magnetic limit equations the socalled displacement current by hand in order to demonstrate that light is a transverse electromagnetic wave 20 But as we have seen in the particular case of the electric limit and it is also valid in relativity the displacement current follows from choos ing the Lorenz gauge whereas Maxwell wrongfully kept the Coulomb gauge within the relativistic context for the elds This diculty enticed Hertz and Heaviside to abandon potentials and to cast Maxwells equations in terms of elds rather than po tentials Albert Einstein read Hertz papers on the topic and subsequently employed Maxwell equations in terms of the elds the HeavisideHertz formulation whereas Henri Poincare employed Maxwell equations in terms of the potentials the Riemann Lorenz formulation by adopting the Lorenz condition in a relativistic context 2 42 Magnetoquasistatics MHD and electroquasitatics EHD Experts working on magnetohydrodynamics MHD and experts of electrohydrody namics EHD might be surprised to realize that they actually work with dierent sets of approximations of the Maxwell equations where retardation and therefore waves has been neglected Indeed the displacement current is negligible in MHD as in Eq 20 whereas in EHD the electric eld has a vanishing curl Eq 19 Hence eects that are important in MHD becomes marginal in EHD and vice versa Melcher has greatly claried these facts by disjoining the electroquasistationary approximation used in EHD and the magnetoquasistationary approximation used in MHD 21 Section 32 of Melcher and Haus 21 shows that the underlying equations are precisely the same as the Galilean limits Eqs 19 and 20 His main argument relies on the comparison between three characteristics time scales is the electric conductivity 1 the magnetic diusion time m 0L2 2 the charge relaxation time e 0 and 3 the wave transit time em Lc e m which is the square root of the product of the two former time scales By denition the transit time is always between the magnetic and electric times For example in the magnetic limit the charge relaxation time scale is very small and the magnetic eld does have enough time to diuse inside the Ohmic carrier It is straightforward to see that the electroquasistatic of Melcher corresponds to the electric limit whereas the magnetic limit is just the magnetoquasistatic Hence a large amount of our technology is based on Galilean electromagnetism as soon as waves are neglected 43 The Faraday tensor and its dual It is well known that in special relativity the Faraday tensor dened in Eq 43 F A A in this section 0 1 2 3 and its dual F 1 2F 14do have the same physical meaning This is not the case within Galilean electro magnetism Indeed as pointed out by Earman and subsequently discussed by Ry nasiewicz the Galilean tranformations of the Faraday tensor and its dual lead to the electric or the magnetic limit respectively 22 The eect of this duality operation amounts to exchanging E and B as follows E cB and B Ec One recovers very easily the magnetic and electric limits Eqs 7 and 8 by applying the duality transformations directly to the electric transformations of the eld in order to get the magnetic transformations and vice versa It is also noted in Ref 22 that the eld transformations of the magnetic limit are obtained when E and B are expressed in terms of covariant or 0 2 tensor F whereas the electric limit is obtained when the elds transformations are calculated by using the contravariant or 2 0 tensor F Let us illustrate it briey with A V c A A V c A as well as 1 ct 1 ct The magnetic limit rests on the relation F F where the Galilean transformation matrix is dened by the fourgradient trans formation so that 1 vx c vy c vz c 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 The index denotes the line of each entry We nd for example E x c F 01 0 1 F 0 0 F01 2 0 F21 3 0 F31 1 cEx vyBz vzBy and B z F 12 1 2 F Bz which is Eq 7 15The electric limit transformations follows from F F The transformation matrix is now dened by the coordinate transformation x x with x ct x y z so that 1 0 0 0 vx c 1 0 0 vy c 0 1 0 vz c 0 0 1 Again the rst index denotes the matrix line For instance we compute E x c F 01 0 01 F 0 Ex c and B z F 12 1 2 F 1 0F 02 2 0F 10 F 12 Bz 1 c2vxEy vyEx which is Eq 8 44 Quantum mechanics In 1990 Dyson published a demonstration of Maxwell equations due to Richard Feyn man 23 This demonstration which relied on Lagrangians and quantum mechanics dated back to the forties and had remained hitherto unpublished However the proof was believed to be incomplete because Feynman had discussed only the homogeneous Maxwell equations given by the rst two lines in Eq 18 E tB B 0 In 1999 Brown and Holland revisited this demonstration and they have noted the Schrodinger equation admitted external potentials only if they were compatible with the magnetic limit of LBLL and therefore with the Coulomb gauge condition 24 It is clear from Eq 20 that the homogeneous Maxwell equations given above are valid only within the magnetic limit because the electric eld has zero curl in the electric limit Eq 19 This is a consequence of the Galilean magnetic limit of the four potential which does enters into Schrodinger equation Let us recall the statement of Brown and Holland more precisely The Schrodinger equation with external elds V x t and Ax t ihtx t 1 2mih Ax t2x t V x tx t 16is covariant under Galilean transformation Eq 6 with x t x t V x t V x t and Ax t Ax t if x t const expihmv x 1 2mv2t x t x t V x t V x t tx t v Ax t x t Ax t Ax t x t where x t is some scalar function Note that the factor in front of x t trans forms like the parameter s in Eq 39 If we choose x t 0 then the equations above reduce to Eq 10 which represents the Galilean transformations of the po tentials in the magnetic limit This point agrees with later results by Vaidya and Farina 25 In a subsequent study Holland and Brown have shown that Maxwell equations admit an electric limit only if the source is a Dirac current 26 In addition they have proved that the Dirac equation admits both Galilean limits just like Maxwell equations corroborating thereby earlier results by LevyLeblond 27 What Feynmann did not actually could not realize is that he had derived only the part of Maxwell equations compatible with both Galilean relativity and quantum mechanics that is the magnetic limit and hence the homogeneous equations 45 Superconductivity Superconductivity also enters into the realm of the magnetic limit because it selects the Coulomb gauge condition as a necessary consequence of Galilean covariance In deed the wellknown London equation states that the current density is proportional to the vector potential the star denotes Cooper pairs p mv qA 0 As a matter of fact there is a perfect transfert of electromagnetic momentum to kinetic momentum Hence contrary to what is usually stated gauge invariance is not bro ken by superconductivity since the Coulomb gauge condition is implied Moreover the Meissner eect can be explained by starting with Amperes equation written as B 0j that is without displacement current term as in the magnetic case third line of Eq 20 Hence this expression or more directly 2A 0j in the RiemannLorenz formulation together with A 0 and London equation leads to solutions in one dimension x of the type A exp const x so that the vector potential hence the magnetic eld only penetrates the superconductor to a depth 1const Superconductivity cannot be associated to a symmetry breaking of gauge invari ance but is magnetic Galilean covariant This unusual statement has been recently advocated by Martin Greiter by a dierent approach 28 As a matter of fact it is the global U1 phase rotation symmetry that is spontaneously violated A striking consequence is that the Higgs mechanism for providing mass to particles becomes doubtful since it was believed to be analogous to the assumed symmetry breaking of gauge invariance in superconductivity 1746 Electrodynamics of continuous media at low velocities One often nds in textbooks that a dielectric in motion is characterized by the pres ence of a motional polarization given by the following formula 29 P 0E vB 57 where is the dielectric susceptibility For example HA Lorentz utilized it in order to derive the FresnelFizeau formula at rst order see p 174176 of Ref 29 and Ref 30 We will see that this formula can be misleading Moreover in 1904 Lorentz claimed that a moving magnet could become electri cally polarized 31 In 1908 Einstein and Laub noted that Minkowski transforma tions for the elds and the excitations 32 predict that a moving magnetic dipole develops an electric dipole moment 33 It would be interesting to reexamine these predictions in the light of Galilean electromagnetism within continuous media In deed if one starts from the Minkowski transformations relating the polarization and the magnetization 32 one would expect two Galilean limits one with M M and P P v Mc2 and the other with M M v P and P P see Chapter 9 of Ref 29 We can derive from the RiemannLorenz formulation Maxwells equations within continuous media following ORahilly 12 More directly one can infer the form of Maxwell equations in continuous media by mimicking the vacuum case by either supressing the displacement current or the Faraday term Maxwell equations in continuous media are covariant under the PoincareLorentz transformations 32 B 0 tB E D H j tD In continuous media the constitutive laws relate the excitation D the eld E and the polarization M D 0E P B 0H M These relations are valid in both Galilean and Einsteinian relativity 32 Let us now turn to the electromagnetic laws when we take into account the motion of a medium at low velocity 21 First we recall the Galilean transformations for the dierentiation operators 18a t a t v a a b b a a b a b b a If a v and b A then A t A t v A v A Let us apply these transformations to the two Galilean limits of Maxwell equations expressed for a continuous medium We write rst Maxwell equations in a frame of reference R

conditions for moving media with n n12 the unit vector between the two media denoted by 1 and 2 Magnetic Limit Electric Limit n H2 H1 K n E2 E1 0 n B2 B1 0 n D2 D1 n j2 j1 K 0 n j2 j1 K vn2 1 t n E2

Lorentz is not compatible with Galilean relativity However the electric eld and the magnetic eld which create the polarization in Fizeau experiment come from a light wave so that Lorentz was right to use this formula after all even though there is no contradiction with the electric limit formula P P 0E 0E 47 Electrodynamics of moving bodies at low velocities Galilean electromagnetism raises severe doubts concerning our current understanding of the electrodynamics of moving media Indeed several experiments like the ones by Roentgen 34 Eichenwald 35 Wilson 36 Wilson and Wilson 37 Trouton and Noble 38 etc were believed to corroborate special relativity As we will demonstrate for the TroutonNoble experiment there is not always a need for special relativity because the typical relative velocity in these experiments is well below the speed of light Then the question is whether the above mentioned experiments be explained by either the electric limit the magnetic limit or a combination of both 471 The TroutonNoble experiment The TroutonNobles experiment is thought to be the electromagnetic analogue of the optical Michelson and Morley experiment 38 It was designed in order to show whether one can observe a mechanical velocity of the ether if one considers that the luminiferous medium should be a medium whose parts can be followed mechanically Like the null result of MichelsonMorleys optical experiment the TroutonNoble experiment was negative in the sense that one was not able to detect either an absolute motion with respect to the ether or a partial entrainment as believed by other various theories 20In 1905 Albert Einstein suggested to consider the ether as superuous since the ex periments were not able to detect a mechanical motion of it Others like H Poincare and HA Lorentz were reluctant to abandon the notion of ether as the bearer of the electromagnetic eld despite the fact that they have adopted the relativity princi ple However in 1920 Einstein recoursed to the ether as the bearer of the metric allowing the propagation of gravitational waves at a conference in Leyden Today even though the ether is a banished word in modern science one can use it as did the older Einstein in order to describe the vacuum with physical though not mechanical properties Before the advent of special relativity Hertz Wien Abraham Lorentz Cohn and others have used the transformations given in Eq 2 which is an incoherent mixture of the electric and magnetic Galilean limits 39 As mentioned previously these expressions do not even obey the group property of composition of transformations Trouton and Noble expected a positive eect when a charged capacitor is in motion with an angle between the plates and the velocity 38 Indeed the electric eld in the frame of the capacitor generates a magnetic eld in the ether frame v is the absolute velocity B 1 c2vE that is B 1 c2vE sin Hence there is a localization of magnetic energy density inside a volume dV dW 1 2 B 0 dV 1 2 v2 c2 0E2 sin2 dV With the volume of the capacitor given by Sl the total energy between the plates is W 1 2 v2 c2 0E2 sin2 Sl If one denotes as V El the dierence of potential between the plates then the capacitor is submitted to the electrical torque dW d 0 2 V 2S l v2 c2 sin2 which is maximal for 45 and zero for 90 Hence the plates must be perpendicular to the velocity One does not observe such an eect in practice In order to understand what is wrong with the above demonstration we rst re call that the electric limit transforms as in Eq 8 A straightforward application of these transformations is to note that the BiotSavart law follows from the Coulomb law associated to the electric transformation of the magnetic eld Contrary to the 21transformations used by Lorentz and TroutonNoble they do respect the group addi tivity Besides these transformations are only compatible with the approximate set of Maxwell equations where the time derivative in the Faraday equation vanishes as in Eq 19 Hence we can derive easily the approximate Poyntings theorem within the electric limit from this set t 1 20E2 EB 0 j E 58 As we can see the energy density is of electrical origin only Hence no electric energy associated with the motional magnetic eld can be taken into account within the electric limit since it is of order v2c2 with respect to the static or quasistatic electric one Thus the TroutonNoble experiment does not show any eect as soon as we are in the realm of the electric limit We recall that the electric limit is such that the relative velocity is small compared to the velocity of light c and the order of magnitude of the electric eld is large compared to the product of c by the magnetic eld Of course for larger velocities special relativity is needed and we must take into account additional mechanical torque due to lenght contraction as usual now in order to have a negative result no torque The conclusion of Trouton and Noble is rather illuminating concerning the fact that they did consider the energy of the motional magnetic eld to be the source of the negative result 38 There is no doubt that the result is a purely negative one As the energy of the magnetic eld if it exists and from our present point of view we must suppose it does must come from somewhere we are driven to the conclusion that the elec trostatic energy of a capacitor must dimininish by the amount 120E2v2c2 when moving with a velocity v at right angles to its electrostatic lines of force where 120E2 is the electrostatic energy Conversely a solenoidmagnet in motion will not create a motionnal magnetic torque because the magnetic energy associated with the motional electric eld is negligible compared to the magnetic energy of the static or quasistatic magnetic eld 472 Einstein asymmetry In his famous article on the electrodynamics of moving media Albert Einstein pointed out the importance of whether or not one should ascribe energy to the elds when dealing with motion 40 We reproduced here the introduction of his paper It is known that Maxwells electrodynamics as usually understood at the present time when applied to moving bodies leads to asymmetries which do not appear to be inherent in the phenomena Take for example the reciprocal electrodynamic action 22of a magnet and a conductor The observable phenomenon here depends only on the relative motion of the conductor and the magnet whereas the customary view draws a sharp distinction between the two cases in which either one or the other of these bodies is in motion For if the magnet is in motion and the conductor at rest there arises in the neighbourhood of the magnet an electric eld with a certain denite en ergy producing a current at the places where parts of the conductor are situated But if the magnet is stationary and the conductor in motion then no electric eld arises in the neighbourhood of the magnet In the conductor however we nd an electro motive force to which in itself there is no corresponding energy but which gives rise assuming equality of relative motion in the two cases discussed to electric currents of the same path and intensity as those produced by the electric forces in the former case Like our discussion of the TroutonNoble experiment the magnetic Poyntings theorem can explain why one cannot ascribe an energy to the motional electric eld in Einsteins thought experiment t B2 20 EB 0 j E This is the magnetic analogue of Eq 58 By applying the Lorentz transformation that he had derived in the kinematical analysis of his article to the Maxwell equations in fact he used the HeavisideHertz formulation unlike Poincare who used the RiemannLorenz formulation in his rela tivity article Einstein replaced Lorentzs explanation 1 If a unit electric point charge is in motion in an electromagnetic eld there acts upon it in addition to the electric force an electromotive force which if we ne glect the terms multiplied by the second and higher powers of vc is equal to the vector product of the velocity of the charge and the magnetic force divided by the velocity of light Old manner of expression by the now famous special relativity explanation valid for all velocities 2 If a unit electric point charge is in motion in an electromagnetic eld the force acting upon it is equal to the electric force which is present at the locality of the charge and which we ascertain by transformation of the eld to a system of co ordinates at rest relatively to the electrical charge New manner of expression Then he concluded The analogy holds with magnetomotive forces We see that electromotive force plays in the developed theory merely the part of an auxiliary concept which owes its 23introduction to the circumstance that electric and magnetic forces do not exist in dependently of the state of motion of the system of coordinates Furthermore it is clear that the asymmetry mentioned in the introduction as arising when we consider the currents produced by the relative motion of a magnet and a conductor now dis appears Moreover questions as to the seat of electrodynamic electromotive forces unipolar machines now have no point However we point out forcefully that the Galilean magnetic transformations of the electromagnetic eld are sucient to explain the magnet and conductor thought experiment of Albert Einstein as Lorentz covariance is not necessary 41 It means that the second postulate constancy of the velocity of light used by Einstein was not necessary to explain the thought experiment Only the relativity postulate and the magnetic Galilean transformations are necessary as the usual relative velocity of a real experiment is much more inferior to the velocity of light Hence for low velocities regime we proposed the following removal of Einsteins asymmetry 3 If a unit electric point charge is in motion in an electromagnetic eld the force acting upon it is equal to the electric force which is present at the locality of the charge and which we ascertain by a Galilean magnetic transformation of the eld to a system of coordinates at rest relatively to the electrical charge New manner of expression only valid for low velocities Einstein was right to replace Lorentz explanation as Lorentz thought that the cross product of the velocity and the magnetic eld was not an electric eld thats why the latter called it in particular the electromotive eld But Einstein did not see that the same cross product was an eective electric eld due to a magnetic Galilean transformations Wolfgang Pauli provided a resolution of the asymmetry in his text book on electrodynamics but he only assumed that his calculations were a rst order approximation of the relativistic demonstration without acknowledging the existence of a Galilean approximation as the magnetic limit 42 Hence Einsteins procedure to remove the asymmetry is completely valid despite the fact that special relativity is not necessary to remove it but only sucient Hence ironically the thought ex periment who leaded Albert Einstein to special relativity could have been explained by Galilean relativity only with the use of the magnetic limit As pointed out a long time ago by Keswani and Kilminster 43 Maxwell did re solve Einsteins asymmetry within the formalism of the magnetic limit In all phenomena relating to closed circuits and the current in them it is indif ferent whether the axes to which we refer the system be at rest or in motion Indeed 24The electromotive intensity is expressed by a formula of the same type wheter the motions of the conductors be referred to xed axes or to axes moving in space the only dierences between the formulae being that in the case of moving axes the electric potential V must be changed into V V vA In all cases in which a current is produced in a conducting circuit the electromotive force is the lineintegral e R C Eds taken round the curve The value of V disappears from this integral so that the introduction of vA has no inuence on its value Concluding remarks One century after the relativity revolution and more than thirty years after the for gotten work of LevyLeblond and Le Bellac Galilean electromagnetism is becoming a eld of actual research as we can explain much more simply scores of experiments involving the electrodynamics of moving media without the sophisticated formalism of special relativity Moreover for slow velocities it is now obvious that special relativitys eects such as the length variation cannot explain as it was believed so far these experi ments since it is negligible In the realm of mechanics what would have happened if Newton was born after Einstein We are exactly in this situation with respect to electromagnetism
