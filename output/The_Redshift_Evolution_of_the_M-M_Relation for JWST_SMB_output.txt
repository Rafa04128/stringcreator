2 1Center for Astrophysics Harvard Smithsonian Cambridge MA 02138 USA 2Black Hole Initiative Harvard University Cambridge MA 02138 USA ABSTRACT JWST has detected many overmassive galactic systems at z 4 where the mass of the black hole M is 10100 times larger than expected from local relations given the hosts stellar mass M This Letter presents a model to describe these overmassive systems in the highz Universe We suggest that the black hole mass is the main driver of highz star formation quenching SMBHs globally impact their highz galaxies because their hosts are physically small and the black holes have duty cycles close to unity at z 4 In this regime we assume that black hole mass growth is regulated by the quasars output while stellar mass growth is quenched by it and uncorrelated to the global properties of the host halo We find that the ratio MM controls the average star formation efficiency if MM 81018n fEddbMhmM1 then the galaxy is unable to form stars efficiently Once this ratio exceeds the threshold a runaway process brings the originally overmassive system towards the local M M relation Furthermore the M M relation evolves with redshift as 1 z52 At z 5 we find an overmassive factor of 55 in excellent agreement with current JWST data and the highz relation inferred from those Extending the black hole horizon farther in redshift and lower in mass will test this model and improve our understanding of the early coevolution of black holes and galaxies Keywords Active galaxies 17 Supermassive black holes 1663 Galaxy evolution 594 Star formation 1569 Surveys 1671 1 INTRODUCTION During the first year of operations of the James Webb Space Telescope JWST one of the most re markable discoveries was the detection of a popula tion of lowermass 106 108 M lowerluminosity 1044 1046 erg s1 supermassive black holes SMBHs at z 4 Harikane et al 2023 Maiolino et al 2023a Ubler et al 2023 Stone et al 2023 Furtak et al 2023 Kokorev et al 2023 Yue et al 2023 Bogdan et al 2023 reaching up to a redshift of z 106 with GNz11 Maiolino et al 2023b A comparison to the properties of the most distant quasar in the preJWST era with a mass of M 16 04 109 M at z 76 Wang et al 2021 clarifies how much JWST has expanded our view on the early population of black holes both upward in redshift and downward in mass The lower luminosity of these SMBHs allowed the detection of starlight from their hosts see eg Ding et al 2023 and estimate some of their properties eg their stellar and dynamical mass and gas velocity dis persions Some of these SMBHs were identified in the socalled little red dots Matthee et al 2023 con taining hidden little monsters Kocevski et al 2023 which are lowluminosity strikingly red objects Re cently Greene et al 2023 used spectroscopy from the JWSTUNCOVER program to argue that 60 of these objects are dustreddened AGN young galaxies hosting a lowluminosity SMBH at their center The discovery of a lowerluminosity population of SMBHs and their hosts properties led to an additional unexpected discovery In the local Universe wellknown relations connect the mass of the central SMBHs with physical properties of their hosts see eg Magorrian et al 1998 Ferrarese Merritt 2000 Gebhardt et al 2000 Kormendy Ho 2013 For example the MM relation links the SMBH mass and the stellar mass of the host Reines Volonteri 2015 found that the mass of the central SMBH is 01 of the stellar mass of their hosts with a scatter of 055 dex or a factor 35 A significant wealth of data from numerous JWST sur veys indicates the detection of SMBHs at z 4 that are 10 100 times overmassive when compared to the stel lar content of their hosts Harikane et al 2023 Maiolino arXiv240104159v1 astrophGA 8 Jan 20242 et al 2023a Ubler et al 2023 Stone et al 2023 Furtak et al 2023 Kokorev et al 2023 Yue et al 2023 The mass of these SMBHs is not 01 of the stellar mass of their hosts but rather 1 10 or even close to 100 in some cases Bogdan et al 2023 A detailed statistical analysis of these data with an MCMC algorithm that takes into account observational biases eg see Lauer et al 2007 finds that this popula tion of lowermass SMBHs at z 4 violate the M M relation at 3 Pacucci et al 2023 Interestingly Maiolino et al 2023a notes that while the SMBHs are overmassive with respect to the M M relation other scaling relations such as the M and the M Mdyn relations with the velocity dispersion and the dynami cal mass respectively hold at 4 z 7 Altogether recent JWST data suggests that the M and the M Mdyn relations are fundamental and universal because they are powered by the depth of the gravi tational potential well generated by the central SMBH Instead the MM relation could evolve with redshift The M and the M Mdyn relations are linked so it is not surprising that once one holds the other follows Instead the hosts stellar mass is measured in dependently Despite significant uncertainties affecting stellar mass and black hole mass measurements Pacucci et al 2023 find that unless most overmassive SMBHs found so far are characterized by errors of a factor 60 in their black hole mass or their stellar mass all in the same direction ie all increasing M or decreasing M this result holds Note that typical reported errors at 1 are of a factor 3 in M and a factor 4 in M see eg Maiolino et al 2023a Theoretical predictions dating back 20 years sug gest that scaling relations evolve with redshift For instance Wyithe Loeb 2003 argued that the ra tio MM should scale as 1 z32 due to self regulation via quasar Silk Rees 1998 and supernova feedback Quasar activity is efficient in quenching star formation via the effect of strong outflows or by heating the gas eg Fabian 2012 Heckman Best 2014 King Pounds 2015 although there is at least one exam ple of a black hole triggering star formation in a dwarf galaxy Schutte Reines 2022 Other works have studied the redshift evolution of scaling relations using numerical simulations eg Robertson et al 2006 Di Matteo et al 2008 Sijacki et al 2015 semianalytic models eg Malbon et al 2007 Kisaka Kojima 2010 observations eg Peng et al 2006 Decarli et al 2010 Merloni et al 2010 Trakht enbrot Netzer 2010 Bennert et al 2011 or combi nations of those eg Booth Schaye 2011 especially at z 2 More recently Caplar et al 2018 developed a phenomenological model based on observations and found that the ratio MM scales as 1 z15 at z 2 in agreement with Wyithe Loeb 2003 In this Letter we present a model that explains the evolution at z 4 of the M M relation for SMBHs in JWST data Furthermore we develop a condition on the ratio MM to probe whether the quasar feed back stunts star formation The model makes predic tions that can be tested with future JWST data 2 MODEL PRINCIPLES We start with the principles of our model for highz overmassive systems The model we present is valid only in the highz Universe where the typical growth time for black holes tg is similar to the age of the Universe tg tage The basis of our model is that the black hole mass is the primary parameter that controls highz star for mation quenching This premise is supported by recent analyses of JWSTCEERS data with cosmological simu lations Illustris TNG and EAGLE showing that high z galaxy quenching is primarily regulated by the mass of the SMBH Piotrowska et al 2022 Bluck et al 2023 Previous cosmological simulations already showed that star formation quenching should scale with energy in put from the central SMBH over the entire lifetime of the galaxy which is proportional to the black hole mass Terrazas et al 2020 Bluck et al 2023 Active SMBHs in z 4 galaxies discovered by JWST are effective at quenching star formation for at least two reasons First highz galaxies are physically small the ionized bubble generated by active SMBHs likely extends to the entire galaxy Typical physical sizes of galaxies detected by JWST at z 79 are characterized by effective radii of 80 pc re 300 pc with a mean value of re 150 pc Baggen et al 2023 This typical physical size has to be compared with the radius of the ionization bubble created by a SMBH accreting at its Eddington rate For a 107 M SMBH as typically found in these overmas sive systems Pacucci et al 2023 this radius can extend as much as 700 kpc see eg Cen Haiman 2000 Madau Rees 2000 White et al 2003 Regions of highdensity gas presumably present in the highz galax ies could effectively shield the radiation from the SMBH and still allow localized star formation this would how ever be ineffective in generating largescale star forma tion Hence SMBHs were effective in quenching star formation because they had a global impact on the en tire host Note that previous studies eg Chen et al 2020 already highlighted the importance of the radius of starforming galaxies in determining the growth of their SMBHs3 00 02 04 06 08 10 12 14 Growth Time Gyr 00 02 04 06 08 10 12 14 Age of the Universe Gyr Seed Mass 102 M

Comparison between the growth time assuming a light seed of 100 M and the age of the Universe at detection for the overmassive systems detected by JWST thus far The dashed line indicates where the growth time equals the Universes age at that detection redshift The data points are colored according to their detection redshift shown in the color bar Right panel same as the left panel but the growth time assumes a heavy seed of 104 M Second in the highz Universe the growth time of black holes is comparable to the age of the Universe Hence central SMBHs at a given redshift z are active for a time comparable to the Hubble time tagez if z 4 Figure 1 shows for the highz overmassive systems de tected thus far by JWST a comparison between the age of the Universe at detection and growth time This latter time is calculated assuming a continuous growth from a seeding redshift of z 25 see eg Barkana Loeb 2001 at the Eddington rate assuming a light seed of 100 M left panel or a heavy seed of 104 M right panel At higher redshift the age of the Uni verse is comparable to or even shorter than the growth time for those two specific seeding scenarios hence the activity duty cycle for those specific SMBHs has to be close to unity Because their duty cycle is close to unity these SMBHs are constantly injecting energy into the primeval galaxy and heating the cold gas necessary to produce stars Once the age of the Universe is 1 Gyr the SMBH is active only for a fraction of the Hub ble time and stars can then form from cold molecular gas which becomes widely available in the galaxy This hypothesis is further confirmed by a recent analy sis of 45 z 12 galaxies in the JWSTCEERS survey Cole et al 2023 showing a higher variability of star formation activity at high redshift Stars form primarily in short periods of starburst activity with starforming duty cycles of only 20 at z 9 and 40 at z 5 The study also suggests a smoother star formation activity at z 45 when the age of the Universe is 1 Gyr and the quasar duty cycle drops significantly below unity 21 Assumptions on the Growth of M and M The two assumptions in our model for highz overmas sive systems are the following vc is the circular velocity of the galactic halo see Barkana Loeb 2001 1 Black hole mass growth is regulated by the quasar output This leads to the scaling M v5 c 2 Stellar mass growth is quenched by the quasar out put and uncorrelated with vc M vc The first scaling is easily demonstrated as follows see the same derivation in Wyithe Loeb 2003 Assume that the central SMBH of mass M is emitting energy at a fraction of the Eddington luminosity LEdd with LEdd M Let us further assume that a fraction F of LEdd is trapped by the gas within the galaxy The self regulation hypothesis predicts that the growth of the central SMBH shuts off when the total luminosity out put of the SMBH absorbed by the gas over a dynamical time tdyn is equal to the binding energy of the host halo of total mass Mh LEddF 1 2 bMhv2 c mtdyn 1 where bm is the baryon fraction From Barkana Loeb 2001 we derive the depen dence of the circular velocity of stars with respect to the halo mass Mh and the redshift z vc 245 Mh 1012M 13 z16 1 z 3 12 km s1 24 where the factor z is defined as m zm c 182 z m 1 m 1 z3 1 c 182 82d 39d2 d z m 1 As Mh v3 c our previous selfregulation equation im plies that M v5 c Regarding the second assumption it is essential to note that the circular velocity vc depends on the total mass of the halo not on its stellar mass We argue that the total halo mass corresponding to a given circular velocity vc is in place However it is not forming stars efficiently because their growth is inhibited by highduty cycle quasar activity in a smallsize galaxy This second assumption can be tested experimentally From JWST observations at redshift 4 z 7 see eg Maiolino et al 2023a there is no relation between the stellar mass of the host and the measured velocity dispersion of the galaxy While the values vary in the Maiolino et al 2023a dataset in a range of 03 dex the stellar masses vary for 25 dex A Pearsons 2tailed correlation test yields no correlation pvalue 003 at 5 significance Hence M 0 v0 c At these redshifts and for these stellar masses there is no indication that the stellar mass growth is regulated by either supernova or the quasar feedback In this regard our treatment is fundamentally different from Wyithe Loeb 2003 3 RESULTS Next we derive our results a condition on the ratio MM for the average star formation rate to be effec tively quenched at highz Sec 31 and a prediction for the redshift evolution of the M M relation at z 4 Sec 32 31 A Condition for Star Formation Quenching We have developed a theoretical condition on the ra tio MM to understand if quasar feedback is efficient in quenching star formation and to which extent We then test this hypothesis with the 35 overmassive sys tems discovered by JWST at z 4 Harikane et al 2023 Maiolino et al 2023a Ubler et al 2023 Stone et al 2023 Furtak et al 2023 Kokorev et al 2023 Yue et al 2023 Bogdan et al 2023 Before proceeding we note that galaxies meeting the condition for star formation quenching developed here are not prevented from forming stars altogether or even at the observation time After all the 35 overmassive systems studied here contain 108 1011 M in stars which must have formed at some point Likely the ex isting stellar masses were formed when the black hole mass was small and the quasar feedback was weak Our condition on the ratio MM prevents star formation from being efficient over the entire lifetime of the galac tic system up to detection In other words the criterion we developed applies to the time average of the star for mation rate not to its instantaneous value Despite this note it is reassuring to report that out of the 35 over massive systems studied here only 3 display large far infrared luminosities which may indicate ongoing star formation Stone et al 2023 We assume that star formation is quenched once the SMBH injects sufficient energy into the system to raise the temperature above the virial one Recently Gelli et al 2023 used a similar formalism to argue that su pernova feedback fails to quench star formation in high z galaxies This finding supports our model principles detailed in Sec 2 A simple model to describe the energetics of a pri mordial galaxy includes H and C the rate of energy injection heating and the rate of energy subtraction cooling The power injected into the system for a SMBH ac creting at Eddington ratio fEdd defined as the ratio between the actual accretion rate and the Eddington rate is H fEdd 4GMmpc T 3 where G is the gravitational constant mp is the proton mass c is the speed of light and T is the Thomson cross section The energy of a gas characterized by pure transla tional kinetic energy at the virial temperature Tvir is E 32NkBTvir where N is the total number of par ticles and kB is the Boltzmann constant Expressing the cooling time as tcool 3kBTvirn where is the cooling function and n is the gas number density see eg Rees Ostriker 1977 Barkana Loeb 2001 we can express the cooling rate as C 1 2 n mp Mg 4 Here Tvir Z is the cooling function in terms of the virial temperature and metallicity 06 is the mean molecular weight for ionized gas and Mg is the gas mass This last term can be expressed as the baryon mass of the halo minus the mass in stars Mg bmMh M Note that the cooling function has units erg s1 cm35 The condition that feedback heats the gas mass above its virial temperature in the small highz galaxy is H C This condition can be expressed in terms of the ratio MM as follows M M 1 8 nT Gcm2p fEdd b m Mh M 1 5 Expressing the constants in numerical form with units equal to the reciprocal of erg s1 this translates into M M 8 1018 n fEdd b m Mh M 1 6 We adopt fEdd 1 for our calculations because over massive systems discovered by JWST are estimated to be accreting at rates 01 fEdd 5 Harikane et al 2023 Maiolino et al 2023a Furthermore we use the median cooling function for the gas metallicity range 01 ZZ 03 and the mean gas number density 05 cm3 calculated for simulated galaxies in the redshift range 5 z 10 by Robinson et al 2022 The metallicity range used is justified by a recent study with JWST of z 6 galaxies with masses 1010 M show ing typical values 12 logOH 82 which is 25 of the solar value Nakajima et al 2023 Finally we assume the values of the cosmological parameters from Planck Collaboration et al 2020 and the halo mass to stellar mass ratio from Behroozi et al 2019 In Fig 2 we show the condition on the ratio MM First we note that for large stellar masses M 1011 M the threshold ratio tends to the local one log10MM 3 This indicates that quasar quenching of overmassive systems at highz leads nat urally to a ratio similar to the one implicit in the lo cal relation Central SMBHs grow until feedback self regulates it or the available gas runs out Then when the quasars duty cycle drops below unity efficient star formation can resume mergers with other galaxies also bring additional mass in stars Eventually stellar mass growth by insitu formation and mergers pushes the sys tem below the threshold and towards the local M M relation Note that this threshold can only be crossed once in the downward direction If a SMBH is overmassive it will decrease the average star formation efficiency until it shuts off Once stars begin to form again the system will move downward and eventually cross the threshold At that point star formation is not quenched anymore a runaway process occurs that pushes the system more into the starforming region This process ends with the system close to the local M M relation Figure 2 shows the location of the aforementioned 35 overmassive systems discovered by JWST at z 4 All these systems are either well inside the area where star formation is quenched or close to the threshold value Typically higher redshift systems ie with z 5 see the ones by Kokorev et al 2023 and Bogdan et al 2023 are deeper into the quenching regime than lower red shift ones with z 4 The only system whose location is marginally compatible with the threshold possibly in dicating that the galaxy is about to restart efficient star formation is CEERS 01665 at z 4483 Harikane et al 2023 In Fig 2 we also show a sample of local z 0 galaxies from Reines Volonteri 2015 which are used to in fer the local M M relation Although the threshold ratio MM is computed for highz systems and not necessarily valid in the local Universe it is reassuring to see that most of the local galaxies on the M M rela tion reside well into the regime where star formation is active or close to the boundary This fact further sug gests that highz overmassive systems migrate towards the local M M relation by crossing the threshold once Some of the z 4 overmassive systems share their locus in the diagram with these local galaxies 32 The Redshift Evolution of the M M Relation We now derive a function to describe the redshift evo lution of the M M relation Based on the two prin ciples described in Sec 2 we obtained the following scaling for M and M as a function of the circular ve locity of the host halo M v5 c and M v0 c Hence MM v5 c Given the scaling of the circular velocity with redshift Eq 2 we obtain M M z561 z52 7 Note that z is a weakly varying function of the red shift the main scaling is with the term 1 z52 We define a redshift evolution function Ez Ez z561 z52 056 8 and note that Ez indicates how much SMBHs at red shift z are overmassive when compared to what is ex pected from local z 0 relations The value of Ez for 0 z 15 is shown in Fig 3 For example for typical overmassive systems at z 5 Pacucci et al 2023 we obtain E5 55 174 dex see Fig 3 This indicates that SMBHs in the sample should be 55 times overmassive compared to the local M M relation Equation 8 implies that M M by z 30 in agreement with standard scenarios for the formation of black hole seeds Barkana Loeb 20016 Figure 2 Condition on the ratio MM for quasar feedback to suppress the average star formation efficiency Active galaxies that reside in the green area with a ratio MM above the threshold indicated with a black line experience quasar activity that increases the gas temperature above the virial value Colored symbols indicate overmassive systems discovered by JWST at z 4 as the legend indicates Gray symbols indicate local galaxies on the M M relation from Reines Volonteri 2015 whose ratio MM is shown as a dashed line Figure 3 Value of the logarithm in base 10 of Ez for 0 z 15 The values for z 5 and z 10 are marked and indicated In Fig 4 we use the factor Ez to rescale the local relation Reines Volonteri 2015 to higher redshifts The scalingup to z 5 the median redshift of the sam ple of overmassive systems used by Pacucci et al 2023 agrees remarkably well with the inferred relation deter mined by the same study We also scale up the local relation to z 10 ie a factor of 245 This scaledup relation is still too low to explain the extremely over massive system at z 10 described by Bogdan et al 2023 Uncertainties in its black hole and stellar mass could explain the discrepancy 4 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS Before the Hubble Space Telescope performed its first deep field image it was argued that it would not re veal significantly more galaxies than ground telescopes Bahcall et al 1990 A similar surprise came during the first year of JWST which unraveled many galaxies at z 4 hosting a SMBH Line diagnostics and Xray detections suggest typical SMBH masses of 106 108 M With bolo metric luminosities 12 orders of magnitude lower than the bright quasars discovered thus far at z 6 their relative faintness allowed the detection of starlight from their hosts For the first time observers could inves tigate the relation between black hole and stellar mass at highz The data led to the conclusion that highz7 7 8 9 10 11 12 Log M M 6 7 8 9 10 Log M M Local relation Reines Volonteri 2015 Highz relation z 5 Pacucci et al 2023 M M scaled at z 5 M M scaled at z 10 JWST galaxies at z 47 JWST galaxies at z 7 Figure 4 The M M plane is populated with the overmassive systems discovered by JWST at z 4 categorized into two groups 4 z 7 and z 7 The local relation Reines Volonteri 2015 is shown in yellow and scaled up at z 5 red and z 10 blue according to Eq 8 The dashed black line indicates the highz relation inferred from JWST data by Pacucci et al 2023 Our model for the redshift evolution of the M M relation predicts the trend remarkably well SMBHs are 10 100 times overmassive with respect to the stellar mass of their hosts Pacucci et al 2023 Significant uncertainties affect the determination of the stellar mass derived from SED fitting to galaxy tem plates and the SMBH mass derived from singleepoch virial estimators based for example on the width of the H line of the broad line region see eg Greene Ho 2005 These methods are calibrated in the local Uni verse z 1 and have yet to be thoroughly tested at higher redshift see eg the discussion in Maiolino et al 2023a Notwithstanding these uncertainties to retrieve the local scaling relations the black hole masses stellar masses of these highz overmassive systems would need to be overestimated underestimated by a factor 60 Pacucci et al 2023 If further data confirms this result it opens up an important question Why are these highz black holes so overmassive with respect to the stellar mass of their hosts while other relations such as the M hold Maiolino et al 2023a In this Letter we have developed a model to explain highz overmassive systems The overarching idea is that SMBHs exert an outsized influence on their host galaxies at highz because their hosts are small and the black holes have duty cycles close to unity at z 4 Hence the black hole mass is the primary parameter re sponsible for highz star formation quenching It follows that black hole mass growth is regulated by its energy output while the stellar mass growth is quenched by it and its instantaneous value is uncorrelated to the global properties of the host halo Our main results are as follows In the highz Universe the ratio MM controls the average star formation efficiency If MM 81018n fEddbMhmM1 star for mation is quenched by quasar feedback Once this threshold is crossed a runaway process brings the originally overmassive system close to the local M M relation The local M M relation evolves with redshift as Ez z561 z52056 1 z52 where z is weakly dependent on redshift We find a value of Ez 5 55 which is in excellent agreement with current JWST data and the highz relation inferred by Pacucci et al 2023 Our model suggests that early SMBHs primarily if formed as heavy seeds of initial mass 104 105 M8 see eg Ferrara et al 2014 affect the evolution of the entire host Eventually the activity duty cycle of the quasar drops significantly below unity and efficient star formation can resume Once the galaxy grows via mergers more stars and cool gas are added Eventually stars catch up with the SMBH mass selfregulation of star formation occurs see eg Wyithe Loeb 2003 and the system reaches the local M M relation Understanding the highredshift evolution of the scal ing relations is fundamental for two reasons First it informs us about the physical processes that regulate the growth of the black hole and stellar component see eg Vogelsberger et al 2014 Schaye et al 2015 Wein berger et al 2017 Nelson et al 2018 Terrazas et al 2020 Piotrowska et al 2022 Bluck et al 2023 Second it may inform us of the seeding mechanism that formed the central black hole in the first place In fact several studies have shown that a high ratio MM may be in dicative of the formation of a heavy seed see eg Agar wal et al 2013 Natarajan et al 2017 Visbal Haiman 2018 Scoggins et al 2023 Natarajan et al 2023 at z 20 The study of the properties of central SMBHs and their hosts at highz as well as the detection of extremely massive and rare SMBHs at z 10 will de termine if heavy seed formation channels were active in the highz Universe Pacucci Loeb 2022 JWST and upcoming facilities such as Euclid the Ru bin Observatory and the Roman Space Telescope are pushing the observable horizon for black holes farther in redshift and lower in mass The discovery of still un detected populations of compact objects will ultimately clarify how all the black holes in the Universe formed Acknowledgments FP acknowledges fruitful
