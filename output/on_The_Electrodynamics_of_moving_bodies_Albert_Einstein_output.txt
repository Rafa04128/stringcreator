ON THE ELECTRODYNAMICS OF MOVING BODIES By A EINSTEIN June 30 1905 It is known that Maxwells electrodynamicsas usually understood at the present timewhen applied to moving bodies leads to asymmetries which do not appear to be inherent in the phenomena Take for example the recipro cal electrodynamic action of a magnet and a conductor The observable phe nomenon here depends only on the relative motion of the conductor and the magnet whereas the customary view draws a sharp distinction between the two cases in which either the one or the other of these bodies is in motion For if the magnet is in motion and the conductor at rest there arises in the neighbour hood of the magnet an electric eld with a certain denite energy producing a current at the places where parts of the conductor are situated But if the magnet is stationary and the conductor in motion no electric eld arises in the neighbourhood of the magnet In the conductor however we nd an electro motive force to which in itself there is no corresponding energy but which gives riseassuming equality of relative motion in the two cases discussedto elec tric currents of the same path and intensity as those produced by the electric forces in the former case Examples of this sort together with the unsuccessful attempts to discover any motion of the earth relatively to the light medium suggest that the phenomena of electrodynamics as well as of mechanics possess no properties corresponding to the idea of absolute rest They suggest rather that as has already been shown to the rst order of small quantities the same laws of electrodynamics and optics will be valid for all frames of reference for which the equations of mechanics hold good1 We will raise this conjecture the purport of which will hereafter be called the Principle of Relativity to the status of a postulate and also introduce another postulate which is only apparently irreconcilable with the former namely that light is always propagated in empty space with a denite velocity c which is independent of the state of motion of the emitting body These two postulates suce for the attainment of a simple and consistent theory of the electrodynamics of moving bodies based on Maxwells theory for stationary bodies The introduction of a luminiferous ether will prove to be superuous inasmuch as the view here to be developed will not require an absolutely stationary space provided with special properties nor 1The preceding memoir by Lorentz was not at this time known to the author 1assign a velocityvector to a point of the empty space in which electromagnetic processes take place The theory to be developed is basedlike all electrodynamicson the kine matics of the rigid body since the assertions of any such theory have to do with the relationships between rigid bodies systems of coordinates clocks and electromagnetic processes Insucient consideration of this circumstance lies at the root of the diculties which the electrodynamics of moving bodies at present encounters I KINEMATICAL PART 1 Denition of Simultaneity Let us take a system of coordinates in which the equations of Newtonian mechanics hold good2 In order to render our presentation more precise and to distinguish this system of coordinates verbally from others which will be introduced hereafter we call it the stationary system If a material point is at rest relatively to this system of coordinates its position can be dened relatively thereto by the employment of rigid standards of measurement and the methods of Euclidean geometry and can be expressed in Cartesian coordinates If we wish to describe the motion of a material point we give the values of its coordinates as functions of the time Now we must bear carefully in mind that a mathematical description of this kind has no physical meaning unless we are quite clear as to what we understand by time We have to take into account that all our judgments in which time plays a part are always judgments of simultaneous events If for instance I say That train arrives here at 7 oclock I mean something like this The pointing of the small hand of my watch to 7 and the arrival of the train are simultaneous events3 It might appear possible to overcome all the diculties attending the deni tion of time by substituting the position of the small hand of my watch for time And in fact such a denition is satisfactory when we are concerned with dening a time exclusively for the place where the watch is located but it is no longer satisfactory when we have to connect in time series of events occurring at dierent places orwhat comes to the same thingto evaluate the times of events occurring at places remote from the watch We might of course content ourselves with time values determined by an observer stationed together with the watch at the origin of the coordinates and coordinating the corresponding positions of the hands with light signals given out by every event to be timed and reaching him through empty space But this coordination has the disadvantage that it is not independent of the standpoint of the observer with the watch or clock as we know from experience 2ie to the rst approximation 3We shall not here discuss the inexactitude which lurks in the concept of simultaneity of two events at approximately the same place which can only be removed by an abstraction 2We arrive at a much more practical determination along the following line of thought If at the point A of space there is a clock an observer at A can determine the time values of events in the immediate proximity of A by nding the positions of the hands which are simultaneous with these events If there is at the point B of space another clock in all respects resembling the one at A it is possible for an observer at B to determine the time values of events in the immediate neigh bourhood of B But it is not possible without further assumption to compare in respect of time an event at A with an event at B We have so far dened only an A time and a B time We have not dened a common time for A and B for the latter cannot be dened at all unless we establish by denition that the time required by light to travel from A to B equals the time it requires to travel from B to A Let a ray of light start at the A time tA from A towards B let it at the B time tB be reected at B in the direction of A and arrive again at A at the A time t A In accordance with denition the two clocks synchronize if tB tA t A tB We assume that this denition of synchronism is free from contradictions and possible for any number of points and that the following relations are universally valid 1 If the clock at B synchronizes with the clock at A the clock at A syn chronizes with the clock at B 2 If the clock at A synchronizes with the clock at B and also with the clock at C the clocks at B and C also synchronize with each other Thus with the help of certain imaginary physical experiments we have set tled what is to be understood by synchronous stationary clocks located at dif ferent places and have evidently obtained a denition of simultaneous or synchronous and of time The time of an event is that which is given simultaneously with the event by a stationary clock located at the place of the event this clock being synchronous and indeed synchronous for all time determinations with a specied stationary clock In agreement with experience we further assume the quantity 2AB t A tA c to be a universal constantthe velocity of light in empty space It is essential to have time dened by means of stationary clocks in the stationary system and the time now dened being appropriate to the stationary system we call it the time of the stationary system 2 On the Relativity of Lengths and Times The following reexions are based on the principle of relativity and on the principle of the constancy of the velocity of light These two principles we dene as follows 31 The laws by which the states of physical systems undergo change are not aected whether these changes of state be referred to the one or the other of two systems of coordinates in uniform translatory motion 2 Any ray of light moves in the stationary system of coordinates with the determined velocity c whether the ray be emitted by a stationary or by a moving body Hence velocity light path time interval where time interval is to be taken in the sense of the denition in 1 Let there be given a stationary rigid rod and let its length be l as measured by a measuringrod which is also stationary We now imagine the axis of the rod lying along the axis of x of the stationary system of coordinates and that a uniform motion of parallel translation with velocity v along the axis of x in the direction of increasing x is then imparted to the rod We now inquire as to the length of the moving rod and imagine its length to be ascertained by the following two operations a The observer moves together with the given measuringrod and the rod to be measured and measures the length of the rod directly by superposing the measuringrod in just the same way as if all three were at rest b By means of stationary clocks set up in the stationary system and syn chronizing in accordance with 1 the observer ascertains at what points of the stationary system the two ends of the rod to be measured are located at a denite time The distance between these two points measured by the measuringrod already employed which in this case is at rest is also a length which may be designated the length of the rod In accordance with the principle of relativity the length to be discovered by the operation awe will call it the length of the rod in the moving system must be equal to the length l of the stationary rod The length to be discovered by the operation b we will call the length of the moving rod in the stationary system This we shall determine on the basis of our two principles and we shall nd that it diers from l Current kinematics tacitly assumes that the lengths determined by these two operations are precisely equal or in other words that a moving rigid body at the epoch t may in geometrical respects be perfectly represented by the same body at rest in a denite position We imagine further that at the two ends A and B of the rod clocks are placed which synchronize with the clocks of the stationary system that is to say that their indications correspond at any instant to the time of the stationary system at the places where they happen to be These clocks are therefore synchronous in the stationary system We imagine further that with each clock there is a moving observer and that these observers apply to both clocks the criterion established in 1 for the synchronization of two clocks Let a ray of light depart from A at the time4 tA 4Time here denotes time of the stationary system and also position of hands of the moving clock situated at the place under discussion 4let it be reected at B at the time tB and reach A again at the time t A Taking into consideration the principle of the constancy of the velocity of light we nd that tB tA rAB c v and t A tB rAB c v where rAB denotes the length of the moving rodmeasured in the stationary system Observers moving with the moving rod would thus nd that the two clocks were not synchronous while observers in the stationary system would declare the clocks to be synchronous So we see that we cannot attach any absolute signication to the concept of simultaneity but that two events which viewed from a system of coordinates are simultaneous can no longer be looked upon as simultaneous events when envisaged from a system which is in motion relatively to that system 3 Theory of the Transformation of Coordinates and Times from a Stationary System to another System in Uniform Motion of Translation Relatively to the Former Let us in stationary space take two systems of coordinates ie two sys tems each of three rigid material lines perpendicular to one another and issuing from a point Let the axes of X of the two systems coincide and their axes of Y and Z respectively be parallel Let each system be provided with a rigid measuringrod and a number of clocks and let the two measuringrods and likewise all the clocks of the two systems be in all respects alike Now to the origin of one of the two systems k let a constant velocity v be imparted in the direction of the increasing x of the other stationary system K and let this velocity be communicated to the axes of the coordinates the relevant measuringrod and the clocks To any time of the stationary system K there then will correspond a denite position of the axes of the moving system and from reasons of symmetry we are entitled to assume that the motion of k may be such that the axes of the moving system are at the time t this t always denotes a time of the stationary system parallel to the axes of the stationary system We now imagine space to be measured from the stationary system K by means of the stationary measuringrod and also from the moving system k by means of the measuringrod moving with it and that we thus obtain the coordinates x y z and respectively Further let the time t of the stationary system be determined for all points thereof at which there are clocks by means of light signals in the manner indicated in 1 similarly let the time of the moving system be determined for all points of the moving system at which there are clocks at rest relatively to that system by applying the method given in 1 of light signals between the points at which the latter clocks are located To any system of values x y z t which completely denes the place and time of an event in the stationary system there belongs a system of values 5determining that event relatively to the system k and our task is now to nd the system of equations connecting these quantities In the rst place it is clear that the equations must be linear on account of the properties of homogeneity which we attribute to space and time If we place x x vt it is clear that a point at rest in the system k must have a system of values x y z independent of time We rst dene as a function of x y z and t To do this we have to express in equations that is nothing else than the summary of the data of clocks at rest in system k which have been synchronized according to the rule given in 1 From the origin of system k let a ray be emitted at the time 0 along the Xaxis to x and at the time 1 be reected thence to the origin of the co ordinates arriving there at the time 2 we then must have 1 20 2 1 or by inserting the arguments of the function and applying the principle of the constancy of the velocity of light in the stationary system 1 2 0 0 0 t 0 0 0 t x c v x c v x 0 0 t x c v Hence if x be chosen innitesimally small 1 2 1 c v 1 c v t x 1 c v t or x v c2 v2 t 0 It is to be noted that instead of the origin of the coordinates we might have chosen any other point for the point of origin of the ray and the equation just obtained is therefore valid for all values of x y z An analogous considerationapplied to the axes of Y and Zit being borne in mind that light is always propagated along these axes when viewed from the stationary system with the velocity c2 v2 gives us y 0 z 0 Since is a linear function it follows from these equations that a t v c2 v2 x where a is a function v at present unknown and where for brevity it is assumed that at the origin of k 0 when t 0 With the help of this result we easily determine the quantities by expressing in equations that light as required by the principle of the constancy of the velocity of light in combination with the principle of relativity is also 6propagated with velocity c when measured in the moving system For a ray of light emitted at the time 0 in the direction of the increasing c or ac t v c2 v2 x But the ray moves relatively to the initial point of k when measured in the stationary system with the velocity c v so that x c v t If we insert this value of t in the equation for we obtain a c2 c2 v2 x In an analogous manner we nd by considering rays moving along the two other axes that c ac t v c2 v2 x when y c2 v2 t x 0 Thus a c c2 v2 y and a c c2 v2 z Substituting for x its value we obtain vt vxc2 vx vt vy vz where 1 p 1 v2c2 and is an as yet unknown function of v If no assumption whatever be made as to the initial position of the moving system and as to the zero point of an additive constant is to be placed on the right side of each of these equations 7We now have to prove that any ray of light measured in the moving system is propagated with the velocity c if as we have assumed this is the case in the stationary system for we have not as yet furnished the proof that the principle of the constancy of the velocity of light is compatible with the principle of relativity At the time t 0 when the origin of the coordinates is common to the two systems let a spherical wave be emitted therefrom and be propagated with the velocity c in system K If x y z be a point just attained by this wave then x2 y2 z2 c2t2 Transforming this equation with the aid of our equations of transformation we obtain after a simple calculation 2 2 2 c2 2 The wave under consideration is therefore no less a spherical wave with velocity of propagation c when viewed in the moving system This shows that our two fundamental principles are compatible5 In the equations of transformation which have been developed there enters an unknown function of v which we will now determine For this purpose we introduce a third system of coordinates K which rel atively to the system k is in a state of parallel translatory motion parallel to the axis of such that the origin of coordinates of system K moves with velocity v on the axis of At the time t 0 let all three origins coincide and when t x y z 0 let the time t of the system K be zero We call the coordinates measured in the system K x y z and by a twofold application of our equations of transformation we obtain t vv vc2 vvt x vv v vvx y v vvy z v vvz Since the relations between x y z and x y z do not contain the time t the systems K and K are at rest with respect to one another and it is clear that the transformation from K to K must be the identical transformation Thus vv 1 5The equations of the Lorentz transformation may be more simply deduced directly from the condition that in virtue of those equations the relation x2 y2 z2 c2t2 shall have as its consequence the second relation 2 2 2 c2 2 Editors note In Einsteins original paper the symbols H Z for the coordinates of the moving system k were introduced without explicitly dening them In the 1923 English translation X Y Z were used creating an ambiguity between X coordinates in the xed system K and the parallel axis in moving system k Here and in subsequent references we use when referring to the axis of system k along which the system is translating with respect to K In addition the reference to system K later in this sentence was incorrectly given as k in the 1923 English translation 8We now inquire into the signication of v We give our attention to that part of the axis of Y of system k which lies between 0 0 0 and 0 l 0 This part of the axis of Y is a rod moving perpendicularly to its axis with velocity v relatively to system K Its ends possess in K the coordinates x1 vt y1 l v z1 0 and x2 vt y2 0 z2 0 The length of the rod measured in K is therefore lv and this gives us the meaning of the function v From reasons of symmetry it is now evident that the length of a given rod moving perpendicularly to its axis measured in the stationary system must depend only on the velocity and not on the direction and the sense of the motion The length of the moving rod measured in the stationary system does not change therefore if v and v are interchanged Hence follows that lv lv or v v It follows from this relation and the one previously found that v 1 so that the transformation equations which have been found become t vxc2 x vt y z where 1 p 1 v2c2 4 Physical Meaning of the Equations Obtained in Respect to Moving Rigid Bodies and Moving Clocks We envisage a rigid sphere6 of radius R at rest relatively to the moving system k and with its centre at the origin of coordinates of k The equation of the surface of this sphere moving relatively to the system K with velocity v is 2 2 2 R2 6That is a body possessing spherical form when examined at rest 9The equation of this surface expressed in x y z at the time t 0 is x2 p 1 v2c22 y2 z2 R2 A rigid body which measured in a state of rest has the form of a sphere therefore has in a state of motionviewed from the stationary systemthe form of an ellipsoid of revolution with the axes R p 1 v2c2 R R Thus whereas the Y and Z dimensions of the sphere and therefore of every rigid body of no matter what form do not appear modied by the motion the X dimension appears shortened in the ratio 1 p 1 v2c2 ie the greater the value of v the greater the shortening For v c all moving objectsviewed from the stationary systemshrivel up into plane gures For velocities greater than that of light our deliberations become meaningless we shall however nd in what follows that the velocity of light in our theory plays the part physically of an innitely great velocity It is clear that the same results hold good of bodies at rest in the stationary system viewed from a system in uniform motion Further we imagine one of the clocks which are qualied to mark the time t when at rest relatively to the stationary system and the time when at rest relatively to the moving system to be located at the origin of the coordinates of k and so adjusted that it marks the time What is the rate of this clock when viewed from the stationary system Between the quantities x t and which refer to the position of the clock we have evidently x vt and 1 p 1 v2c2 t vxc2 Therefore t p 1 v2c2 t 1 p 1 v2c2t whence it follows that the time marked by the clock viewed in the stationary system is slow by 1 p 1 v2c2 seconds per second orneglecting magni tudes of fourth and higher orderby 1 2v2c2 From this there ensues the following peculiar consequence If at the points A and B of K there are stationary clocks which viewed in the stationary system are synchronous and if the clock at A is moved with the velocity v along the line AB to B then on its arrival at B the two clocks no longer synchronize but the clock moved from A to B lags behind the other which has remained at Editors note In the 1923 English translation this phrase was erroneously translated as plain gures I have used the correct plane gures in this edition 10B by 1 2tv2c2 up to magnitudes of fourth and higher order t being the time occupied in the journey from A to B It is at once apparent that this result still holds good if the clock moves from A to B in any polygonal line and also when the points A and B coincide If we assume that the result proved for a polygonal line is also valid for a continuously curved line we arrive at this result If one of two synchronous clocks at A is moved in a closed curve with constant velocity until it returns to A the journey lasting t seconds then by the clock which has remained at rest the travelled clock on its arrival at A will be 1 2tv2c2 second slow Thence we conclude that a balanceclock7 at the equator must go more slowly by a very small amount than a precisely similar clock situated at one of the poles under otherwise identical conditions 5 The Composition of Velocities In the system k moving along the axis of X of the system K with velocity v let a point move in accordance with the equations w w 0 where w and w denote constants Required the motion of the point relatively to the system K If with the help of the equations of transformation developed in 3 we introduce the quantities x y z t into the equations of motion of the point we obtain x w v 1 vwc2 t y p 1 v2c2 1 vwc2 wt z 0 Thus the law of the parallelogram of velocities is valid according to our theory only to a rst approximation We set V 2 dx dt 2 dy dt 2 w2 w2 w2 a tan1 ww 7Not a pendulumclock which is physically a system to which the Earth belongs This case had to be excluded Editors note This equation was incorrectly given in Einsteins original paper and the 1923 English translation as a tan1 wywx 11a is then to be looked upon as the angle between the velocities v and w After a simple calculation we obtain V p v2 w2 2vw cos a vw sin ac2 1 vw cos ac2 It is worthy of remark that v and w enter into the expression for the resultant velocity in a symmetrical manner If w also has the direction of the axis of X we get V v w 1 vwc2 It follows from this equation that from a composition of two velocities which are less than c there always results a velocity less than c For if we set v c w c and being positive and less than c then V c 2c 2c c c It follows further that the velocity of light c cannot be altered by compo sition with a velocity less than that of light For this case we obtain V c w 1 wc c We might also have obtained the formula for V for the case when v and w have the same direction by compounding two transformations in accordance with 3 If in addition to the systems K and k guring in 3 we introduce still another system of coordinates k moving parallel to k its initial point moving on the axis of with the velocity w we obtain equations between the quantities x y z t and the corresponding quantities of k which dier from the equations found in 3 only in that the place of v is taken by the quantity v w 1 vwc2 from which we see that such parallel transformationsnecessarilyform a group We have now deduced the requisite laws of the theory of kinematics cor responding to our two principles and we proceed to show their application to electrodynamics II ELECTRODYNAMICAL PART 6 Transformation of the MaxwellHertz Equations for Empty Space On the Nature of the Electromotive Forces Occurring in a Magnetic Field During Motion Let the MaxwellHertz equations for empty space hold good for the station ary system K so that we have Editors note X in the 1923 English translation 121 c X t N y M z 1 c L t Y z Z y 1 c Y t L z N x 1 c M t Z x X z 1 c Z t M x L y 1 c N t X y Y x where X Y Z denotes the vector of the electric force and L M N that of the magnetic force If we apply to these equations the transformation developed in 3 by re ferring the electromagnetic processes to the system of coordinates there intro duced moving with the velocity v we obtain the equations 1 c X n N v cY o n M v cZ o 1 c n Y v cN o L n N v cY o 1 c n Z v cM o n M v cZ o L 1 c L n Y v cN o n Z v cM o 1 c n M v cZ o n Z v cM o X 1 c n N v cY o X n Y v cN o where 1 p 1 v2c2 Now the principle of relativity requires that if the MaxwellHertz equations for empty space hold good in system K they also hold good in system k that is to say that the vectors of the electric and the magnetic forceX Y Z and L M Nof the moving system k which are dened by their pondero motive eects on electric or magnetic masses respectively satisfy the following equations 1 c X N M 1 c L Y Z 1 c Y L N 1 c M Z X 1 c Z M L 1 c N X Y Editors note In the 1923 English translation the quantities and were interchanged in the second equation They were given correctly in the the original 1905 paper 13Evidently the two systems of equations found for system k must express exactly the same thing since both systems of equations are equivalent to the MaxwellHertz equations for system K Since further the equations of the two systems agree with the exception of the symbols for the vectors it follows that the functions occurring in the systems of equations at corresponding places must agree with the exception of a factor v which is common for all functions of the one system of equations and is independent of and but depends upon v Thus we have the relations X vX L vL Y vvc is equal to the vectorproduct of the velocity of the charge and the magnetic force divided by the velocity of light Old manner of expression 2 If a unit electric point charge is in motion in an electromagnetic eld the force acting upon it is equal to the electric force which is present at the locality of the charge and which we ascertain by transformation of the eld to a system of coordinates at rest relatively to the electrical charge New manner of expression The analogy holds with magnetomotive forces We see that electromotive force plays in the developed theory merely the part of an auxiliary concept which owes its introduction to the circumstance that electric and magnetic forces do not exist independently of the state of motion of the system of coordinates Furthermore it is clear that the asymmetry mentioned in the introduction as arising when we consider the currents produced by the relative motion of a magnet and a conductor now disappears Moreover questions as to the seat of electrodynamic electromotive forces unipolar machines now have no point 7 Theory of Dopplers Principle and of Aberration In the system K very far from the origin of coordinates let there be a source of electrodynamic waves which in a part of space containing the origin of coordinates may be represented to a sucient degree of approximation by the equations X X0 sin L L0 sin Y Y0 sin M M0 sin Z Z0 sin N N0 sin where t 1 c lx my nz Here X0 Y0 Z0 and L0 M0 N0 are the vectors dening the amplitude of the wavetrain and l m n the directioncosines of the wavenormals We wish to know the constitution of these waves when they are examined by an observer at rest in the moving system k Applying the equations of transformation found in 6 for electric and mag netic forces and those found in 3 for the coordinates and the time we obtain directly X X0 sin L L0 sin Y Y0 vN0c sin M M0 vZ0c sin Z Z0 vM0c sin N N0 vY0c sin 1 cl m n where 151 lvc l l vc 1 lvc m m 1 lvc n n 1 lvc From the equation for it follows that if an observer is moving with velocity v relatively to an innitely distant source of light of frequency in such a way that the connecting line sourceobserver makes the angle with the velocity of the observer referred to a system of coordinates which is at rest relatively to the source of light the frequency of the light perceived by the observer is given by the equation 1 cos vc p 1 v2c2 This is Dopplers principle for any velocities whatever When 0 the equation assumes the perspicuous form s 1 vc 1 vc We see that in contrast with the customary view when v c If we call the angle between the wavenormal direction of the ray in the moving system and the connecting line sourceobserver the equation for assumes the form cos cos vc 1 cos vc This equation expresses the law of aberration in its most general form If 1 2 the equation becomes simply cos vc We still have to nd the amplitude of the waves as it appears in the moving system If we call the amplitude of the electric or magnetic force A or A respectively accordingly as it is measured in the stationary system or in the moving system we obtain Editors note Erroneously given as l in the 1923 English translation propagating an error despite a change in symbols from the original 1905 paper 16A2 A2 1 cos vc2 1 v2c2 which equation if 0 simplies into A2 A2 1 vc 1 vc It follows from these results that to an observer approaching a source of light with the velocity c this source of light must appear of innite intensity 8 Transformation of the Energy of Light Rays Theory of the Pressure of Radiation Exerted on Perfect Reectors Since A28 equals the energy of light per unit of volume we have to regard A28 by the principle of relativity as the energy of light in the moving system Thus A2A2 would be the ratio of the measured in motion to the measured at rest energy of a given light complex if the volume of a light complex were the same whether measured in K or in k But this is not the case If l m n are the directioncosines of the wavenormals of the light in the stationary system no energy passes through the surface elements of a spherical surface moving with the velocity of light x lct2 y mct2 z nct2 R2 We may therefore say that this surface permanently encloses the same light complex We inquire as to the quantity of energy enclosed by this surface viewed in system k that is as to the energy of the light complex relatively to the system k The spherical surfaceviewed in the moving systemis an ellipsoidal sur face the equation for which at the time 0 is lvc2 mvc2 nvc2 R2 If S is the volume of the sphere and S that of this ellipsoid then by a simple calculation S S p 1 v2c2 1 cos vc Thus if we call the light energy enclosed by this surface E when it is measured in the stationary system and E when measured in the moving system we obtain E E A2S A2S 1 cos vc p 1 v2c2 and this formula when 0 simplies into 17E E s 1 vc 1 vc It is remarkable that the energy and the frequency of a light complex vary with the state of motion of the observer in accordance with the same law Now let the coordinate plane 0 be a perfectly reecting surface at which the plane waves considered in 7 are reected We seek for the pressure of light exerted on the reecting surface and for the direction frequency and intensity of the light after reexion Let the incidental light be dened by the quantities A cos referred to system K Viewed from k the corresponding quantities are A A1 cos vc p 1 v2c2 cos cos vc 1 cos vc 1 cos vc p 1 v2c2 For the reected light referring the process to system k we obtain A A cos cos Finally by transforming back to the stationary system K we obtain for the reected light A A 1 cos vc p 1 v2c2 A1 2 cos vc v2c2 1 v2c2 cos cos vc 1 cos vc 1 v2c2 cos 2vc 1 2 cos vc v2c2 1 cos vc p 1 v2c2 1 2 cos vc v2c2 1 v2c2 The energy measured in the stationary system which is incident upon unit area of the mirror in unit time is evidently A2c cos v8 The energy leaving the unit of surface of the mirror in the unit of time is A2c cos v8 18The dierence of these two expressions is by the principle of energy the work done by the pressure of light in the unit of time If we set down this work as equal to the product Pv where P is the pressure of light we obtain P 2 A2 8 cos vc2 1 v2c2 In agreement with experiment and with other theories we obtain to a rst approximation P 2 A2 8 cos2 All problems in the optics of moving bodies can be solved by the method here employed What is essential is that the electric and magnetic force of the light which is inuenced by a moving body be transformed into a system of coordinates at rest relatively to the body By this means all problems in the optics of moving bodies will be reduced to a series of problems in the optics of stationary bodies 9 Transformation of the MaxwellHertz Equations when ConvectionCurrents are Taken into Account We start from the equations 1 c nX t ux o N y M z 1 c L t Y z

the electric charges to be invariably coupled to small rigid bodies ions electrons these equations are the electromagnetic basis of the Lorentzian electrodynamics and optics of moving bodies Let these equations be valid in the system K and transform them with the assistance of the equations of transformation given in 3 and 6 to the system k We then obtain the equations 191 c nX uo N M 1 c L Y Z 1 c nY uo L N 1 c M Z X 1 c nZ uo M L 1 c N X Y where u ux v 1 uxvc2 u uy 1 uxvc2 u uz 1 uxvc2 and X Y Z 1 uxvc2 Sinceas follows from the theorem of addition of velocities 5the vector u u u is nothing else than the velocity of the electric charge measured in the system k we have the proof that on the basis of our kinematical principles the electrodynamic foundation of Lorentzs theory of the electrodynamics of moving bodies is in agreement with the principle of relativity In addition I may briey remark that the following important law may easily be deduced from the developed equations If an electrically charged body is in motion anywhere in space without altering its charge when regarded from a system of coordinates moving with the body its charge also remainswhen regarded from the stationary system Kconstant 10 Dynamics of the Slowly Accelerated Electron Let there be in motion in an electromagnetic eld an electrically charged particle in the sequel called an electron for the law of motion of which we assume as follows If the electron is at rest at a given epoch the motion of the electron ensues in the next instant of time according to the equations 20md2x dt2 X md2y dt2 Y md2z dt2 Z where x y z denote the coordinates of the electron and m the mass of the electron as long as its motion is slow Now secondly let the velocity of the electron at a given epoch be v We seek the law of motion of the electron in the immediately ensuing instants of time Without aecting the general character of our considerations we may and will assume that the electron at the moment when we give it our attention is at the origin of the coordinates and moves with the velocity v along the axis of X of the system K It is then clear that at the given moment t 0 the electron is at rest relatively to a system of coordinates which is in parallel motion with velocity v along the axis of X From the above assumption in combination with the principle of relativity it is clear that in the immediately ensuing time for small values of t the electron viewed from the system k moves in accordance with the equations m d2 d 2 X md2 d 2 Y md2 d 2 Z in which the symbols X Y Z refer to the system k If further we decide that when t x y z 0 then 0 the transformation equations of 3 and 6 hold good so that we have x vt y z t vxc2 X X Y Y vNc Z Z vMc With the help of these equations we transform the above equations of motion from system k to system K and obtain d2x dt2 m3 X d2y dt2 mTaking the ordinary point of view we now inquire as to the longitudinal and the transverse mass of the moving electron We write the equations A in the form m3 d2x dt2 X X m2 d2y dt2mc2 1 p 1 v2c2 1 Thus when v c W becomes innite Velocities greater than that of light haveas in our previous resultsno possibility of existence This expression for the kinetic energy must also by virtue of the argument stated above apply to ponderable masses as well We will now enumerate the properties of the motion of the electron which result from the system of equations A and are accessible to experiment 1 From the second equation of the system A it follows that an electric force Y and a magnetic force N have an equally strong deective action on an electron moving with the velocity v when Y Nvc Thus we see that it is possible by our theory to determine the velocity of the electron from the ratio of the magnetic power of deexion Am to the electric power of deexion Ae for any velocity by applying the law Am Ae v c This relationship may be tested experimentally since the velocity of the electron can be directly measured eg by means of rapidly oscillating electric and magnetic elds 2 From the deduction for the kinetic energy of the electron it follows that between the potential dierence P traversed and the acquired velocity v of the electron there must be the relationship P Z Xdx m c2 1 p 1 v2c2 1 3 We calculate the radius of curvature of the path of the electron when a magnetic force N is present as the only deective force acting perpendicularly to the velocity of the electron From the second of the equations A we obtain d2y dt2 v2 R m v c N r 1 v2 c2 or R mc2 vc p 1 v2c2 1 N These three relationships are a complete expression for the laws according to which by the theory here advanced the electron must move In conclusion I wish to say that in working at the problem here dealt with I have had the loyal assistance of my friend and colleague M Besso and that I am indebted to him for several valuable suggestions 23About this Document This edition of Einsteins On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies is based on the English translation of his original 1905 Germanlanguage paper published as Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter Korper in Annalen der Physik 17891 1905 which appeared in the book The Principle of Relativity pub lished in 1923 by Methuen and Company Ltd of London Most of the papers in that collection are English translations from the German Das Rela tivatsprinzip 4th ed published by in 1922 by Tuebner All of these sources are now in the public domain this document derived from them remains in the public domain and may be reproduced in any manner or medium without permission restriction attribution or compensation Numbered footnotes are as they appeared in the 1923 edition editors notes are marked by a dagger and appear in sans serif type The 1923 English translation modied the notation used in Einsteins 1905 paper to conform to that in use by the 1920s for example c denotes the speed of light as opposed the V used by Einstein in 1905 This edition was prepared by John Walker The current version of this document is available in a variety of formats from the editors Web site httpwwwfourmilabch 24
