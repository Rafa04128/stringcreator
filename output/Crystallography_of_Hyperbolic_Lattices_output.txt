Astrophysics University of Wurzburg Am Hubland D97074 Wurzburg Germany Hyperbolic lattices are a revolutionary platform for tabletop simulations of holography and quan tum physics in curved space and facilitate ecient quantum error correcting codes Their underlying geometry is nonEuclidean and the absence of Blochs theorem precludes the straightforward ap plication of the often indispensable energy band theory to study model Hamiltonians on hyperbolic lattices Motivated by recent insights into hyperbolic band theory we initiate a crystallography of hyperbolic lattices We show that many hyperbolic lattices feature a hidden crystal structure characterized by unit cells hyperbolic Bravais lattices and associated symmetry groups Using the mathematical framework of highergenus Riemann surfaces and Fuchsian groups we derive for the rst time a list of example hyperbolic p q lattices and their hyperbolic Bravais lattices including ve innite families and several graphs relevant for experiments in circuit quantum electrodynamics and topolectrical circuits This dramatically simplies the computation of energy spectra of tight binding Hamiltonians on hyperbolic lattices from exact diagonalization on the graph to solving a nite set of equations in terms of irreducible representations The signicance of this achievement needs to be compared to the allimportant role played by conventional Euclidean crystallography in the study of solids We exemplify the high potential of this approach by constructing and diago nalizing nitedimensional Bloch wave Hamiltonians Our work lays the foundation for generalizing some of the most powerful concepts of solid state physics crystal momentum and Brillouin zone to the emerging eld of hyperbolic lattices and tabletop simulations of gravitational theories and reveals the connections to concepts from topology and algebraic geometry Hyperbolic geometry plays a paramount role at the frontier of both theoretical and experimental physics It underlies holographic descriptions of strongly coupled systems and models for quantum chaos quantum grav ity and quantum entanglement 14 It is fundamental to modern computational manybody techniques 511 and forms the basis for powerful quantum error correct ing codes 1216 Recent experimental realizations of hyperbolic lattices 1719 in circuit quantum electrody namics QED 2024 and topolectrical circuits 2530 have set the stage for the quantum simulation of curved space physics using discrete geometries 3142 The cor responding nonEuclidean graphs are suited to be imple mented in various other topological photonics platforms 43 These cuttingedge eorts complement important previous experimental simulations of curved space using optical metamaterials 4450 ultracold quantum gases 5161 electromagnetic waveguides 62 trapped ions 63 and other platforms 64 65 Stimulated by these intimate connections to outstand ing open problems in physics strong interest in the properties of hyperbolic space resurged in the last two iboettchualbertaca decades However while many important results have been obtained since the 19th century 6670 several crit ical questions about hyperbolic space that are relevant to physicists remain unanswered Most strikingly per haps due to the absence of Blochs theorem the energy spectrum of a single particle hopping on a hyperbolic lat tice can only be obtained by exact numerical diagonaliza tion of the Hamiltonian This preempts any treatment of macroscopically large systems even in the noninteract ing limit One way around this issue is to concentrate on longwavelength excitations where a continuum ap proximation can capture several features of the discrete spectrum 33 To also resolve excitations with higher en ergies an alternative approach is to study Bloch waves on hyperbolic tessellations which leads to the hyperbolic band theory of Ref 37 In order to develop a complete band structure theory for hyperbolic lattices that can capture all singleparticle eigenstates on the other hand it is mandatory to rst identify the crystallographic sym metries of the lattice and then construct wavefunctions from their representations 71 In this work we address the rst part of the problem and outline a Bloch wave theory to answer aspects of the second part The hyperbolic lattices we consider are of p q type which means that they are tessellations of the plane by arXiv210501087v2 condmatstrel 17 Jan 20222 FIG 1 We consider p q lattices which are made from reg ular pgons such that the coordination number of each lattice site is q The wellknown triangular 3 6 square 4 4 and hexagonal 6 3 lattices rst row constitute tessella tions of the Euclidean plane Hyperbolic lattices dened by p 2q 2 4 are tessellations of the hyperbolic plane of constant negative curvature We show three examples second row with hyperbolic space represented by the Poincare disk model reviewed in Sec I where the nonEuclidean metric is such that the distance between any two neighboring sites in a hyperbolic lattice is equal Lattice sites are connected by geodesic lines which are circular arcs that when extended intersect the disk boundary orthogonally The circular nature of geodesics in the 7 3 and 8 3 lattices is less easily visible compared to the 8 4 lattice but nonetheless present regular pgons such that each lattice site has coordina tion number q For p 2q 2 4 such lattices are tilings of the Euclidean plane by regular polygons which can only be achieved by triangles squares and hexagons corresponding to the solutions 3 6 4 4 and 6 3 see Fig 1 On the other hand for p 2q 2 4 we obtain a tessellation of the hyperbolic plane which we call a hyperbolic lattice Some examples are shown in Fig 1 Obviously there are innitely many integer solu tions p and q to this inequality implying striking lattice properties For instance hyperbolic lattices can have any pfold rotation symmetry in stark contrast to Euclidean lattices The high connectivity of such lattices also im plies that their number of sites grows exponentially in the graph diameter which is the shortest number of steps to get from one end of the lattice to the other To embed these lattices into hyperbolic space ie assign a complex coordinate to each lattice site we use the Poincare disk model which is reviewed in Sec I The immense value of crystallography in the theory of solids stems from the ability to utilize crystal symmetries to divide macroscopic numbers of lattice sites into unit cells that are arranged in a wellknown manner in a Bra vais lattice In fact in a bottomup approach we may construct every twodimensional Euclidean lattice from FIG 2 In this work we develop the formalism how to apply the crystallographic notions of unit cell and Bravais lattice to hyperbolic lattices Here we give an example Top left The unit cell of the 10 3 lattice consists of ten lattice sites marked red The associated analogue of the WignerSeitz cell or fundamental domain is the decagon of the 10 5 lattice shown in orange Bottom left Therefore the 10 5 lattice constitutes the Bravais lattice of the 10 3 lattice Right By lling the decagons of the 10 5 lattice with the ten sites of the unit cell we obtain all sites of the 10 3 lattice a nite set of points z1 zN called the unit cell which is repeated periodically in a Bravais lattice speci ed by two primitive translation vectors a1 and a2 We are restricting ourselves to symmorphic space groups here for simplicity Every lattice site is then uniquely dened by a pair of numbers a n where a 1 N is the position inside the unit cell and n n1 n2 Z2 lo cates the unit cell within the Bravais lattice at position n1a1 n2a2 An analogous construction applies to Eu clidean lattices in higher dimensions and it is a famous result that the number of distinct Euclidean Bravais lat tices is nite in every dimension In two and three dimen sions there are 5 and 14 Bravais lattices respectively Once the unit cell and Bravais lattice of a given Eu clidean lattice are identied the singleparticle eigen states can be constructed from representations of the translation operators Tn of the Bravais lattice mapping the origin to n1a1 n2a2 Due to Blochs theorem all of these representations are onedimensional and labeled by crystal momenta q q1 q2 which have as many components as there are primitive translation vectors yielding N energy bands It is important to realize that Blochs theorem although convenient in the construction of the eigenstates is not a necessary piece If the trans lations Tn were not mutually commuting then their rep resentations would not all be onedimensional Still we could nd these representations label them by certain quantum numbers and use this structure to construct N energy bands A wellknown example is of course the3 eigenstates of a particle in a threedimensional spheri cally symmetric potential where states are labeled by the usual quantum numbers n m with the dimension of each eigenspace or representation being 2 1 since threedimensional rotations generally do not commute In order to solve the spectral problem for hyperbolic lattices it is therefore crucial to rst generalize the con cepts of unit cell and Bravais lattice to hyperbolic lat tices Only as the second step we need to worry about the representations of the generators of the Bravais lat tice It may not be obvious that the rst step can be taken at all The central result of this work is to provide for the rst time a comprehensive list of innitely many and experimentally relevant examples of p q lattices with their unit cells and corresponding Bravais lattices In Fig 2 we illuminate the example of the 10 3 lattice with a unit cell of ten sites whose Bravais lattice is the 10 5 lattice As expected the generators of the hyper bolic Bravais lattice which are constructed explicitly in Sec III C do not commute More examples of p q lat tices and their unit cells and Bravais lattices are collected in Tables III and IV Finally let us have a glimpse at the Bloch wave band structure that is implied by the crystallography presented in this work The tightbinding Hamiltonian we would like to diagonalize is H ij Aija iaj 1 where the sum runs over the sites of the lattice a i is the creation operator of a particle at site i and Aij is the adjacency matrix of the hyperbolic lattice A is the matrix with entry 1 if i and j are connected by an edge and zero otherwise Following the idea of Ref 37 we further assume that some eigenstates transform as onedimensional representations under the generators of the Bravais lattice and therefore are simply Bloch waves Roughly speaking when going from one unit cell to the other Bloch waves kzi pick up a phase factor eik see Fig 3 for an illustration on the example of the 10 3 lattice discussed earlier The number of indepen dent momentum components of such a Bloch wave is 2g where g 2 is the unique genus of a Riemann surface that can be covered by the fundamental domain see Sec III Projecting the operator ai to the space spanned by Bloch waves we arrive at the problem of diagonalizing the Bloch wave Hamiltonian HBW k N aa1 Aaaka kaaka 2 with Ak the N N adjacency matrix of the unit cell endowed with periodic boundary conditions whose edges are labeled by entries 1 and eik in a wellspecied man ner The eigenvalues of the matrix Ak yield N energy bands that constitute the Bloch wave spectrum of the given p q lattice An example band structure is shown FIG 3 In hyperbolic band theory Bloch waves pick up a phase factor eik when going from one unit cell to the other or equivalently when traversing the boundary of the fundamental domain Left Continuing the example of the 10 3 lattice from Fig 2 we endow the unit cell with peri odic boundary conditions and obtain a graph with ten sites and coordination number 3 red circles The ten edges of the fundamental domain orange give rise to ve naive mo mentum components k1 k2 k3 k4 k5 only four of which are independent A similar redundancy occurs in the Eu clidean hexagonal lattice see Sec III B Right We show the band structure of the associated Bloch wave Hamilto nian in fourdimensional momentum space along the k k1 k2 k3 k4T k1 1 1 1T direction as a function of k Strikingly position space and momentum space do not have the same dimension for hyperbolic Bloch waves in Fig 3 with the corresponding matrix Ak given by Eq 60 The construction of Bloch wave Hamiltonians and their spectra are discussed in Sec V B We emphasize that every Bloch wave is a solution to the tightbinding problem on the hyperbolic lattice and thus yields a valid eigenenergy We merely lack the in formation on the fraction of eigenstates that transform under a higherdimensional representation Some rst steps towards a complete classication of irreducible rep resentations and hence a Bloch theorem for hyperbolic Bravais lattices have been taken in Ref 72 for nite pat terns of 8 8 type One remarkable nding is that for many choices of such nite patterns all irreducible rep resentations are onedimensional and hence Bloch wave theory is exact On the other hand instances where twodimensional representations play a role could also be identied The main result of this paper is to provide a concrete list of example p q lattices with their unit cells and Bravais lattices including several cases for genus g 2 3 and ve innite families To the best of our knowledge no such list has been collected before and we are con vinced that it will fundamentally alter the perspective on hyperbolic lattices in future theoretical and experimen tal work We give a comprehensive introduction to the mathematical toolbox required to work with hyperbolic crystallography in practice We expect these concepts from topology and geometry although covered in math4 ematics textbooks to be less known to the wider physics community In particular our construction is strongly built on the notion of patterns on highergenus Riemann surfaces from Ref 73 Our identication of hyperbolic Bravais lattices parallels the study of periodic boundary conditions on the hyperbolic plane of Ref 74 This paper is organized as follows We rst review hy perbolic geometry and the Poincare disk model in Sec I We then discuss the notion of patterns on highergenus Riemann surfaces in Sec II which in particular allows us to identify all potential regular hyperbolic Bravais lat tices In Sec III we construct the generators of hyper bolic Bravais lattices and study the associated Fuchsian groups In Sec IV we discuss a selection of p q lat tices with their unit cells and Bravais lattices In Sec V we apply our ndings to tightbinding Hamiltonians on innite hyperbolic lattices In App A we describe a method to eciently generate large lattices Further technical details are collected in Apps BE and refer enced in the main text I HYPERBOLIC GEOMETRY In this section we introduce the Poincare disk model of hyperbolic space and discuss its distance preserving maps Using hyperbolic trigonometry we construct reg ular hyperbolic polygons which are the basic building block of our crystallography For the study of hyperbolic lattices we employ the Poincare disk model of hyperbolic space 1 69 which consists of all points in the unit disk D z C z 1 equipped with the hyperbolic metric ds2 22 dx2 dy2 1 z22 3 Herein is the curvature radius which sets the rele vant length scale in hyperbolic space The corresponding constant negative curvature is K 2 We denote z x iy rei The hyperbolic distance between two points z z D is given by dz z arcosh 1 2z z2 1 z21 z2 4 The angle between two intersecting lines in D is given by the usual Euclidean angle The geodesics of the Poincare disk model are circular arcs that intersect the boundary of D orthogonally This includes straight lines through the origin The isometries of D are the maps that preserve the hyperbolic distance They may either preserve or change orientation The orientation preserving ones are given by fractional linear transformations z Mz az b bz a 5 with complex numbers a and b satisfying a2 b2 1 Identifying M with the SU1 1matrix M a b b a 6 the orientation preservingmaps form the group P PSU1 1 SU1 11 7 In the following we denote the unit element of P by 1P The statement X 1P means X 1 in the two dimensional representation of Eq 6 Note that if we embedded the hyperbolic lattice into the Poincare upper half plane H instead the group of orientation preserving isometries would be PSL2 R which is isomorphic to P A typical orientation reversing map in the plane is given by complex conjugation z z The group of all orientation reversing isometries of D is given by linear fractional transformations z az b bz a 8 and so is also isomorphic to P Thus every isometry of the Poincare disk can be uniquely decomposed into an orientationpreserving one that is either combined or not combined with the map z z Formally the full isometry group of D is therefore the semidirect prod uct P Z2 An analogous but potentially more famil iar situation arises for the Euclidean orthogonal group O2 SO2 Z2 as every element from O2 can be uniquely written as a proper rotation from SO2 that is either combined or not combined with a reec tion x y x y The central building blocks of the crystallography pre sented in this work are regular geodesic polygons A polygon is called regular if its internal angles are equal and its side lengths are equal It is called geodesic if its vertices are connected by uniquely determined geodesic lines The circumradius or simply radius hereafter of the polygon is the distance from the center to any of its vertices In the Euclidean plane the internal angles of a regular pgon sum up to p 2 whereas the radius can be of arbitrary size In contrast in the Poincare disk the internal angles can have any value as long as they sum up to a number smaller than p 2 while the radius is uniquely determined by the values of the angles Generally smaller internal angles imply larger radii An extreme example is a polygon with all internal angles approaching zero so that the vertices of this poly gon approach the boundary of D In the p q lattice the internal angles of each pgon are 2q Consequently to give another useful example a decagon in the 10 3 lattice has smaller radius and thus smaller area than a decagon in the 10 5 lattice as can be seen in Fig 2 We now compute the characteristic lengths of regular pgons in p q lattices It is important to notice that we can express lengths either in terms of hyperbolic dis tances given by Eq 4 with the natural unit of length5 being or in terms of their coordinates in the Poincare disk with the natural length scale given by the disk ra dius which we set to unity Denote the vertices of the polygon by zj r0ei2jp j 1 p with an arbitrary phase Then the radius r0 of the polygon in units of the disk radius is given by r0 cos p q cos p q 9 The corresponding hyperbolic radius is C dr0 0 Two other lengths of interest are the shortest hyperbolic distance from the center of the polygon to an edge de noted A and the hyperbolic side length denoted 2B see Fig 4 Then A B C form a hyperbolic right triangle with internal angles p q and 2 and the rules of hyperbolic trigonometry yield the relations cos p tanhA tanhC 10 sin p sinhB sinhC 11 If the polygon is oriented such that A lies along the pos itive real axis and accordingly z1 r0eip is the rst vertex then Eq 10 implies that the edge intersects the positive real axis at a real coordinate a D with A da 0 determined by cos p tanh2 artanha tanh2 artanhr0 12 Note that tanh2 artanhx 2x1 x2 Equations 1012 reproduce the Euclidean result for a r0 1 because the hyperbolic metric in Eq 3 becomes at for z 1 We conclude this section with a parametrization of the geodesic arcs that comprise the edges of a regular hyper bolic pgon Denote the p sides by C c eiei21p 0 0 13 with 1 p The parameters c 0 are determined by c a and cei0 z1 r0eip This is solved by a2 2ar0 cosp r2 0 2r0 cosp 2a 14 c a sin0 r0 sinp 15 The value of the internal angles 2q is arbitrary and enters through r0 In principle q could be noninteger valued although this situation does not arise in the ap plications considered here The formulas derived in this section are also valid for odd values of p say for a regular hyperbolic 7gon C B A FIG 4 Regular hyperbolic polygon exemplied here by the central octagon of the p q 8 8 lattice The hyperbolic lengths A B C enclose a right triangle with interior angles p red shaded 2 and q They obey the relations of hyperbolic trigonometry in Eqs 10 and 11 The Euclidean distance between the origin and the vertices is r0 from Eq 9 with C dr0 0 The polygon intersects the positive real axis orthogonally at a D with a given by Eq 12 and A da 0 The orange lines are parametrized by Eq 13 II PATTERNS In this section we discuss the concept of patterns which are nite hyperbolic graphs embedded into closed Riemann surfaces and which determine the size and shape of the unit cell of hyperbolic lattices For this pur pose we rst recall the classication of Riemann surfaces M via their number of holes We then describe how to determine which patterns can be drawn onto which sur faces and identify those patterns that cover the surface with a single face because they are particularly impor tant for hyperbolic crystallography Let M be a twodimensional connected Riemannian manifold We call M a Riemann surface in the fol lowing The uniformization theorem states that ev ery such surface M is conformally equivalent to a sur face with constant curvature being either 1 0 or 1 This means that when expressed in socalled isother mal coordinates the Riemannian metric takes the form ds2 xdx2 dy2 where x is such that the cur vature is constant If M is simply connected ie has no holes it is thus equivalent to either the sphere S2 the complex plane C or the Poincare disk D If M has holes which can only happen for curvature 0 and 1 then it is either equivalent to a torus with genus g 1 curva ture 0 or it is a hyperbolic surface curvature 1 of the form D where is a socalled Fuchsian group intro duced in Sec III C If the hyperbolic surface is compact it is fully characterized by its number of holes which coincides with its genus g 2 Every compact hyper6 a c b d FIG 5 Euclidean patterns on the torus of genus g 1 Fig ures a and b show 4 4 patterns c and d show 6 3 pat terns which are tessellations of the torus by regular squares and hexagons with the appropriate coordination number In stark contrast to hyperbolic surfaces a torus can be tessel lated with an arbitrary number of faces of an Euclidean pat tern Indeed if F E V is a solution of Eq 16 with 21 g 0 then every integer multiple thereof also has 0 and so also can tessellate the torus The pattern in a is made from 100 squares and 100 vertices the pattern in c from 72 hexagons and 144 vertices The patterns in b and d are special because they use only one face For the 4 4 pattern this requires one vertex for the 6 3 pattern it requires two vertices see Eq 21 bolic Riemann surface can therefore be thought of as a surface with at least two holes Following Ref 73 we dene a p q pattern on a closed Riemann surface M as a tessellation of M by reg ular pgons such that the coordination number of each vertex is q Closed here means that M has no boundary and therefore such a pattern is necessarily a qregular graph without boundary Examples are shown in Figs 5 and 6 The dual pattern is obtained by putting a vertex onto each face of the original pattern It is easy to see that the dual pattern is then a q p pattern on M Every p q pattern on a closed surface satises pF 2E qV 16 where F E V are the number of faces edges and ver tices of the pattern respectively It is easy to prove this relation Denote the adjacency matrix of the pattern by a then ij aij 2 ij 1 2E and ij aij q i 1 qV The equality to pF follows from going to the dual graph which has the same number of edges but faces exchanged for vertices The Euler characteristic of the pattern is given by F E V 17 If is even then the pattern can be embedded into an orientable surface M of genus g 73 with 21 g 18 FIG 6 Hyperbolic 8 8 pattern on a surface of genus g 2 This pattern corresponds to the minimal solution F0 E0 V0 1 4 1 of Eq 16 for p q 8 We use four dierent colors to visually distinguish the four edges We can construct this pattern by gluing together two tori from Fig 5b and merging the vertices from each torus into one vertex Importantly this pattern uses only one face We could not draw two faces of a 8 8pattern onto this surface Indeed since the minimal solution has 21g 2 the doubled solution 2F0 2E0 2V0 can only be embedded into a surface with 4 or genus g 3 Similar restrictions on the num ber of faces for a given surface of genus g 2 apply to all hyperbolic p q patterns On the other hand if is odd then the pattern can be embedded into a nonorientable surface M but this case will not be of relevance to us Given a solution F E V of Eq 16 we can generate more solutions by multiplying the rst solution by an ar bitrary integer Crucially for hyperbolic p q patterns the number of faces F and the genus g 2 of the sur face are not independent This can be understood purely algebraically or possibly more intuitively geometrically Algebraically multiplying a solution F E V of Eq 16 by an integer n yields a pattern with nF nE nV on a surface with characteristic n For g 2 this cor responds to a surface of higher genus than the original one Increasing the number of faces is thus equivalent to increasing the genus for hyperbolic patterns For Eu clidean patterns with g 1 and 0 on the other hand the number of faces is not restricted We show some instructive examples in Figs 5 and 6 Geometrically it is clear that the combined area of the faces of the pattern needs to match the area of the closed Riemann surface In the Euclidean case the size of squares or regular hexagons is arbitrary and a matching is possible for any number of faces For regular hyperbolic polygons in a p q pattern on the other hand the area of a single polygon is xed to Ap q p 2 p 2 q The area of the hyperbolic surface is 4g 1 via the GauBonnet theorem and so we arrive at the necessary condition FAp q 4g 1 19 which relates F and g This condition is satised if F E V solves Eq 16 For every p q there exists a minimal solution7

given p q the list gives the smallest genus g0 such that a p qpattern with F0 faces E0 edges and V0 vertices can be drawn onto an orientable surface of genus g0 Every integer multiple of F0 E0 V0 also yields a p q pattern but on a surface with higher genus An exception is the Euclidean case with 0 0 where the number of squares or hexagons that can be used to cover a torus is arbitrary We highlight in boldface solutions that constitute a pattern with a single face since these correspond to potential regular Bravais lattices F0 E0 V0 with smallest number of faces F0 and there fore smallest E0 and V0 To nd the minimal solution start with F0 1 and check whether pF0 is divisible by 2 and q and if not increase F0 by one unit We restrict admissible minimal solutions to even values of thus orientable surfaces multiplying by two if the algorithm described above yields an odd We present a selection of minimal solutions in Table I Among the minimal solutions of patterns the ones with F0 1 stand out If a p q pattern can be em bedded into a closed surface with only one face then this implies that we can consistently dene periodic boundary conditions on the associated regular pgon with interior angles 2q This connection has been explained in detail in Ref 74 Every solution with F0 1 satises F0 E0 V0 1 p2 pq 20 hence p must be even and must satisfy p q It is easy to see that four innite families of such patterns are 4g 4g F0 E0 V0 1 2g 1 22g 1 2g 1 F0 E0 V0 1 2g 1 2 42g 1 4 F0 E0 V0 1 22g 1 2g 1 62g 1 3 F0 E0 V0 1 32g 1 22g 1 21 where g 1 is the genus of the embedding surface These families obviously generalize the square and hexagonal lattices 4 4 and 6 3 to higher genus One can show that every solution with F0 1 and even is contained in one of the two families i Either q is a multiple of 4 then the associated pattern is of type 4m2n 1 4m 22 or ii q is odd so that the pattern is of type 22m 12n 1 2m 1 23 p q F0 E0 V0 0 g0 8 8 1 4 1 2 2 10 5 1 5 2 2 2 12 4 1 6 3 2 2 18

such patterns are solutions to Eq 16 with F0 1 The number of these solutions varies with g For instance there are four admissible patterns for g 4 6 but six solutions for g 5 In both cases m 1 and n 0 are integers and the genus is g 2n 1m n For m n g 0 and m n 1 g 1 we recover the four patterns from Eq 21 For a given g more than the four patterns in Eq 21 may exist We summarize the solutions for g 2 3 in Table II The fact that a 4g 4g pattern can be drawn onto a surface of genus g 1 using one face and one vertex gives an elegant way to construct highergenus surfaces by taking a single hyperbolic 4ggon in the Poincare disk with interior angles 24g and identifying opposite edges to obtain a closed manifold For g 1 identifying opposite sides of a square yields a torus while for g 2 identifying opposite sides of an octagon yields a genus 2 surface and so on The octagon case is visualized in Fig 7 If we wish to equip a hyperbolic pgon with8 1 2 3 4 5 6 FIG 7 Identifying opposite sides of an octagon yields a closed genus2 Riemann surface We show one possible set of steps to arrive at this wellknown result We only consider the topol ogy and therefore are free to deform the surface in any way 1 Opposite edges of the octagon which are to be identied are represented by the same color 2 Gluing together the blue edges we obtain a prism with triangular base 3 Identifying the red edges we obtain a torus with a rectangular window The sides of the window are the yet unidentied green and pink edges 4 Gluing together the green edges we arrive at a torus with a tunnel on its surface The entrance and exit of the tunnel are the pink edges 5 Topologically this is equiv alent to a torus with two chimneys 6 Eventually identifying the pink rims of both chimneys we obtain a surface with two handles interior angles 2q with periodic boundary conditions by identifying certain edges then this is possible if and only if the corresponding p q pattern can be drawn onto a closed surface using only a single face This shows how the solutions with F0 1 are crucial for identifying a periodic pattern in general hyperbolic lattices We il luminate this setup with examples in the next sections Finally we note that we need not necessarily identify opposite edges of the pgon Other sidepairings are pos sible but not relevant for our considerations 66 67 III HYPERBOLIC CRYSTALLOGRAPHY In this section we generalize the basic notions of Eu clidean crystallography to the hyperbolic case For this purpose we rst discuss unit cells and Bravais lattices in symmorphic space groups We formulate the translation groups in the square and hexagonal lattice in a fashion that generalizes to higher genus We then present the discrete symmetry and translation groups for hyperbolic lattices with regular Bravais lattices of the types 4g 4g and 22g 1 2g 1 We close this section with a re FIG 8 Euclidean Bravais lattices have two independent gen erators of translations This implies that momentum space in Euclidean Bloch wave theory is twodimensional Left In the 4 4 lattice translations are generated by the two prim itive translations 1 and 2 from Eq 28 Both operations commute which can be written as 11 2 1 1 2 1 The latter relation represents the fact that going right around a vertex four times brings one back to where one started Right In the 6 3 lattice three generators 1 2 3 can be dened naively see Eq 31 However only two of them are independent since 11 2 3 1 The remaining two satisfy 11 2 1 1 2 1 as in the square lattice case mark on the order of the point group in hyperbolic lat tices A Unit cell and Bravais lattice We rst recall the crystallographic notions of unit cell and Bravais lattice For a detailed introduction we refer to Ref 71 Given a discrete set of points zi that constitutes the lattice there exists a maximal group G acting on the coordinates that leaves the lattice invari ant called the space group We assume in the following that this space group is symmorphic 71 The lattice can then be split into unit cells and a Bravais lattice in the following manner Each site zi can be uniquely written as zi za 24 where za is an element from a reference unit cell D z1 zN which consists of a nite number of sites and where is an element from a discrete transla tion group G which is the symmetry group of the Bravais lattice Roughly speaking a translation is a sym metry transformation without xed point The split in Eq 24 allows us to uniquely write the index of zi as i a where and a specify the location of zi in the Bravais lattice and unit cell respectively For such a split to exist needs to be a normal subgroup of G which follows from the assumption that G is symmorphic The corresponding quotient group G G is the point group of the lattice As an example of how to construct a lattice with a given unit cell and Bravais lattice consider the Eu clidean 4 4 lattice in Fig 8 We decorate a sin gle fundamental square with a nite number of sites9 D z1 zN each site placed within the same square Since the fundamental square can cover a torus we could endow it with periodic boundary conditions by identifying opposite sides and the unit cell would now be embedded on a torus On the other hand instead of covering a torus with a single face we may also use the fundamental square to tessellate the Euclidean plane In this alternative point of view when leaving one square by applying one of the primitive translation vectors of the square lattice say 1 we do not enter the same square but rather enter the neighboring square We iterate this translation procedure using all sides of the fundamental domain In this way we tessellate the Euclidean plane with repetitions of D and the resulting periodic set of sites zi is a Euclidean lattice with unit cell D and Bra vais lattice 4 4 Clearly if we started with a fundamental hexagon of the 6 3 lattice in the previous example we would have obtained a lattice in the Euclidean plane with Bravais lattice 6 3 see Fig 8 It is then very natural to ask whether starting from a fundamental pBgon we obtain a lattice whose Bravais lattice is pB qB for some qB This expectation turns out to be true but not every pair of integers pB qB qualies for a potential Bravais lattice In fact the construction described in the previous para graph relies on assigning consistent periodic boundary conditions to the fundamental polygon This is possible if and only if pB qB allows for a solution of Eq 16 with F0 1 ie the fundamental domain can cover a closed surface with a single face Obviously this con dition is satised for the Euclidean examples 4 4 and 6 3 In the hyperbolic case we see that only certain pB qB lattices such as the innite families 4g 4g or 22g 1 2g 1 constitute valid Bravais lattices Re markably there are innitely many Bravais lattices in the hyperbolic plane We demonstrate the construction of the 8 3 lattice by decorating the fundamental octagon of the 8 8 Bravais lattice in App A The idea is outlined in Fig 9 A Bravais lattice will be called regular if its fundamen tal domain is a regular polygon and so is a pB qB lat tice for some pB and qB This is a severe constraint For instance the internal angles of the fundamental polygon may not all be equal while still yielding a valid Bravais lattice We will see however that many examples that are important for experiments and applications fall into the class of regular Bravais lattices B Euclidean case In the next few paragraphs we return to the Euclidean example from the previous section and explicitly con struct the translations that facilitate the tessellation of the Euclidean plane It is wellknown that Euclidean lat tices in two dimensions are constructed from ve Bravais lattices and 17 possible space groups the latter called wallpaper groups in this context 71 The ve Bravais FIG 9 Left The 8 8 lattice shown in orange is a hy perbolic Bravais lattice with g0 2 The eight edges of its central octagon dene four generators of translations which we call 1 2 3 4 Each face of the 8 8 lattice is reached from the central polygon by applying a product of the four generators and their inverses The Euclidean analogue of this construction is shown in Fig 8 Right The unit cell of the 8 3 lattice has 16 sites red dots The corresponding Bra vais lattice is the 8 8 lattice with the fundamental octagon shown in orange By applying on the original 16site unit cell each of the generators 1 2 3 4 of the 8 8 lattice and their inverses once we generate 8 16 128 new sites blue dots Iterating this procedure we eventually generate the whole 8 3 lattice see Fig 13 lattices can be characterized by their two primitve trans lation vectors a1 and a2 Let denote the angle be tween a1 and a2 Among the ve Bravais lattices only the square lattice and hexagonal lattice are regular ie a1 a2 with 90 and 120 respectively The remaining three oblique rectangular centered rectangu lar have a1 a2 and so are not regular As elucidated before the appearance of the 4 4 and 6 3 lattices as regular Bravais lattices in the Euclidean plane is deeply rooted in the fact that these lattices can cover a genus one torus with a single face Let us explicitly construct the translation group for the 4 4 Bravais lattice For a 2 2 matrix M we dene its action on z C denoted Mz through the generalization of Eq 6 by a b c d z az b cz d 25 assuming of course that M is such that the denominator is nonzero The square lattice shall be aligned as in Fig 8 We choose the side length or lattice constant to be a0 1 Every translation of the fundamental square is generated by the maps z 1z z 1 26 z 2z z i 27 corresponding to the two primitive translation vectors a1 1 and a2 i in complex notation and matrices 1 1 1 0 1 2 1 i 0 1 2810 Clearly the two operations commute 12 21 which can be written as 11 2 1 1 2 1 29 We call 1 and 2 the generators of the translation group Every translation connecting one point of the Bravais lat tice to another can be written as a suitable product of 1 2 and their inverses Consequently Eqs 28 spec ify a particular representation of the translation group of the 4 4 lattice The abstract presentation of the same group reads g1 1 2 11 2 1 1 2 1 Z2 30 Here we use the standard notation A B X Y 1 for a group generated by some A B and their inverses that satisfy the constraints X Y 1 An element of which is a certain ordered product of the generator and their inverses is called a word The group g1 of course is isomorphic to Z2 Next we construct the translation group for the Eu clidean 6 3 Bravais lattice The lattice shall be aligned as in Fig 8 Translations through the sides of the hexagon are generated by z z z e with lat tice constant a0 1 primitive vectors e1 1 e2 ei3 e3 e2i3 and translation generators 1 1 e1 0 1 2 1 e2 0 1 3 1 e3 0 1 31 Note that we have e1 e2 e3 0 and so 11 2 3 1 e1 e2 e3 0 1 1 32 Hence the number of independent generators is two not three just as for the 4 4 lattice The translation group of the 6 3 lattice is thus given by 63 1 2 3 11 2 3 11 2 1 1 2 1 1 2 11 2 1 1 2 1 g1 33 Since 3 can be expressed in terms of 1 and 2 every word in 123 is also a word in 12 The two Euclidean translation groups are therefore isomorphic and fully characterized by the genus g 1 The two Euclidean lattices discussed here are the spe cial case of g 1 for the genusg lattices 4g 4g and 22g 1 2g 1 analyzed in the following Although similarities between the Euclidean and hyperbolic cases remain the most striking dierence for g 2 is the fact that the generators no longer commute The proper framework to discuss these noncommuting translations is the language of Fuchsian groups C Fuchsian groups A discrete subgroup of P PSU1 1 is called a Fuch sian group It is very natural to expect symmetry groups of hyperbolic lattices to be Fuchsian groups 1 66 67 70 Indeed under a symmetry transformation of the lattice two neighboring sites zi and zj separated by a hyper bolic distance dzi zj d0 that is determined by p and q should be mapped to two neighboring points separated by the same hyperbolic distance Since P is precisely the group of transformations that preserve the hyper bolic distance the symmetry group must be made from elements of P On the other hand clearly only a discrete set of transformations will leave the lattice invariant The full space group of the hyperbolic p q lattice is given by the triangle group p q 2 x y z x2 y2 z2 xyp yzq zx2 1 34 The geometric meaning of the generators x y z is not important for this work Suce to say that this group contains a reection along a symmetry axis and thus orientationreversing elements hence is not a subgroup of P but more generally referred to as nonEuclidean crystallographic group 67 70 On the other hand we can consider the quotient p q 2 p q 2Z2 of transformations modulo this reection which con sists of orientationpreserving automorphisms and thus is a Fuchsian group Equivalently the full space group is given by the semidirect product p q 2 p q 2 Z2 Due to this simple nature of the fac tor Z2 we will often ignore the reection symmetry We refer to p q 2 P as proper triangle group It has the presentation p q 2 A B Ap Bq AB2 1P 35 with A xy B yz A particular representation of the generators A and B through Pmatrices is given by A ei2 0 0 ei2 36 B 1 1 r2 0 ei2 r2 0ei2 r01 eiei 2 r01 eiei 2 ei2 r2 0ei2 37 with r0 from Eq 9 and 2 p 2 q 38 Geometrically A is a rotation by through the center of a face here chosen to be the origin whereas B is a rotation by through a vertex here chosen to be z1 r0ei2 The elements of a Fuchsian group are classied as el liptic parabolic or hyperbolic if their trace is less than equal to or greater than 2 A typical elliptic element is given by the rotation matrix R ei2 0 0 ei2 3911 with 0 Indeed under R we have z eiz and is the angle of rotation Elliptic elements have one xed point which here is the center of the rotation A typical hyperbolic element is given by the matrix T cosh2 sinh2 sinh2 cosh2 40 with 0 The signicance of the parameter can be understood from applying T to the origin z 0 We have 0 T0 tanh2 41 Now note that Eq 4 implies dz 0 2artanhz Consequently under T the origin is mapped to the coordinate on the real axis that is at hyperbolic distance from the origin This nding together with the form of T that closely resembles a Lorentz transformation motivates us to call T a boost transformation and the boost parameter or rapidity Importantly like every hyperbolic element of a Fuchsian group boosts do not have xed points In this sense they generalize Euclidean translations to the hyperbolic case The generators A and B can be expressed in terms of rotations and boosts via A R 42 B R2T0RT0R2 43 with 0 2 artanhr0 We are now in a position to characterize the translation groups associated to Bravais lattices in hyperbolic space We dene a Fuchsian translation group as a torsion free Fuchsian group Torsion free means that no element from satises n 1 for some suitable integer n In our case this is ensured by being strictly hyperbolic which means that all elements are hyperbolic Obviously p q 2 is not a Fuchsian translation group because the generators A and B satisfy Ap 1 and Bq 1 Let us pause here for a word on notation The intrinsic properties of a p q lattice are fully specied by the in tegers p and q This includes for instance the value of r0 in Eq 9 the hyperbolic distance d0 dzi zj between any two neighboring points zi and zj or the parameters of the regular geodesic pgon C 1 p with internal angles 2q in Eq 13 In what follows we will discuss p q lattices and their associated pB qB Bravais lattices To distinguish these two we denote pa rameters of the Bravais lattice by a subscript B which indicates that we need to replace p q pB qB in the corresponding formula It is rather easy to construct a representation of the Fuchsian translation group for the regular pB qB Bravais lattice We restrict ourselves to the 4g 4g and 22g 1 2g 1 Bravais lattices in the follow ing From Eq 16 it follows that solutions with F0 1 necessarily have even pB The fundamental domain is a regular pBgon with internal angles B and with edges parametrized by CB from Eq 13 An example of the fundamental polygon of the 8 8 Bravais lattice is shown in Fig 4 We center the fundamental polygon at the origin and align it such that C1B intersects the posi tive real axis orthogonally Opposite sides of the polygon are identied The rst generator of 1 is a boost that translates one fundamental polygon through side C1B to the neighboring polygon on the right Consequently the transformation 1 T1 44 shifts the center of the original polygon to the center of the neighboring polygon which again lies on the real axis Hence the boost parameter is given by 1 2AB with AB from Eq 10 This yields the explicit form 1 1 1 2 1 1 45 with cos B cos B1 cos B and B 2pB B 2qB The full set of generators re sults from conjugating this boost with a rotation by B and reads R 1B1R 1B 46 with 1 pB2 Since pB is even the generators are welldened The Fuchsian translation group of the regular Bravais lattice is given by pBqB 1 pB2 XpBqB 1P 47 with XpBqB a constraint For practical purposes this constraint is often unimportant since the representation of the generators in terms of the matrices in Eq 46 automatically satises the constraint We derive this con straint in Appendix B The important outcomes of this analysis are i that only 2g of the generators are inde pendent and ii that XpBqB only depends on g and is given by Xg 11 2 2g11 2g 1 1 2 1 2g12g 48 Intuitively this condition means that going right around a vertex 4g times brings one back to where one started Hence the Fuchsian translation group g 1 2g Xg 1P 49 is fully determined by the genus g g0 of the Bravais lattice D Point groups Having identied the Fuchsian translation group the point group is given by G p q 2 with p q 2 from Eq 34 being the full space group of the hyper bolic lattice Since p q 2 has a trivial Z2 factor the12 same is true for G and we could dene the point group of orientationpreserving transformations G GZ2 Since this is not common in crystallography however we work with G in the following We denote the or der number of elements of G by G The number G p q 2 is also called the index of in p q 2 In mathematical terms g is the surface group of a closed Riemann surface M with genus g ie it is iso morphic to the rst homotopy group of the surface g 1M The order of the point group then follows from the following proposition 83 of Ref 73 Let P be a p qpattern on a closed surface M and let p q 2 be an associated subgroup such that 1M Then the index of in p q 2 is G 2pF where F is the number of faces of P This allows us to determine the size of the point group which since the number of nite groups of certain size is limited often determines the point group G and closed surface M The factor of 2 corresponds to the Z2factor in G G Z2 Examples of point groups that arise for hyperbolic lattices are given in the next section IV REGULAR HYPERBOLIC BRAVAIS LATTICES In this section we discuss hyperbolic p q lattices with regular pB qB Bravais lattices Such a discus sion involves for a given suitable p and q specifying the location of sites in the unit cell and the corresponding integers pB and qB The size of the unit cell is denoted by N We limit the presentation to those cases where the Bra vais lattice is either of the form 4g 4g or 22g1 2g 1 and we call g the genus of the Bravais lattice for short More accurately however it is the genus of the closed Riemann surface that can embed the unit cell with pe riodic boundary conditions Within this restricted set several remarkable innite families arise that are relevant for experiments with hyperbolic lattices and applications such as hyperbolic band theory Furthermore for g 2 and g 3 we show that besides the members of these innite families a few exceptional cases exist a behavior that potentially extends to higher genera The examples collected in this section have been found through a systematic search but via a casebycase study Hence although we believe that the list within the re strictions specied is rather complete we cannot exclude that we missed outliers Given the novelty of having a list of experimentally relevant examples we believe that such a potential incompleteness can be tolerated Our search method is described in Appendix E For future work it will be exciting to specify criteria which are both neces sary and sucient for a p q lattice to have a regular Bravais lattice of the above kind p q pB qB N 4g 4g 4g 4g 1 2g 1 22g 1 22g 1 2g 1 1 22g 1 2g 1 22g 1 2g 1 2 4g 4 4g 4g 2g 22g 1 3 22g 1 2g 1 22g 1 TABLE III We identify ve innite families of p q lattices whose Bravais lattices are regular 4g 4g or 22g1 2g1 lattices The number of corresponding sites in the unit cell is denoted by N The construction of these families namely the placement of the unit cell inside the fundamental domain of the Bravais lattice is shown in Figs 10 and 11 A Innite families We rst discuss ve innite families of p q lattices and their according regular Bravais lattices They are constructed from systematically placing unit cell sites in the fundamental polygons of either the 4g 4g or the 22g 1 2g 1 Bravais lattices Here systematically means that the placing naturally extends to arbitrarily large genus g Furthermore the wellknown Euclidean cases are recovered in the limit g 1 The ve families are listed in Table III We have explicitly veried the entries in this table for all g 8 which is much beyond what is experimentally relevant It is very plausible that their construction applies to g 8 Therefore we will continue to call these families innite The rst family is obtained by placing a single unit cell site N 1 into the center of each face of the 4g 4g Bravais lattice see Fig 10 Applying the Fuchsian trans lation group to this single site we generate the dual lat tice of the Bravais lattice which is again the 4g 4g lattice In the Euclidean case this generates the 4 4 lattice from the 4 4 regular Bravais lattice The size of the point group due to F0 1 for p q 4g 4g is G 2p The corresponding point group is the dihedral group Dp consisting of rotations by 2p and reections along a symmetry axis The second family is obtained in a similar fashion by placing a single unit cell site N 1 into the cen ter of each face of the 22g 1 2g 1 Bravais lat tice The p q lattice obtained in this manner is the 2g 1 22g 1 lattice see Fig 10 For g 1 this construction generates the triangular 3 6 lattice from the 6 3 lattice Since p q 2g 1 22g 1 im plies F0 2 the size of the point group is G 4p and the point group is the dihedral group D2p The third family is generated by placing two unit cell sites N 2 on two neighboring vertices of the funda mental polygon of the 22g 1 2g 1 Bravais lat tice Applying the Fuchsian translation group we ar rive at the 22g 1 2g 1 lattice see Fig 10 In the Euclidean example we generate the hexagonal 6 313 FIG 10 The 4g 4g and 22g 1 2g 1 Bravais lattices give rise to the rst three innite families in Table III in a simple fashion By placing a single site into the center of the fundamental polygon we generate the dual 4g 4g left column and 2g 1 22g 1 lattices middle column with a unit cell of size N 1 Furthermore the 22g 1 2g 1 lattice is generated from the 22g 1 2g 1 Bravais lattice by placing the two unit cell sites onto vertices of the fundamental polygon right column All three constructions directly generalize the Euclidean case g 1 to higher genus lattice from the 6 3 lattice The point group of the p q 22g 1 2g 1 lattice is again the dihedral group Dp It is wellknown that the triangular lattice is the sublattice of the hexagonal lattice How this result generalizes to the hyperbolic case is discussed in App C The fourth family generalizes the Euclidean case in a way less obvious than the previous examples Given the fundamental 4ggon of the 4g 4g Bravais lattice we place N 2g unit cell sites on the centers of its rst 2g edges see Fig 11 This generates the 4g 4 lat tice with coordination number 4 For g 1 we obtain the 4 4 lattice from the 4 4 Bravais lattice mutu ally rotated by an angle of 4 with a nonminimal unit cell Indeed in the Euclidean case we could identify the smaller squares as the fundamental domain and so ob tain a unit cell with one site This is because the 4 4 lattice is itself a Bravais lattice In the hyperbolic case with g 1 the 4g 4 lattice is a Bravais lattice only if g is odd so that we can write g 2g 1 In this case we can identify a smaller fundamental domain for a Bravais lattice of genus g as is explained in the caption of Fig 11 whereas for even g this is not possible The order of the point group is G 2pF0 with F0 1 F0 2 for g odd even In the rst case the point group is the dihedral group Dp The fth family is obtained from the 22g1 2g1 Bravais lattice By placing N 22g 1 unit cell sites at radius r0 facing the edges of the fundamental polygon of the Bravais lattice we obtain the 22g 1 3 lattice FIG 11 Top row The innite family of 4g 4 lattices has a unit cell of 2g sites red dots which are placed in the edge centers of the fundamental polygon of their 4g 4g Bravais lattice If g is odd we can write g 2g 1 In this case the lattices are themselves 42g 1 4 Bravais lattices of genus g and a smaller unit cell can be identied For even g on the other hand such a reduction is not possible Bottom row The innite family of 22g 1 3 lattices has a unit cell of 22g 1 sites red dots that are facing the edges of the fundamental polygon of their 22g 1 2g 1 Bravais lattice If 2g 1 is a multiple of 3 we can write 2g 1 32g 1 and the lattices are 62g 1 3 Bravais lattices with a reduced unit cell and smaller fundamental domain For other values of g again such a reduction is not possible with coordination number 3 see Fig 11 The 10 3 lattice discussed in Fig 2 falls into this family The Eu clidean case corresponds to placing a smaller hexagonal lattice into a larger hexagonal Bravais lattice and again in this case a smaller unit cell can be identied because the 6 3 lattice is itself a Bravais lattice In the hyper bolic case as is explained in the caption of Fig 11 this is only possible if 2g 1 is a multiple of 3 The order of the point group is G 2pF0 with F0 1 F0 3 for g a multiple of three else For F0 1 the point group is the dihedral group Dp B Exceptional cases for g 2 and g 3 The list of all p q lattices for g 2 and g 3 with a regular Bravais lattice of type 4g 4g or 22g1 2g 1 is presented in Table IV The ve innite families from Table III yield ten of the entries but four entries are ex ceptional because they do not fall into the innite fam ilies In the future it will be important to study the exceptional cases for g 3 and see if they generalize14 p q pB qB V0 g0 N g 8 3 8 8 16 2 16 2 8 4 8 8 4 2 4 2 4 8 8 8 2 2 2 2 8 8 8 8 1 2 1 2 10 3 10 5 10 2 10 2 10 5 10 5 2 2 2

regular 4g 4g or 22g1 2g1 Bravais lattices of genus g 2 3 The number of unit cell sites is denoted by N The values of V0 and g0 correspond to the minimal solution of Eq 16 for given p q thus N g1 is an integer multiple of V0 g01 The unit cells and fundamental domains of these lattices are shown in Figs 10 11 and 12 to innite families or whether they are genuinely excep tional For Bravais lattices of genus g 2 the 8 3 and 4 8 lattices are exceptional see Fig 12 The 8 3 lattice as also discussed in Fig 9 has a 16site unit cell inside the fundamental octagon of the 8 8 Bravais lattice The number of unit cell sites matches V0 16 obtained from Eq 16 for p q 8 3 The order of the point group follows from F0 6 to be G 2 48 The ensuing pattern tessellates the socalled Bolza surface and the point group coincides with the full automorphism group of the latter which is known explicitly The 4 8 lattice has a unit cell of two sites that are placed on specic edges of the fundamental octagon of the 8 8 Bravais lattice Again the number of unit cell sites matches the prediction V0 2 from Eq 16 for p q 4 8 The size of the point group with F0 4 is G 2 16 The exceptional cases for g 3 Bravais lattices are the 7 3 and 4 12 lattices see Fig 12 The unit cell of the 7 3 features 56 sites The underlying Bravais lattice is the 14 7 lattice Note that the number of unit cell sites is twice the value of V0 28 obtained for p q 7 3 from Eq 16 and accordingly g 3 is larger than the minimal solution g0 2 The embedding Riemann surface is the socalled Klein quartic with full automorphism group of order G 2 168 which coin cides with the point group here due to F 24 For the 4 12 lattice the two unit cell sites are located on spe cic edges of the fundamental dodecagon of the 12 12 FIG 12 Among the 14 hyperbolic lattices listed in Table IV four do not fall into one of the ve innite families from Ta ble III These four exceptional cases are shown here together with their unit cell red dots and fundamental domain of the Bravais lattice orange polygon The 8 3 lattice and its unit cell have also been discussed in Fig 9 Bravais lattice Again the number of unit cell sites is twice the value of V0 1 obtained from Eq 16 from p q 4 12 The size of the point group follows from F 6 and is given by G 2 24 V ENERGY SPECTRA OF TIGHTBINDING HAMILTONIANS In this section we apply the crystallographic division of hyperbolic lattices into unit cells and Bravais lattices to address the problem of determining the energy spec tra of tightbinding Hamiltonians After discussing the general case we specify to Bloch waves and the compu tation of their energy bands The construction crucially relies on the possibility to uniquely write a lattice site zi as in Eq 24 as a product of a Fuchsian trans lation g and a site from a reference unit cell za z1 zN namely zi za 50 A canonical way to enumerate the innite but discrete set of Fuchsian translations is described in App A15 A Tightbinding Hamiltonians on innite lattices In this section we apply hyperbolic crystallography to dramatically simplify the spectral problem for the tight binding Hamiltonian H from Eq 1 on innite hyper bolic lattices The Schrodinger equation in coordinate representation is given by j Aijzj Ezi 51 for every site i with the sum on the left extending over all lattice sites of the innite lattice and Aij the adjacency matrix We introduce a function Az z such that Aij Azi zj 52 In the following we consider an innite hyperbolic p q lattice denoted with regular pB qB Bravais lattice being either the 4g 4g or 22g 1 2g 1 lattice We divide into patches of unit cells each surrounded by a fundamental polygon of the Bravais lattice and choose a reference unit cell D z1 zN In Eq 51 we write zi za as in Eq 50 Further more every neighboring site of zi must be of the form zb with some and b D Hence we arrive at bD Aza zbzb Eza 53 Crucially although written as an innite sum over ele ments of only q terms on the lefthand side of this equation are nonzero with Aza zb 1 The non vanishing contributions correspond to those that yield a neighboring site of zi It is straightforward to determine these q group elements for each za as they must satisfy dzb za dzb za d0 with nearestneighbor distance d0 Here we used the invari ance of the hyperbolic distance under isometries The Hamiltonian for the innite lattice is invariant under a simultaneous Fuchsian translation of all sites ie zi zi with This implies that the choice of the reference unit cell ie the value of cannot aect the solution of Eq 53 Formally dene the group action on the Hilbert space of wave functions as Tz 1z Then an overall factor T1 can be extracted from Eq 53 and we arrive at bD Aza zbzb Eza 54 which is equivalent to setting 1P Equation 54 is one of the central results of this work and the key ap plication of hyperbolic crystallography to tightbinding Hamiltonians We accomplished to reduce the eigenvalue problem in Eq 51 which needs to be solved for the in nite number of graph sites zi to a set of N coupled equations for the unit cell sites za Each of these equa tions features only a nite number of nonvanishing terms This reduction needs to be compared to the signicance of Euclidean crystallography in studying Euclidean lat tice models where the band structure is typically ob tained from a few lines of calculation after the unit cell has been identied As with every symmetry in quantum mechanics the translation invariance of the Hamiltonian implies that its eigenfunctions belong to irreducible representations irrep of Assume that these irreps are labeled by k and that k is a wave function in the corresponding eigenspace of dimension dk over C with energy Ek If kmz m 1 dk is a basis of the eigenspace then we write kz dk m1 cmzkmz 55 and the coecients cm transform linearly under as cm m Dmmcm with a matrix D satis fying D12 D1D2 Writing ca m cmza we arrive at bD dk m1 Aza zbDmmcb m Eca m 56 The corresponding number of linear coupled equations for the coecients ca m that determine the energy Ek is N dk Together equations 54 and 56 consti tute the rst step towards computing the eigenvalues and band structure of the tightbinding Hamiltonian H B Bloch wave theory In this section we sketch the implications of Eq 56 for onedimensional representations dk 1 We nd that in this case k k k1 k2gT The corre sponding eigenfunctions kz are Bloch waves and lead to an intriguing band structure A detailed study of the related Bloch wave theory for hyperbolic lattices will be presented elsewhere For Euclidean lattices the translation group g1 Z2 is Abelian and so all irreducible representations are onedimensional Blochs theorem We label Euclidean translations by n Z2 and have Eucl k nx eiknEucl k x 57 with the crystal momentum k labeling the irreducible representations For hyperbolic lattices g is non Abelian and so not all irreducible representations are one dimensional On the other hand it is natural to expect that some eigenfunctions z of H transform according to a onedimensional representation ie satisfy kz eikkz 5816 with generalized crystal momentum k k1 kpB2 and the index 1 pB2 counting the number of momentum components We refer to functions kz sat isfying Eq 58 as Bloch waves They are also called au tomorphic forms with respect to the group g P Note that the condition Xg 1 from Eq 48 is automatically satised for Bloch waves Importantly the number of in dependent momentum components of k is 2g Hence for hyperbolic Bloch waves g 1 the dimension of coor dinate and momentum space dier

the introduction VI SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK In this work we have developed a crystallography for innite hyperbolic p q lattices By utilizing the notion of patterns on Riemann surfaces we identied regular pB qB lattices that constitute Bravais lattices We then explicitly constructed examples of p q lattices whose Bravais lattices are of this type and discussed the asso ciated unit cells Among the examples are ve innite families and a handful of exceptional cases for genus two and three many of which we expect to be relevant for advancing our understanding of hyperbolic lattices in fu ture studies To the best of our knowledge no such list of hyperbolic lattices and their Bravais lattices existed before The explicit formulas for Fuchsian translation groups constructed in this work bridge the gap between abstract mathematics and concrete calculations and will be crucial in practical applications The present work therefore lays the foundation for applying powerful con cepts of solid state physics such as crystal momentum or Bloch waves to hyperbolic lattices A number of pressing questions are raised by the re sults presented here Here as an outlook we point out two of them 1 Classication of p q lattices In the present work we only searched for hyperbolic lattices with reg ular Bravais lattices We do not know whether every p q lattice has a regular Bravais lattice Given the small set of lattices we identied from our systematic search we expect that large classes of p q lattices have irregular Bravais lattices For instance such a Bravais lattice can have a fundamental domain that is a polygon whose internal angles are not all equal This expecta tion is also supported by the Euclidean case where only two out of ve Bravais lattices are regular Furthermore even within the set of regular Bravais lattices we only discussed those of type 4g 4g or 22g 1 2g 1 because their Fuchsian translation group g is easily con structed On the other hand more regular Bravais lat tices such as 42g 1 3 and 62g 1 3 follow from F0 1 We found that some p q lattices seem to fea ture these Bravais lattices but leave a conclusive study for future investigation 2 Representation theory Equation 56 constitutes the rst step towards solving the spectral problem for the tightbinding Hamiltonian on an innite hyperbolic17 lattice ie determining the singleparticle energy band structure We have outlined how onedimensional rep resentations of the group g lead to Bloch wave theory for hyperbolic lattices It will be extremely exciting to study higherdimensional representations and how their appearance is linked to the noncommutativity of spatial isometries First important results in this direction have been obtained in Ref 72 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors thank C Baldwin P Bienias R

eciently and system atically create large hyperbolic lattices by applying the Fuchsian translation group to a single unit cell One way of computing the coordinates of a large regu lar hyperbolic tessellation of the Poincare disk is to start with a single pgon and apply products of the genera tors A and B of the proper triangle group p q 2 in Eq 35 This method is conceptually simple and can be applied for any p q lattice However since el ements from p q 2 have xed points this method suers the drawback that lattice sites are duplicated sev eral times with every iteration Therefore at the end of the procedure the duplicated sites need to be identied and eliminated which can be numerically challenging as the sites accumulate close to the Poincare disk boundary for large lattices In addition creating the lattice this way does not immediately yield a systematic labeling of sites An alternative and ecient way of computing the co ordinates of large hyperbolic lattices is implied by the results presented here For this we rst need to digress to discuss the nature of elements of the Fuchsian trans lation group g Every element of g is a product of the generators 1 pB2 and their inverses Since it would be cumbersome to always mention the in verses separately we utilize that 1 pB2 and will hereafter refer to with 1 pB as the gen erators Every g is then a word of specic length n in the generators ie a product of n generators with a welldened order For a word of length n we write 1 n A1 with i 1 pB The ntuple or vector 1 n species the element Thus the discrete but innite set of nontrivial Fuchsian translations can be labeled by integer vectors of arbitrary length n 1 and the discrete index i in Eq 50 corresponds to a discrete index a To determine the number of words of length n within a group that is generated by a nite number of generators is called the word problem for the group The number of naive products of length n is pn B in our case but the number of words of length n is smaller First whenever the combination 1 1 appears the word size is re duced Second constraints like Xg 1 in g lead to further reductions As an example for the 8 8 Bra vais lattice with eight generators we have 11 2 31 4 1 4 31 2 1 and other resulting relations and the num ber of words of length n 1 2 3 is 8 56 392 whereas the number of naive products is 8n 8 64 512 In practice solving the word problem is not dicult when using the particular representation of the generators from Eq 46 Let us now describe our algorithm to create hyper bolic lattices Assume the p q lattice has a unit cell of size N with coordinates z1 zN D and a regular pB qB Bravais lattice We dene the nth gen eration lattice as the set of all points that are generated by applying words of length up to n in the generators of pBqB to the unit cell The 0th generation is just the unit cell the 1st generation contains the unit cell and and all points obtained from applying each generators once hence pB 1N total sites and so on In Fig 13 we show as an example how the 8 3 lattice with 16site unit cell and 8 8 Bravais lattice is generated in this manner The lowest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix is found to be larger than 3 with coordination18 2817 2770 2666 2414 FIG 13 We show how to eciently create large samples of the 8 3 lattice without repetitions of sites by applying the Fuchsian translation group 2 to the 16site unit cell The nth generation consists of all points that are obtained by applying words in the generators of 2 of length up to n 0 The corresponding number of sites in the nth generation is 16 n 0 144 n 1 1040 n 2 and 7312 n 3 The plots at the bottom show the corresponding eigenvalues j of the adjacency matrix The spectrum of the latter is contained in the interval 3 3 The lowest eigenvalue highlighted red in each plot has a sizable gap from 3 a characteristic feature of hyperbolic lattices number q 3 in the example for all n This gap is a characteristic feature of hyperbolic lattices and surfaces and is expected to converge to a nonzero value for large n 18 33 75 76 Let us comment on a ne point regarding the num ber of independent generators Clearly the group g is independent of pB and always has 4g independent gen erators Nevertheless when generating a p q lattice whose Bravais lattice is the 22g 1 2g 1 lattice one can choose to either work with the 4g independent generators or to use all 4g 2 generators What changes is the number of words of length n that can be composed from these generators and hence the number of sites in the nth generation lattice but the procedure is not af icted otherwise Using all 4g 2 generators has the advantage of obtaining a radially symmetric lattices in each generation which may be favorable in applications Appendix B Fuchsian translation groups The constraint XpBqB 1 in Eq 47 generalizes the Euclidean cases from Eqs 29 and 32 in an interest ing manner to higher genera We rst consider 4g 4g Bravais lattices with g 2 In this case the generator 1 has the simple form 4g4g 1 1 1 r2 0B 1 r2 0B 2r0B 2r0B 1 r2 0B B1 with r0B cosB The remaining follow from Eq 46 For g 2 we have X88 11 2 31 4 1 1 21 3 4 B2 which generalizes to X4g4g 11 2 2g11 2g 1 1 2 1 2g12g B3 for any g 2 For the 22g 1 2g 1 Bravais lattices with g 2 we have 1 1 1 r2 0B 1 r2 0B r0B 3 r2 0B r0B 3 r2 0B 1 r2 0B B4 Since the fundamental polygon has pB 4g 2 sides there are naively two more generators than for the 4g 4g Bravais lattice However both lattices tessel late surfaces of genus g and the number of independent generators should be equal The issue is resolved as in the case of the hexagonal 6 3 lattice by the fact that the translation 2g1 is not independent of the remaining 1 2g We have 11 2 1 2g 2g1 1g11 B5 The remaining 2g independent generators satisfy the same constraint as for the 4g 4g lattice ie we have X22g12g1 X4g4g B619 and therefore 22g12g1 4g4g B7 Appendix C Sublattice structure An interesting analogy to the Euclidean case can be observed in the third family in Table III Placing a single site N 1 on a vertex of the fundamental polygon of the 22g 1 2g 1 lattice we generate the 2g 1 22g 1 lattice instead This implies that the sites of the 2g1 22g1 lattice form the sublattice of the bipartite 22g1 2g1 lattice In the Euclidean case we obtain the wellknown fact that the 3 6 triangular lattice is the sublattice of the 6 3 honeycomb lattice However a subtle dierence arises in the hyperbolic case While the 3 6 lattice coincides with the nexttonearest neighbor graph of the 6 3 lattice which we dene here by connecting any two sites of the 6 3 lattice that are separated by two adjacent edges this is not true for g 1 because not all sites that are separated by two adjacent edges have the same hyperbolic distance We visualize the hyperbolic case for g 2 in Fig 14 Appendix D Distance spectrum In order to decide whether a given unit cell D z1 zN and regular pB qB Bravais lattice gen erate the innite p q lattice denoted pq we have to show that pBqBD pq D1 where pBqB is the Fuchsian translation group of the Bravais lattice In the remainder of this section we write pq pBqB D D2 and Eq D1 becomes Verifying Eq D1 may sound simple as one merely needs to check that every zi is contained in and vice versa However in practice no parametriza tion of the coordinates of the full hyperbolic lattice exists rather only powerful algorithms to construct a nite subset of it Furthermore it is impossible in practice to compute which is an innite set and would require applying the generators innitely often Rather one ap plies nitelength words in the generators to D Due to the exponential proliferation of words typical feasible word lengths range from 2 to 5 although this number depends on p and q So in practice we can only access a nite subset of either side of Eq D1 and neither of these subsets is strictly contained in the other To show that Eq D1 is true we need to conrm that 1 does not contain additional sites that are not in That is FIG 14 The bipartite 22g 1 2g 1 lattice can be di vided into two 2g 1 22g 1 lattices This wellknown fact from Euclidean lattices where the 3 6 triangular lat tice is the sublattice of the 6 3 honeycomb lattice gener alizes to hyperbolic lattices of higher genus Here we show the case of g 2 with the 10 5 lattice indicated by the gray geodesics and a selection of sites of the two sublattices marked red and blue One of the 5 10 sublattices is indi cated by blue geodesics 2 No sites in are doubled 3 No sites of are left out in This means that for any site zi we can make large enough so that zi That is We imply here that we can only compute large but nite samples By making these samples large enough and verifying 1 and 3 we obtain reliable evidence that Eq D1 is true Note that condition 2 is additional it shows that is a normal subgroup and that the unit cell D has been identied correctly ie the split in Eq 24 is unique The practical solution to verifying 1 and 2 con sists in identifying the distance spectrum as a unique n gerprint of any hyperbolic p q lattice Given the hy pothetical innite lattice we compute the list of val ues dzi zj where i j runs over all distinct lattice sites Crucially only a certain discrete set of numbers appears in this list which is fully specied by p and q We call this list the distance spectrum The rst entry is given by the nearestneighbor distance d0 dr0 r0e2ip D3 Some examples are shown in Table D Given a suciently large nite subset of either or we can compute their truncated distance spectra The nite subset needs to be reasonable ie contain at least one pair of nearest neighbors nextnearest neighbors etc We call the dis tance spectrum obtained from the nite sample of the reference spectrum and ignore its dierence from the full innite distance spectrum pq in the following20 7 3 8 3 9 3 d02 0283128 0363520 0409595 d12 0496385 0641645 0409596 d22 0606789

unique ngerprint of the hyperbolic lattice and can be used to decide whether a set of points zi could be a subset of the innite p qlattice The rst entry d0 is the hyperbolic distance between nearest neighbors To verify 1 we then compute the distance spectrum of It probes the local surrounding of every single site zi If there was any site zi that is not part of then the numbers dzi zj appearing in the distance spec trum of would not be contained in pq In practice we nd that this test is very sensitive to detecting lattice sites that should not be there with deviations showing up in the rst few entries of the distance spectra In con trast if two lattices seem to match ie the rst deviating entries in their truncated distance spectra of large samples show up at the hundredths or thousandths position giving strong evidence that 1 is true As a byproduct by computing the distance spectrum of we can show that no sites are doubled ie 2 is true by verifying that there is no entry dzi zj 0 in the distance spectrum The latter is computed for i j and so should not contain zeros The eciency of the method of comparing distance spectra stems from the fact that the agreement of the distance spectra of and is a necessary condition and therefore incompatible or wrong Bravais lattices yield a negative result and can be excluded even for small sample lattices Let us also point out that one can decide whether a given pB qB lattice can be the Bravais lattice of a given p q lattice without the precise knowledge of the unit cell D Since the Fuchsian translation group is a subgroup of the symmetry group of the p q lattice we have S D4 for every subset S By choosing a suciently large S such that D S we obtain equality in Eq D4 However S D violates 2 and so will create zero entries in the distance spectrum of S Let us now comment on condition 3 which is less straightforward to check Assuming that 1 and 2 hold the validity of 3 ensures that the unit cell has enough elements to generate the whole lattice Indeed if we removed a few sites za from D conditions 1 and 2 would still be satised but nonetheless This implies a method how to test 3 Assume our choice of D z1 zN satises 1 and 2 Condition 3 can only be violated if there is a lattice site zN1 D such that the union D zN1 still satises 2 Rea sonable choices for zN1 are limited in practice In all cases we identied the unit cell is either made from a connected graph ie every za in D is nearest neighbor to at least one zb in D or the sites from D are taken from the central pgon of the p q lattice Thus we only need to consider the nite set D zi dzi za d0 for some za D r0e2inpei n 1 p D5 The phase ei is for adjusting the overall rotation of the lattice within the unit cell and is easily found in each case If condition 2 fails for the enlarged unit cell D zN1 for every zN1 D then D is big enough to generate the whole lattice Since zN1 it is trivial that zN1 satises 1 We carried out this test of condition 3 for all lattices discussed here and found that no sites are missing in the listed unit cells An alternative way to test for condition 3 is to use a nite set of elements from to generate starting from D one pgon and all its neighboring pgons of the lattice This implies iteratively that all polygons of can be generated by applying elements from This method can be applied to almost all cases except for instance the 7 3 lattice with a very big unit cell Note that the condition X 1P ensures that after applying suciently many generators from we eventually obtain closed pgons Appendix E Systematic search for unit cells and Bravais lattices Assume we are given a p q lattice pq and want to determine its unit cell and Bravais lattice Assume further that the Bravais lattice is a regular pB qB lat tice A number of necessary conditions are implied by this which can be used for a systematic search of hyper bolic lattices and their regular Bravais lattices For this note that every generator of the Bravais lattice maps a center of a Bravais lattice face to a center of a Bra vais lattice face Put dierently maps a vertex of the dual qB pB lattice qBpB to a vertex in qBpB Since the Bravais lattice is rotation symmetric about the centers of its faces it is natural to expect that each center of a Bravais lattice face is also the center of some face of the p q lattice Consequently every site of the qB pB lattice is also a site of the dual q p lattice We thus formulate the dual lattice criterion that if pB qB is the Bravais lattice of p q under the above conditions then qBpB qp E1 Although just a necessary condition to match partners p q and pB qB it yields a very ecient and selective search algorithm21 A rst consequence of Eq E1 is that the distance spectrum of qB pB is contained in the distance spec trum of q p In particular this is true for the hy perbolic nearestneighbor distance in the qB pB lattice given by d0qBpB dr0B r0Be2iqB E2 Hence we arrive at the necessary condition d0qBpB qp E3 For a given pB qB it is numerically straightforward to identify all potential solutions p q from Eq E3 as for suciently large p and q the smallest entry d0qp on the righthand side becomes too large for the inclusion to be valid A second consequence of Eq E1 follows from the fact that the p q lattice is left invariant under rotations by 2p around the centers of its faces If such a rotation point is also the center of a face of the Bravais lattice then we expect it to leave the Bravais lattice invariant Hence it must be a rotation by an integer multiple of 2pB We conclude that 2 p n2 pB E4 or pB n p E5 with an integer n 1 Taken together conditions E3 and E5 yield a small number of possible candidate p q lattices for a given Bravais lattice pB qB The possible values for p are bounded from above by p pB and the maximal values for q that need to be considered are eectively limited from above by Eq E3 After the candidate values for p q have been found we apply the distance spectrum method described in App D to probe if the pB qB lat tice is truly the Bravais lattice of the p q lattice This involves nding the correct unit cell which is restricted by a combination of symmetry considerations and the value of V0 All the examples in Tables III and IV have been obtained with this search algorithm 1 NL Balazs and A Voros Chaos on the pseudosphere Phys Rep 143 109 1986
