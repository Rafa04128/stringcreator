Text: The old lady pulled her spectacles down and looked over them about the room; , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: then she put them up and looked out under them. She seldom or never looked , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: THROUGH them for so small a thing as a boy; they were her state pair, the pride , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: of her heart, and were built for "style," not service—she could have seen through a , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: "Well, I lay if I get hold of you I'll—" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: She resurrected nothing but the cat. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I never did see the beat of that boy!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: She went to the open door and stood in it and looked out among the tomato , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: vines and "jimpson" weeds that constituted the garden. No Tom. So she lifted up , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: her voice at an angle calculated for distance and shouted: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Y-o-u-u TOM!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: mysterious diplomacy, and she loved to contemplate her most transparent devices , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: as marvels of low cunning. Said she: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Tom, it was middling warm in school, warn't it?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Yes'm." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Powerful warm, warn't it?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Yes'm." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Didn't you want to go in a-swimming, Tom?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: A bit of a scare shot through Tom—a touch of uncomfortable suspicion. He , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: searched Aunt Polly's face, but it told him nothing. So he said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "No'm—well, not very much." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: The old lady reached out her hand and felt Tom's shirt, and said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "But you ain't too warm now, though." And it flattered her to reflect that she , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: had discovered that the shirt was dry without anybody knowing that that was , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: what she had in her mind. But in spite of her, Tom knew where the wind lay, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: now. So he forestalled what might be the next move: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Some of us pumped on our heads—mine's damp yet. See?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Aunt Polly was vexed to think she had overlooked that bit of circumstantial , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: evidence, and missed a trick. Then she had a new inspiration: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Tom, you didn't have to undo your shirt collar where I sewed it, to pump on , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: your head, did you? Unbutton your jacket!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: The trouble vanished out of Tom's face. He opened his jacket. His shirt collar , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: was securely sewed. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Bother! Well, go 'long with you. I'd made sure you'd played hookey and been a-, Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: swimming. But I forgive ye, Tom. I reckon you're a kind of a singed cat, as the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: saying is—better'n you look. THIS time." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: She was half sorry her sagacity had miscarried, and half glad that Tom had , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: stumbled into obedient conduct for once. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: But Sidney said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Well, now, if I didn't think you sewed his collar with white thread, but it's , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: black." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Why, I did sew it with white! Tom!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: But Tom did not wait for the rest. As he went out at the door he said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Siddy, I'll lick you for that." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: In a safe place Tom examined two large needles which were thrust into the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: lapels of his jacket, and had thread bound about them—one needle carried white , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: thread and the other black. He said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "She'd never noticed if it hadn't been for Sid. Confound it! sometimes she sews , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: it with white, and sometimes she sews it with black. I wish to gee-miny she'd stick , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: to one or t'other—I can't keep the run of 'em. But I bet you I'll lam Sid for that. I'll , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: learn him!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: He was not the Model Boy of the village. He knew the model boy very well , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: though—and loathed him. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Within two minutes, or even less, he had forgotten all his troubles. Not because , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: his troubles were one whit less heavy and bitter to him than a man's are to a man, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: but because a new and powerful interest bore them down and drove them out of , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: his mind for the time—just as men's misfortunes are forgotten in the excitement of , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: new enterprises. This new interest was a valued novelty in whistling, which he , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: had just acquired from a negro, and he was suffering to practise it un-disturbed. It , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: consisted in a peculiar bird-like turn, a sort of liquid warble, produced by , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: touching the tongue to the roof of the mouth at short intervals in the midst of the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: music—the reader probably remembers how to do it, if he has ever been a boy. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Diligence and attention soon gave him the knack of it, and he strode down the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: street with his mouth full of harmony and his soul full of gratitude. He felt much , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: as an astronomer feels who has discovered a new planet—no doubt, as far as , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: strong, deep, unalloyed pleasure is concerned, the advantage was with the boy, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: not the astronomer. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: The summer evenings were long. It was not dark, yet. Presently Tom checked , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: his whistle. A stranger was before him—a boy a shade larger than himself. A new-, Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: comer of any age or either sex was an impressive curiosity in the poor little , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: shabby village of St. Petersburg. This boy was well dressed, too—well dressed on , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: a week-day. This was simply astounding. His cap was a dainty thing, his close-, Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: buttoned blue cloth roundabout was new and natty, and so were his pantaloons. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: He had shoes on—and it was only Friday. He even wore a necktie, a bright bit of , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: ribbon. He had a citified air about him that ate into Tom's vitals. The more Tom , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: stared at the splendid marvel, the higher he turned up his nose at his finery and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the shabbier and shabbier his own outfit seemed to him to grow. Neither boy , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: spoke. If one moved, the other moved—but only sidewise, in a circle; they kept , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: face to face and eye to eye all the time. Finally Tom said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I can lick you!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I'd like to see you try it." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Well, I can do it." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "No you can't, either." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Yes I can." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "No you can't." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I can." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "You can't." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Can!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Can't!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: An uncomfortable pause. Then Tom said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "What's your name?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "'Tisn't any of your business, maybe." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Well I 'low I'll MAKE it my business." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Well why don't you?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "If you say much, I will." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Much—much—MUCH. There now." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Oh, you think you're mighty smart, DON'T you? I could lick you with one hand , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: tied behind me, if I wanted to." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Well why don't you DO it? You SAY you can do it." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Well I WILL, if you fool with me." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Oh yes—I've seen whole families in the same fix." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Smarty! You think you're SOME, now, DON'T you? Oh, what a hat!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "You can lump that hat if you don't like it. I dare you to knock it off—and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: anybody that'll take a dare will suck eggs." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "You're a liar!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "You're another." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "You're a fighting liar and dasn't take it up." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Aw—take a walk!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Say—if you give me much more of your sass I'll take and bounce a rock off'n , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: your head." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Oh, of COURSE you will." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Well I WILL." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Well why don't you DO it then? What do you keep SAYING you will for? Why , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: don't you DO it? It's because you're afraid." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I AIN'T afraid." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "You are." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I ain't." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "You are." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Another pause, and more eying and sidling around each other. Presently they , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: were shoulder to shoulder. Tom said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Get away from here!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Go away yourself!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I won't." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I won't either." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: So they stood, each with a foot placed at an angle as a brace, and both shoving , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: The new boy took two broad coppers out of his pocket and held them out with , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: CHAPTER III , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Bold, Size: 18.0
Text: TOM presented himself before Aunt Polly, who was sitting by an open window , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: in a pleasant rearward apartment, which was bedroom, breakfast-room, dining-, Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: room, and library, combined. The balmy summer air, the restful quiet, the odor of , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the flowers, and the drowsing murmur of the bees had had their effect, and she , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: was nodding over her knitting—for she had no company but the cat, and it was , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: asleep in her lap. Her spectacles were propped up on her gray head for safety. She , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: had thought that of course Tom had deserted long ago, and she wondered at , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: seeing him place himself in her power again in this intrepid way. He said: "Mayn't , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: I go and play now, aunt?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "What, a'ready? How much have you done?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "It's all done, aunt." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Tom, don't lie to me—I can't bear it." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I ain't, aunt; it IS all done." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Aunt Polly placed small trust in such evidence. She went out to see for herself; , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and she would have been content to find twenty per cent. of Tom's statement , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: true. When she found the entire fence white-washed, and not only whitewashed , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: but elaborately coated and recoated, and even a streak added to the ground, her , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: astonishment was almost unspeakable. She said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Well, I never! There's no getting round it, you can work when you're a mind to, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Tom." And then she diluted the compliment by adding, "But it's powerful seldom , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: you're a mind to, I'm bound to say. Well, go 'long and play; but mind you get back , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: some time in a week, or I'll tan you." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: She was so overcome by the splendor of his achievement that she took him into , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the closet and selected a choice apple and delivered it to him, along with an , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: improving lecture upon the added value and flavor a treat took to itself when it , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: came without sin through virtuous effort. And while she closed with a happy , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Scriptural flourish, he "hooked" a doughnut. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Then he skipped out, and saw Sid just starting up the outside stairway that led , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: to the back rooms on the second floor. Clods were handy and the air was full of , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: them in a twinkling. They raged around Sid like a hail-storm; and before Aunt , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Polly could collect her surprised faculties and sally to the rescue, six or seven , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: clods had taken personal effect, and Tom was over the fence and gone. There was , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: a gate, but as a general thing he was too crowded for time to make use of it. His , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: soul was at peace, now that he had settled with Sid for calling attention to his , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: black thread and getting him into trouble. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Tom skirted the block, and came round into a muddy alley that led by the back , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: of his aunt's cow-stable. He presently got safely beyond the reach of capture and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: punishment, and hastened toward the public square of the village, where two , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "military" companies of boys had met for conflict, according to previous , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: appointment. Tom was General of one of these armies, Joe Harper (a bosom , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: friend) General of the other. These two great commanders did not condescend to , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: fight in person—that being better suited to the still smaller fry—but sat together , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: on an eminence and conducted the field operations by orders delivered through , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: aides-de-camp. Tom's army won a great victory, after a long and hard-fought , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: battle. Then the dead were counted, prisoners exchanged, the terms of the next , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: disagreement agreed upon, and the day for the necessary battle appointed; after , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: which the armies fell into line and marched away, and Tom turned homeward , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: alone. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: As he was passing by the house where Jeff Thatcher lived, he saw a new girl in , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the garden—a lovely little blue-eyed creature with yellow hair plaited into two , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: long-tails, white summer frock and embroidered pantalettes. The fresh-crowned , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: hero fell without firing a shot. A certain Amy Lawrence vanished out of his heart , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and left not even a memory of herself behind. He had thought he loved her to , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: distraction; he had regarded his passion as adoration; and behold it was only a , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: poor little evanescent partiality. He had been months winning her; she had , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: confessed hardly a week ago; he had been the happiest and the proudest boy in , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the world only seven short days, and here in one instant of time she had gone out , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: of his heart like a casual stranger whose visit is done. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: He worshipped this new angel with furtive eye, till he saw that she had , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: discovered him; then he pretended he did not know she was present, and began to , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "show off" in all sorts of absurd boyish ways, in order to win her admiration. He , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: kept up this grotesque foolishness for some time; but by-and-by, while he was in , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the midst of some dangerous gymnastic performances, he glanced aside and saw , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: that the little girl was wending her way toward the house. Tom came up to the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: fence and leaned on it, grieving, and hoping she would tarry yet awhile longer. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: She halted a moment on the steps and then moved toward the door. Tom heaved , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: a great sigh as she put her foot on the threshold. But his face lit up, right away, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: for she tossed a pansy over the fence a moment before she disappeared. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: The boy ran around and stopped within a foot or two of the flower, and then , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: shaded his eyes with his hand and began to look down street as if he had , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: discovered something of interest going on in that direction. Presently he picked up , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: a straw and began trying to balance it on his nose, with his head tilted far back; , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and as he moved from side to side, in his efforts, he edged nearer and nearer , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: toward the pansy; finally his bare foot rested upon it, his pliant toes closed upon , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: it, and he hopped away with the treasure and disappeared round the corner. But , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: only for a minute—only while he could button the flower inside his jacket, next , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: his heart—or next his stomach, possibly, for he was not much posted in anatomy, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and not hypercritical, anyway. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: He returned, now, and hung about the fence till nightfall, "showing off," as , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: before; but the girl never exhibited herself again, though Tom comforted himself a , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: little with the hope that she had been near some window, meantime, and been , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: aware of his attentions. Finally he strode home reluctantly, with his poor head full , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: of visions. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: All through supper his spirits were so high that his aunt wondered "what had , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: got into the child." He took a good scolding about clodding Sid, and did not seem , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: to mind it in the least. He tried to steal sugar under his aunt's very nose, and got , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: his knuckles rapped for it. He said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Aunt, you don't whack Sid when he takes it." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Well, Sid don't torment a body the way you do. You'd be always into that sugar , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: if I warn't watching you." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Presently she stepped into the kitchen, and Sid, happy in his immunity, reached , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: for the sugar-bowl—a sort of glorying over Tom which was wellnigh unbearable. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: But Sid's fingers slipped and the bowl dropped and broke. Tom was in ecstasies. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: In such ecstasies that he even controlled his tongue and was silent. He said to , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: himself that he would not speak a word, even when his aunt came in, but would , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: sit perfectly still till she asked who did the mischief; and then he would tell, and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: there would be nothing so good in the world as to see that pet model "catch it." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: He was so brimful of exultation that he could hardly hold himself when the old , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: lady came back and stood above the wreck discharging lightnings of wrath from , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: over her spectacles. He said to himself, "Now it's coming!" And the next instant he , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: was sprawling on the floor! The potent palm was uplifted to strike again when , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Tom cried out: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Hold on, now, what 'er you belting ME for?—Sid broke it!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Aunt Polly paused, perplexed, and Tom looked for healing pity. But when she , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: got her tongue again, she only said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Umf! Well, you didn't get a lick amiss, I reckon. You been into some other , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: audacious mischief when I wasn't around, like enough." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Then her conscience reproached her, and she yearned to say something kind , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and loving; but she judged that this would be construed into a confession that she , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: had been in the wrong, and discipline forbade that. So she kept silence, and went , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: about her affairs with a troubled heart. Tom sulked in a corner and exalted his , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: woes. He knew that in her heart his aunt was on her knees to him, and he was , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: morosely gratified by the consciousness of it. He would hang out no signals, he , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: would take notice of none. He knew that a yearning glance fell upon him, now , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and then, through a film of tears, but he refused recognition of it. He pictured , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: himself lying sick unto death and his aunt bending over him beseeching one little , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: forgiving word, but he would turn his face to the wall, and die with that word , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: unsaid. Ah, how would she feel then? And he pictured himself brought home from , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the river, dead, with his curls all wet, and his sore heart at rest. How she would , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: throw herself upon him, and how her tears would fall like rain, and her lips pray , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: God to give her back her boy and she would never, never abuse him any more! , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: But he would lie there cold and white and make no sign—a poor little sufferer, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: whose griefs were at an end. He so worked upon his feelings with the pathos of , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: these dreams, that he had to keep swallowing, he was so like to choke; and his , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: eyes swam in a blur of water, which overflowed when he winked, and ran down , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and trickled from the end of his nose. And such a luxury to him was this petting , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: of his sorrows, that he could not bear to have any worldly cheeriness or any , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: grating delight intrude upon it; it was too sacred for such contact; and so, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: presently, when his cousin Mary danced in, all alive with the joy of seeing home , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: again after an age-long visit of one week to the country, he got up and moved in , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: clouds and darkness out at one door as she brought song and sunshine in at the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: other. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: He wandered far from the accustomed haunts of boys, and sought desolate , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: places that were in harmony with his spirit. A log raft in the river invited him, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and he seated himself on its outer edge and contemplated the dreary vastness of , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the stream, wishing, the while, that he could only be drowned, all at once and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: unconsciously, without undergoing the uncomfortable routine devised by nature. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Then he thought of his flower. He got it out, rumpled and wilted, and it mightily , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: increased his dismal felicity. He wondered if she would pity him if she knew? , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Would she cry, and wish that she had a right to put her arms around his neck and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: comfort him? Or would she turn coldly away like all the hollow world? This , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: picture brought such an agony of pleasurable suffering that he worked it over and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: over again in his mind and set it up in new and varied lights, till he wore it , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: threadbare. At last he rose up sighing and departed in the darkness. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: About half-past nine or ten o'clock he came along the deserted street to where , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the Adored Unknown lived; he paused a moment; no sound fell upon his listening , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: ear; a candle was casting a dull glow upon the curtain of a second-story window. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Was the sacred presence there? He climbed the fence, threaded his stealthy way , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: through the plants, till he stood under that window; he looked up at it long, and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: with emotion; then he laid him down on the ground under it, disposing himself , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: upon his back, with his hands clasped upon his breast and holding his poor wilted , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: flower. And thus he would die—out in the cold world, with no shelter over his , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: homeless head, no friendly hand to wipe the death-damps from his brow, no , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: loving face to bend pityingly over him when the great agony came. And thus SHE , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: would see him when she looked out upon the glad morning, and oh! would she , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: drop one little tear upon his poor, lifeless form, would she heave one little sigh to , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: see a bright young life so rudely blighted, so untimely cut down? , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: The window went up, a maid-servant's discordant voice profaned the holy calm, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and a deluge of water drenched the prone martyr's remains! , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: The strangling hero sprang up with a relieving snort. There was a whiz as of a , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: missile in the air, mingled with the murmur of a curse, a sound as of shivering , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: glass followed, and a small, vague form went over the fence and shot away in the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: gloom. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Not long after, as Tom, all undressed for bed, was surveying his drenched , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: water and laid it down; turned up his sleeves; poured out the water on the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: ground, gently, and then entered the kitchen and began to wipe his face diligently , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: on the towel behind the door. But Mary removed the towel and said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Now ain't you ashamed, Tom. You mustn't be so bad. Water won't hurt you." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Tom was a trifle disconcerted. The basin was refilled, and this time he stood , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: over it a little while, gathering resolution; took in a big breath and began. When , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: he entered the kitchen presently, with both eyes shut and groping for the towel , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: with his hands, an honorable testimony of suds and water was dripping from his , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: clean territory stopped short at his chin and his jaws, like a mask; below and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: beyond this line there was a dark expanse of unirrigated soil that spread , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: downward in front and backward around his neck. Mary took him in hand, and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: when she was done with him he was a man and a brother, without distinction of , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: color, and his saturated hair was neatly brushed, and its short curls wrought into , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: a dainty and symmetrical general effect. [He privately smoothed out the curls, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: with labor and difficulty, and plastered his hair close down to his head; for he , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: held curls to be effeminate, and his own filled his life with bitterness.] Then Mary , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: got out a suit of his clothing that had been used only on Sundays during two , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: years—they were simply called his "other clothes"—and so by that we know the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: size of his wardrobe. The girl "put him to rights" after he had dressed himself; she , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: buttoned his neat roundabout up to his chin, turned his vast shirt collar down , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: over his shoulders, brushed him off and crowned him with his speckled straw hat. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: He now looked exceedingly improved and uncomfortable. He was fully as , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: uncomfortable as he looked; for there was a restraint about whole clothes and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: cleanliness that galled him. He hoped that Mary would forget his shoes, but the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: hope was blighted; she coated them thoroughly with tallow, as was the custom, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and brought them out. He lost his temper and said he was always being made to , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: "Please, Tom—that's a good boy." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: So he got into the shoes snarling. Mary was soon ready, and the three children , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: set out for Sunday-school—a place that Tom hated with his whole heart; but Sid , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text:  , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Tom exhibited. They were satisfactory, and the property changed hands. Then , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Tom traded a couple of white alleys for three red tickets, and some small trifle or , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: other for a couple of blue ones. He waylaid other boys as they came, and went on , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: buying tickets of various colors ten or fifteen minutes longer. He entered the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: church, now, with a swarm of clean and noisy boys and girls, proceeded to his , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: seat and started a quarrel with the first boy that came handy. The teacher, a , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: grave, elderly man, interfered; then turned his back a moment and Tom pulled a , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: boy's hair in the next bench, and was absorbed in his book when the boy turned , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: around; stuck a pin in another boy, presently, in order to hear him say "Ouch!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and got a new reprimand from his teacher. Tom's whole class were of a pattern—, Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: restless, noisy, and troublesome. When they came to recite their lessons, not one , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: of them knew his verses perfectly, but had to be prompted all along. However, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: they worried through, and each got his reward—in small blue tickets, each with a , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: passage of Scripture on it; each blue ticket was pay for two verses of the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: recitation. Ten blue tickets equalled a red one, and could be exchanged for it; ten , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: red tickets equalled a yellow one; for ten yellow tickets the superintendent gave a , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: very plainly bound Bible (worth forty cents in those easy times) to the pupil. How , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: many of my readers would have the industry and application to memorize two , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: this way—it was the patient work of two years—and a boy of German parentage , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: had won four or five. He once recited three thousand verses without stopping; but , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the strain upon his mental faculties was too great, and he was little better than an , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: occasions, before company, the superintendent (as Tom expressed it) had always , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: made this boy come out and "spread himself." Only the older pupils managed to , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text:  , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: fence that compelled a straight lookout ahead, and a turning of the whole body , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: when a side view was required; his chin was propped on a spreading cravat which , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: was as broad and as long as a bank-note, and had fringed ends; his boot toes were , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: patiently and laboriously produced by the young men by sitting with their toes , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: pressed against a wall for hours together. Mr. Walters was very earnest of mien, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and very sincere and honest at heart; and he held sacred things and places in such , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: reverence, and so separated them from worldly matters, that unconsciously to , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: himself his Sunday-school voice had acquired a peculiar intonation which was , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: wholly absent on week-days. He began after this fashion: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Now, children, I want you all to sit up just as straight and pretty as you can , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and give me all your attention for a minute or two. There—that is it. That is the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: way good little boys and girls should do. I see one little girl who is looking out of , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: tell you how good it makes me feel to see so many bright, clean little faces , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: assembled in a place like this, learning to do right and be good." And so forth and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: so on. It is not necessary to set down the rest of the oration. It was of a pattern , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: which does not vary, and so it is familiar to us all. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: The latter third of the speech was marred by the resumption of fights and other , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: recreations among certain of the bad boys, and by fidgetings and whisperings that , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: extended far and wide, washing even to the bases of isolated and incorruptible , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: rocks like Sid and Mary. But now every sound ceased suddenly, with the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: subsidence of Mr. Walters' voice, and the conclusion of the speech was received , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: with a burst of silent gratitude. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: A good part of the whispering had been occasioned by an event which was more , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: or less rare—the entrance of visitors: lawyer Thatcher, accompanied by a very , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: feeble and aged man; a fine, portly, middle-aged gentleman with iron-gray hair; , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and a dignified lady who was doubtless the latter's wife. The lady was leading a , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: smitten, too—he could not meet Amy Lawrence's eye, he could not brook her , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: loving gaze. But when he saw this small newcomer his soul was all ablaze with , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: cuffing boys, pulling hair, making faces—in a word, using every art that seemed , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: the memory of his humiliation in this angel's garden—and that record in sand was , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: fast washing out, under the waves of happiness that were sweeping over it now. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: The visitors were given the highest seat of honor, and as soon as Mr. Walters' , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: speech was finished, he introduced them to the school. The middle-aged man , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: turned out to be a prodigious personage—no less a one than the county judge—, Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: altogether the most august creation these children had ever looked upon—and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: they wondered what kind of material he was made of—and they half wanted to , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: hear him roar, and were half afraid he might, too. He was from Constantinople, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: twelve miles away—so he had travelled, and seen the world—these very eyes had , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: looked upon the county court-house—which was said to have a tin roof. The awe , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: which these reflections inspired was attested by the impressive silence and the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: ranks of staring eyes. This was the great Judge Thatcher, brother of their own , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: lawyer. Jeff Thatcher immediately went forward, to be familiar with the great man , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and be envied by the school. It would have been music to his soul to hear the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: activities, giving orders, delivering judgments, discharging directions here, there, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: and thither with his arms full of books and making a deal of the splutter and fuss , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: that insect authority delights in. The young lady teachers "showed off"—bending , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: sweetly over pupils that were lately being boxed, lifting pretty warning fingers at , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: over again two or three times (with much seeming vexation). The little girls , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "showed off" in various ways, and the little boys "showed off" with such diligence , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: that the air was thick with paper wads and the murmur of scufflings. And above it , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: all the great man sat and beamed a majestic judicial smile upon all the house, and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: There was only one thing wanting to make Mr. Walters' ecstasy complete, and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: that was a chance to deliver a Bible-prize and exhibit a prodigy. Several pupils had , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: a few yellow tickets, but none had enough—he had been around among the star , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: And now at this moment, when hope was dead, Tom Sawyer came forward with , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: nine yellow tickets, nine red tickets, and ten blue ones, and demanded a Bible. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: This was a thunderbolt out of a clear sky. Walters was not expecting an , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: laggards and stragglers, and then a solemn hush fell upon the church which was , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: only broken by the tittering and whispering of the choir in the gallery. The choir , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: After the hymn had been sung, the Rev. Mr. Sprague turned himself into a , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: European monarchies and Oriental despotisms; for such as have the light and the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: good tidings, and yet have not eyes to see nor ears to hear withal; for the heathen , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: in the far islands of the sea; and closed with a supplication that the words he was , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: about to speak might find grace and favor, and be as seed sown in fertile ground, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: yielding in time a grateful harvest of good. Amen. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: There was a rustling of dresses, and the standing congregation sat down. The , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: boy whose history this book relates did not enjoy the prayer, he only endured it—, Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: if he even did that much. He was restive all through it; he kept tally of the details , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: of the prayer, unconsciously—for he was not listening, but he knew the ground of , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: old, and the clergyman's regular route over it—and when a little trifle of new , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: matter was interlarded, his ear detected it and his whole nature resented it; he , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: considered additions unfair, and scoundrelly. In the midst of the prayer a fly had , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: lit on the back of the pew in front of him and tortured his spirit by calmly rubbing , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: its hands together, embracing its head with its arms, and polishing it so , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: vigorously that it seemed to almost part company with the body, and the slender , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: thread of a neck was exposed to view; scraping its wings with its hind legs and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: smoothing them to its body as if they had been coat-tails; going through its whole , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: toilet as tranquilly as if it knew it was perfectly safe. As indeed it was; for as , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: sorely as Tom's hands itched to grab for it they did not dare—he believed his soul , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: would be instantly destroyed if he did such a thing while the prayer was going on. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: But with the closing sentence his hand began to curve and steal forward; and the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: instant the "Amen" was out the fly was a prisoner of war. His aunt detected the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: The minister gave out his text and droned along monotonously through an , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: argument that was so prosy that many a head by and by began to nod—and yet it , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: was an argument that dealt in limitless fire and brimstone and thinned the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: predestined elect down to a company so small as to be hardly worth the saving. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Tom counted the pages of the sermon; after church he always knew how many , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: pages there had been, but he seldom knew anything else about the discourse. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: However, this time he was really interested for a little while. The minister made a , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: grand and moving picture of the assembling together of the world's hosts at the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: millennium when the lion and the lamb should lie down together and a little child , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: should lead them. But the pathos, the lesson, the moral of the great spectacle , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: were lost upon the boy; he only thought of the conspicuousness of the principal , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: character before the on-looking nations; his face lit with the thought, and he said , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: to himself that he wished he could be that child, if it was a tame lion. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Now he lapsed into suffering again, as the dry argument was resumed. Presently , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: he bethought him of a treasure he had and got it out. It was a large black beetle , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: with formidable jaws—a "pinchbug," he called it. It was in a percussion-cap box. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: The first thing the beetle did was to take him by the finger. A natural fillip , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: followed, the beetle went floundering into the aisle and lit on its back, and the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: hurt finger went into the boy's mouth. The beetle lay there working its helpless , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: legs, unable to turn over. Tom eyed it, and longed for it; but it was safe out of his , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: reach. Other people uninterested in the sermon found relief in the beetle, and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: they eyed it too. Presently a vagrant poodle dog came idling along, sad at heart, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: lazy with the summer softness and the quiet, weary of captivity, sighing for , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: change. He spied the beetle; the drooping tail lifted and wagged. He surveyed the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: prize; walked around it; smelt at it from a safe distance; walked around it again; , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: grew bolder, and took a closer smell; then lifted his lip and made a gingerly , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: snatch at it, just missing it; made another, and another; began to enjoy the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: diversion; subsided to his stomach with the beetle between his paws, and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: continued his experiments; grew weary at last, and then indifferent and absent-, Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: minded. His head nodded, and little by little his chin descended and touched the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: enemy, who seized it. There was a sharp yelp, a flirt of the poodle's head, and the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: beetle fell a couple of yards away, and lit on its back once more. The neighboring , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: spectators shook with a gentle inward joy, several faces went behind fans and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: hand-kerchiefs, and Tom was entirely happy. The dog looked foolish, and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: probably felt so; but there was resentment in his heart, too, and a craving for , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: revenge. So he went to the beetle and began a wary attack on it again; jumping at , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: it from every point of a circle, lighting with his fore-paws within an inch of the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: creature, making even closer snatches at it with his teeth, and jerking his head till , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: his ears flapped again. But he grew tired once more, after a while; tried to amuse , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: himself with a fly but found no relief; followed an ant around, with his nose close , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: to the floor, and quickly wearied of that; yawned, sighed, forgot the beetle , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: entirely, and sat down on it. Then there was a wild yelp of agony and the poodle , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: went sailing up the aisle; the yelps continued, and so did the dog; he crossed the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: house in front of the altar; he flew down the other aisle; he crossed before the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: doors; he clamored up the home-stretch; his anguish grew with his progress, till , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: presently he was but a woolly comet moving in its orbit with the gleam and the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: speed of light. At last the frantic sufferer sheered from its course, and sprang into , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: its master's lap; he flung it out of the window, and the voice of distress quickly , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: thinned away and died in the distance. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: By this time the whole church was red-faced and suffocating with suppressed , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: laughter, and the sermon had come to a dead standstill. The discourse was , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: resumed presently, but it went lame and halting, all possibility of impressiveness , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: being at an end; for even the gravest sentiments were constantly being received , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: with a smothered burst of unholy mirth, under cover of some remote pew-back, as , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: further. Suddenly he discovered something. One of his upper front teeth was , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: loose. This was lucky; he was about to begin to groan, as a "starter," as he called , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: it, when it occurred to him that if he came into court with that argument, his aunt , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: would pull it out, and that would hurt. So he thought he would hold the tooth in , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: reserve for the present, and seek further. Nothing offered for some little time, and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: then he remembered hearing the doctor tell about a certain thing that laid up a , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: patient for two or three weeks and threatened to make him lose a finger. So the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: boy eagerly drew his sore toe from under the sheet and held it up for inspection. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: But now he did not know the necessary symptoms. However, it seemed well , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: worth while to chance it, so he fell to groaning with considerable spirit. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: But Sid slept on unconscious. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Tom groaned louder, and fancied that he began to feel pain in the toe. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: No result from Sid. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Tom was panting with his exertions by this time. He took a rest and then , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: swelled himself up and fetched a succession of admirable groans. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Sid snored on. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Tom was aggravated. He said, "Sid, Sid!" and shook him. This course worked , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: well, and Tom began to groan again. Sid yawned, stretched, then brought himself , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: up on his elbow with a snort, and began to stare at Tom. Tom went on groaning. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Sid said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Tom! Say, Tom!" [No response.] "Here, Tom! TOM! What is the matter, Tom?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: And he shook him and looked in his face anxiously. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Tom moaned out: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Oh, don't, Sid. Don't joggle me." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Why, what's the matter, Tom? I must call auntie." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "No—never mind. It'll be over by and by, maybe. Don't call anybody." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "But I must! DON'T groan so, Tom, it's awful. How long you been this way?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Hours. Ouch! Oh, don't stir so, Sid, you'll kill me." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Tom, why didn't you wake me sooner? Oh, Tom, DON'T! It makes my flesh , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: tell her—" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: But Sid had snatched his clothes and gone. Tom was suffering in reality, now, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: so handsomely was his imagination working, and so his groans had gathered quite , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: a genuine tone. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Sid flew downstairs and said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Oh, Aunt Polly, come! Tom's dying!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Dying!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: But she fled upstairs, nevertheless, with Sid and Mary at her heels. And her , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: face grew white, too, and her lip trembled. When she reached the bedside she , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: gasped out: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "You, Tom! Tom, what's the matter with you?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Oh, auntie, I'm—" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "What's the matter with you—what is the matter with you, child?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Oh, auntie, my sore toe's mortified!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: The old lady sank down into a chair and laughed a little, then cried a little, then , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: did both together. This restored her and she said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Tom, what a turn you did give me. Now you shut up that nonsense and climb , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: out of this." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: The groans ceased and the pain vanished from the toe. The boy felt a little , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: foolish, and he said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Aunt Polly, it SEEMED mortified, and it hurt so I never minded my tooth at , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: "There, there, now, don't begin that groaning again. Open your mouth. Well—, Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: your tooth IS loose, but you're not going to die about that. Mary, get me a silk , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: thread, and a chunk of fire out of the kitchen." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Tom said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Oh, please, auntie, don't pull it out. It don't hurt any more. I wish I may never , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text:  , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Oh, you don't, don't you? So all this row was because you thought you'd get to , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: stay home from school and go a-fishing? Tom, Tom, I love you so, and you seem , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: to try every way you can to break my old heart with your outrageousness." By this , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: time the dental instruments were ready. The old lady made one end of the silk , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: thread fast to Tom's tooth with a loop and tied the other to the bedpost. Then she , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: seized the chunk of fire and suddenly thrust it almost into the boy's face. The , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: tooth hung dangling by the bedpost, now. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: But all trials bring their compensations. As Tom wended to school after , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: breakfast, he was the envy of every boy he met because the gap in his upper row , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: of teeth enabled him to expectorate in a new and admirable way. He gathered , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: quite a following of lads interested in the exhibition; and one that had cut his , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: finger and had been a centre of fascination and homage up to this time, now , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: found himself suddenly without an adherent, and shorn of his glory. His heart , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: was heavy, and he said with a disdain which he did not feel that it wasn't , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: anything to spit like Tom Sawyer; but another boy said, "Sour grapes!" and he , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: wandered away a dismantled hero. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Shortly Tom came upon the juvenile pariah of the village, Huckleberry Finn, son , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: of the town drunkard. Huckleberry was cordially hated and dreaded by all the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: mothers of the town, because he was idle and lawless and vulgar and bad—and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: because all their children admired him so, and delighted in his forbidden society, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and wished they dared to be like him. Tom was like the rest of the respectable , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: boys, in that he envied Huckleberry his gaudy outcast condition, and was under , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: strict orders not to play with him. So he played with him every time he got a , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: chance. Huckleberry was always dressed in the cast-off clothes of full-grown men, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and they were in perennial bloom and fluttering with rags. His hat was a vast ruin , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: with a wide crescent lopped out of its brim; his coat, when he wore one, hung , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: nearly to his heels and had the rearward buttons far down the back; but one , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: suspender supported his trousers; the seat of the trousers bagged low and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: contained nothing, the fringed legs dragged in the dirt when not rolled up. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Huckleberry came and went, at his own free will. He slept on doorsteps in fine , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: weather and in empty hogsheads in wet; he did not have to go to school or to , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: church, or call any being master or obey anybody; he could go fishing or , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: swimming when and where he chose, and stay as long as it suited him; nobody , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: that form was THE ONLY VACANT PLACE on the girls' side of the school-house. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: He instantly said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I STOPPED TO TALK WITH HUCKLEBERRY FINN!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: The master's pulse stood still, and he stared helplessly. The buzz of study , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: ceased. The pupils wondered if this foolhardy boy had lost his mind. The master , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "You—you did what?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Stopped to talk with Huckleberry Finn." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: There was no mistaking the words. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Thomas Sawyer, this is the most astounding confession I have ever listened to. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: No mere ferule will answer for this offence. Take off your jacket." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: The master's arm performed until it was tired and the stock of switches notably , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: diminished. Then the order followed: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Now, sir, go and sit with the girls! And let this be a warning to you." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: The titter that rippled around the room appeared to abash the boy, but in , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: reality that result was caused rather more by his worshipful awe of his unknown , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: idol and the dread pleasure that lay in his high good fortune. He sat down upon , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the end of the pine bench and the girl hitched herself away from him with a toss , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: of her head. Nudges and winks and whispers traversed the room, but Tom sat , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: still, with his arms upon the long, low desk before him, and seemed to study his , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: book. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: By and by attention ceased from him, and the accustomed school murmur rose , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: upon the dull air once more. Presently the boy began to steal furtive glances at the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: girl. She observed it, "made a mouth" at him and gave him the back of her head , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: for the space of a minute. When she cautiously faced around again, a peach lay , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: before her. She thrust it away. Tom gently put it back. She thrust it away again, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: but with less animosity. Tom patiently returned it to its place. Then she let it , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: remain. Tom scrawled on his slate, "Please take it—I got more." The girl glanced , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: at the words, but made no sign. Now the boy began to draw something on the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: slate, hiding his work with his left hand. For a time the girl refused to notice; but , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: her human curiosity presently began to manifest itself by hardly perceptible signs. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: The boy worked on, apparently unconscious. The girl made a sort of non-, Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: committal attempt to see, but the boy did not betray that he was aware of it. At , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: last she gave in and hesitatingly whispered: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Let me see it." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Tom partly uncovered a dismal caricature of a house with two gable ends to it , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and a corkscrew of smoke issuing from the chimney. Then the girl's interest began , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: to fasten itself upon the work and she forgot everything else. When it was , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: finished, she gazed a moment, then whispered: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "It's nice—make a man." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: The artist erected a man in the front yard, that resembled a derrick. He could , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: have stepped over the house; but the girl was not hypercritical; she was satisfied , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: with the monster, and whispered: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "It's a beautiful man—now make me coming along." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Tom drew an hour-glass with a full moon and straw limbs to it and armed the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: spreading fingers with a portentous fan. The girl said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "It's ever so nice—I wish I could draw." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "It's easy," whispered Tom, "I'll learn you." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Oh, will you? When?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "At noon. Do you go home to dinner?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I'll stay if you will." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Good—that's a whack. What's your name?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Becky Thatcher. What's yours? Oh, I know. It's Thomas Sawyer." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "That's the name they lick me by. I'm Tom when I'm good. You call me Tom, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: will you?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Yes." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Now Tom began to scrawl something on the slate, hiding the words from the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: girl. But she was not backward this time. She begged to see. Tom said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Oh, it ain't anything." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Yes it is." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "No it ain't. You don't want to see." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Yes I do, indeed I do. Please let me." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "You'll tell." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "No I won't—deed and deed and double deed won't." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "You won't tell anybody at all? Ever, as long as you live?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "No, I won't ever tell ANYbody. Now let me." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Oh, YOU don't want to see!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Now that you treat me so, I WILL see." And she put her small hand upon his , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and a little scuffle ensued, Tom pretending to resist in earnest but letting his hand , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: slip by degrees till these words were revealed: "I LOVE YOU." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Oh, you bad thing!" And she hit his hand a smart rap, but reddened and looked , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: pleased, nevertheless. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Just at this juncture the boy felt a slow, fateful grip closing on his ear, and a , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: steady lifting impulse. In that wise he was borne across the house and deposited , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: in his own seat, under a peppering fire of giggles from the whole school. Then the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: master stood over him during a few awful moments, and finally moved away to , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: his throne without saying a word. But although Tom's ear tingled, his heart was , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: jubilant. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: As the school quieted down Tom made an honest effort to study, but the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: turmoil within him was too great. In turn he took his place in the reading class , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and made a botch of it; then in the geography class and turned lakes into , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: mountains, mountains into rivers, and rivers into continents, till chaos was come , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: again; then in the spelling class, and got "turned down," by a succession of mere , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: CHAPTER VII , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Bold, Size: 18.0
Text: THE harder Tom tried to fasten his mind on his book, the more his ideas , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: wandered. So at last, with a sigh and a yawn, he gave it up. It seemed to him that , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the noon recess would never come. The air was utterly dead. There was not a , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: breath stirring. It was the sleepiest of sleepy days. The drowsing murmur of the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: five and twenty studying scholars soothed the soul like the spell that is in the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: murmur of bees. Away off in the flaming sunshine, Cardiff Hill lifted its soft green , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: sides through a shimmering veil of heat, tinted with the purple of distance; a few , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: birds floated on lazy wing high in the air; no other living thing was visible but , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: some cows, and they were asleep. Tom's heart ached to be free, or else to have , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: something of interest to do to pass the dreary time. His hand wandered into his , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: pocket and his face lit up with a glow of gratitude that was prayer, though he did , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: not know it. Then furtively the percussion-cap box came out. He released the tick , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and put him on the long flat desk. The creature probably glowed with a gratitude , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: that amounted to prayer, too, at this moment, but it was premature: for when he , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: started thankfully to travel off, Tom turned him aside with a pin and made him , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: take a new direction. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Tom's bosom friend sat next him, suffering just as Tom had been, and now he , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: was deeply and gratefully interested in this entertainment in an instant. This , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: bosom friend was Joe Harper. The two boys were sworn friends all the week, and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: embattled enemies on Saturdays. Joe took a pin out of his lapel and began to , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: assist in exercising the prisoner. The sport grew in interest momently. Soon Tom , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: said that they were interfering with each other, and neither getting the fullest , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: benefit of the tick. So he put Joe's slate on the desk and drew a line down the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: middle of it from top to bottom. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Now," said he, "as long as he is on your side you can stir him up and I'll let him , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: alone; but if you let him get away and get on my side, you're to leave him alone as , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: long as I can keep him from crossing over." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "All right, go ahead; start him up." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: The tick escaped from Tom, presently, and crossed the equator. Joe harassed , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: him awhile, and then he got away and crossed back again. This change of base , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: occurred often. While one boy was worrying the tick with absorbing interest, the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: other would look on with interest as strong, the two heads bowed together over , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the slate, and the two souls dead to all things else. At last luck seemed to settle , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and abide with Joe. The tick tried this, that, and the other course, and got as , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: excited and as anxious as the boys themselves, but time and again just as he , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: would have victory in his very grasp, so to speak, and Tom's fingers would be , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: twitching to begin, Joe's pin would deftly head him off, and keep possession. At , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: last Tom could stand it no longer. The temptation was too strong. So he reached , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: out and lent a hand with his pin. Joe was angry in a moment. Said he: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Tom, you let him alone." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I only just want to stir him up a little, Joe." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "No, sir, it ain't fair; you just let him alone." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Blame it, I ain't going to stir him much." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Let him alone, I tell you." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I won't!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "You shall—he's on my side of the line." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Look here, Joe Harper, whose is that tick?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I don't care whose tick he is—he's on my side of the line, and you sha'n't touch , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: him." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Well, I'll just bet I will, though. He's my tick and I'll do what I blame please , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: with him, or die!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: A tremendous whack came down on Tom's shoulders, and its duplicate on Joe's; , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and for the space of two minutes the dust continued to fly from the two jackets , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and the whole school to enjoy it. The boys had been too absorbed to notice the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: hush that had stolen upon the school awhile before when the master came , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: tiptoeing down the room and stood over them. He had contemplated a good part , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: of the performance before he contributed his bit of variety to it. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: When school broke up at noon, Tom flew to Becky Thatcher, and whispered in , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: her ear: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Put on your bonnet and let on you're going home; and when you get to the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: corner, give the rest of 'em the slip, and turn down through the lane and come , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: back. I'll go the other way and come it over 'em the same way." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: So the one went off with one group of scholars, and the other with another. In a , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: little while the two met at the bottom of the lane, and when they reached the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: school they had it all to themselves. Then they sat together, with a slate before , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: them, and Tom gave Becky the pencil and held her hand in his, guiding it, and so , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: created another surprising house. When the interest in art began to wane, the two , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: fell to talking. Tom was swimming in bliss. He said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Do you love rats?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "No! I hate them!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Well, I do, too—LIVE ones. But I mean dead ones, to swing round your head , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: with a string." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "No, I don't care for rats much, anyway. What I like is chewing-gum." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Oh, I should say so! I wish I had some now." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Do you? I've got some. I'll let you chew it awhile, but you must give it back to , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: me." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: That was agreeable, so they chewed it turn about, and dangled their legs against , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the bench in excess of contentment. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Was you ever at a circus?" said Tom. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Yes, and my pa's going to take me again some time, if I'm good." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I been to the circus three or four times—lots of times. Church ain't shucks to a , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: circus. There's things going on at a circus all the time. I'm going to be a clown in a , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: circus when I grow up." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Oh, are you! That will be nice. They're so lovely, all spotted up." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Yes, that's so. And they get slathers of money—most a dollar a day, Ben Rogers , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: says. Say, Becky, was you ever engaged?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "What's that?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Why, engaged to be married." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "No." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Would you like to?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I reckon so. I don't know. What is it like?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Like? Why it ain't like anything. You only just tell a boy you won't ever have , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: anybody but him, ever ever ever, and then you kiss and that's all. Anybody can do , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: it." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Kiss? What do you kiss for?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Why, that, you know, is to—well, they always do that." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Everybody?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Why, yes, everybody that's in love with each other. Do you remember what I , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: wrote on the slate?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Ye—yes." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "What was it?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I sha'n't tell you." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Shall I tell YOU?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Ye—yes—but some other time." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "No, now." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "No, not now—to-morrow." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Oh, no, NOW. Please, Becky—I'll whisper it, I'll whisper it ever so easy." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Becky hesitating, Tom took silence for consent, and passed his arm about her , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: waist and whispered the tale ever so softly, with his mouth close to her ear. And , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: then he added: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Now you whisper it to me—just the same." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: She resisted, for a while, and then said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "You turn your face away so you can't see, and then I will. But you mustn't ever , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: tell anybody—WILL you, Tom? Now you won't, WILL you?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "No, indeed, indeed I won't. Now, Becky." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: He turned his face away. She bent timidly around till her breath stirred his curls , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and whispered, "I—love—you!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Then she sprang away and ran around and around the desks and benches, with , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Tom after her, and took refuge in a corner at last, with her little white apron to , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: her face. Tom clasped her about her neck and pleaded: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Now, Becky, it's all done—all over but the kiss. Don't you be afraid of that—it , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: ain't anything at all. Please, Becky." And he tugged at her apron and the hands. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: By and by she gave up, and let her hands drop; her face, all glowing with the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: Tom tried to put his arm about her neck, but she pushed him away and turned , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: her face to the wall, and went on crying. Tom tried again, with soothing words in , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: his mouth, and was repulsed again. Then his pride was up, and he strode away , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and went outside. He stood about, restless and uneasy, for a while, glancing at , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the door, every now and then, hoping she would repent and come to find him. But , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: she did not. Then he began to feel badly and fear that he was in the wrong. It was , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: a hard struggle with him to make new advances, now, but he nerved himself to it , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and entered. She was still standing back there in the corner, sobbing, with her , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: face to the wall. Tom's heart smote him. He went to her and stood a moment, not , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: "Becky, I—I don't care for anybody but you." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: No reply—but sobs. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Becky"—pleadingly. "Becky, won't you say something?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: More sobs. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Tom got out his chiefest jewel, a brass knob from the top of an andiron, and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: passed it around her so that she could see it, and said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Please, Becky, won't you take it?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: She struck it to the floor. Then Tom marched out of the house and over the hills , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and far away, to return to school no more that day. Presently Becky began to , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: suspect. She ran to the door; he was not in sight; she flew around to the play-, Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: "Tom! Come back, Tom!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: TOM dodged hither and thither through lanes until he was well out of the track , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: Yes, it was settled; his career was determined. He would run away from home , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and enter upon it. He would start the very next morning. Therefore he must now , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: begin to get ready. He would collect his resources together. He went to a rotten , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: log near at hand and began to dig under one end of it with his Barlow knife. He , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: soon struck wood that sounded hollow. He put his hand there and uttered this , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: incantation impressively: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "What hasn't come here, come! What's here, stay here!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Then he scraped away the dirt, and exposed a pine shingle. He took it up and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: disclosed a shapely little treasure-house whose bottom and sides were of shingles. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: In it lay a marble. Tom's astonishment was bound-less! He scratched his head , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: with a perplexed air, and said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Well, that beats anything!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Then he tossed the marble away pettishly, and stood cogitating. The truth was, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: that a superstition of his had failed, here, which he and all his comrades had , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: always looked upon as infallible. If you buried a marble with certain necessary , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: incantations, and left it alone a fortnight, and then opened the place with the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: incantation he had just used, you would find that all the marbles you had ever , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: lost had gathered themselves together there, meantime, no matter how widely , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: they had been separated. But now, this thing had actually and unquestionably , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: failed. Tom's whole structure of faith was shaken to its foundations. He had many , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: a time heard of this thing succeeding but never of its failing before. It did not , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: occur to him that he had tried it several times before, himself, but could never , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: find the hiding-places afterward. He puzzled over the matter some time, and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: finally decided that some witch had interfered and broken the charm. He thought , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: he would satisfy himself on that point; so he searched around till he found a small , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: sandy spot with a little funnel-shaped depression in it. He laid himself down and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: put his mouth close to this depression and called— , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Doodle-bug, doodle-bug, tell me what I want to know! Doodle-bug, doodle-bug, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: tell me what I want to know!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: The sand began to work, and presently a small black bug appeared for a second , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and then darted under again in a fright. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "He dasn't tell! So it WAS a witch that done it. I just knowed it." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: He well knew the futility of trying to contend against witches, so he gave up , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: discouraged. But it occurred to him that he might as well have the marble he had , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: just thrown away, and therefore he went and made a patient search for it. But he , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: could not find it. Now he went back to his treasure-house and carefully placed , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: himself just as he had been standing when he tossed the marble away; then he , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: took another marble from his pocket and tossed it in the same way, saying: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Brother, go find your brother!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: He watched where it stopped, and went there and looked. But it must have , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: fallen short or gone too far; so he tried twice more. The last repetition was , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: successful. The two marbles lay within a foot of each other. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Just here the blast of a toy tin trumpet came faintly down the green aisles of the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: forest. Tom flung off his jacket and trousers, turned a suspender into a belt, raked , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: away some brush behind the rotten log, disclosing a rude bow and arrow, a lath , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: sword and a tin trumpet, and in a moment had seized these things and bounded , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: away, barelegged, with fluttering shirt. He presently halted under a great elm, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: blew an answering blast, and then began to tiptoe and look warily out, this way , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and that. He said cautiously—to an imaginary company: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Hold, my merry men! Keep hid till I blow." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Now appeared Joe Harper, as airily clad and elaborately armed as Tom. Tom , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: called: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Hold! Who comes here into Sherwood Forest without my pass?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Guy of Guisborne wants no man's pass. Who art thou that—that—" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Dares to hold such language," said Tom, prompting—for they talked "by the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: book," from memory. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Who art thou that dares to hold such language?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I, indeed! I am Robin Hood, as thy caitiff carcase soon shall know." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Then art thou indeed that famous outlaw? Right gladly will I dispute with thee , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the passes of the merry wood. Have at thee!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: They took their lath swords, dumped their other traps on the ground, struck a , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: fencing attitude, foot to foot, and began a grave, careful combat, "two up and two , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: down." Presently Tom said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Now, if you've got the hang, go it lively!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: So they "went it lively," panting and perspiring with the work. By and by Tom , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: shouted: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Fall! fall! Why don't you fall?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I sha'n't! Why don't you fall yourself? You're getting the worst of it." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Why, that ain't anything. I can't fall; that ain't the way it is in the book. The , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: book says, 'Then with one back-handed stroke he slew poor Guy of Guisborne.' , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: You're to turn around and let me hit you in the back." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: There was no getting around the authorities, so Joe turned, received the whack , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and fell. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Now," said Joe, getting up, "you got to let me kill YOU. That's fair." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Why, I can't do that, it ain't in the book." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Well, it's blamed mean—that's all." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Well, say, Joe, you can be Friar Tuck or Much the miller's son, and lam me , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: with a quarter-staff; or I'll be the Sheriff of Nottingham and you be Robin Hood a , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: little while and kill me." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: This was satisfactory, and so these adventures were carried out. Then Tom , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: became Robin Hood again, and was allowed by the treacherous nun to bleed his , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: strength away through his neglected wound. And at last Joe, representing a whole , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: tribe of weeping outlaws, dragged him sadly forth, gave his bow into his feeble , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: hands, and Tom said, "Where this arrow falls, there bury poor Robin Hood under , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the greenwood tree." Then he shot the arrow and fell back and would have died, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: impatience. When it seemed to him that it must be nearly daylight, he heard the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: clock strike ten! This was despair. He would have tossed and fidgeted, as his , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: nerves demanded, but he was afraid he might wake Sid. So he lay still, and stared , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: up into the dark. Everything was dismally still. By and by, out of the stillness, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: little, scarcely perceptible noises began to emphasize themselves. The ticking of , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the clock began to bring itself into notice. Old beams began to crack mysteriously. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: The stairs creaked faintly. Evidently spirits were abroad. A measured, muffled , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: snore issued from Aunt Polly's chamber. And now the tiresome chirping of a , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: cricket that no human ingenuity could locate, began. Next the ghastly ticking of a , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: death-watch in the wall at the bed's head made Tom shudder—it meant that , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: somebody's days were numbered. Then the howl of a far-off dog rose on the night , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: air, and was answered by a fainter howl from a remoter distance. Tom was in an , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: agony. At last he was satisfied that time had ceased and eternity begun; he began , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: to doze, in spite of himself; the clock chimed eleven, but he did not hear it. And , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: then there came, mingling with his half-formed dreams, a most melancholy , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: caterwauling. The raising of a neighboring window disturbed him. A cry of "Scat! , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: you devil!" and the crash of an empty bottle against the back of his aunt's , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: woodshed brought him wide awake, and a single minute later he was dressed and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: out of the window and creeping along the roof of the "ell" on all fours. He , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "meow'd" with caution once or twice, as he went; then jumped to the roof of the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: woodshed and thence to the ground. Huckleberry Finn was there, with his dead , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: cat. The boys moved off and disappeared in the gloom. At the end of half an hour , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: they were wading through the tall grass of the graveyard. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: It was a graveyard of the old-fashioned Western kind. It was on a hill, about a , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: mile and a half from the village. It had a crazy board fence around it, which , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: leaned inward in places, and outward the rest of the time, but stood upright , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: nowhere. Grass and weeds grew rank over the whole cemetery. All the old graves , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: were sunken in, there was not a tombstone on the place; round-topped, worm-, Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: eaten boards staggered over the graves, leaning for support and finding none. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Sacred to the memory of" So-and-So had been painted on them once, but it could , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: no longer have been read, on the most of them, now, even if there had been light. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: A faint wind moaned through the trees, and Tom feared it might be the spirits , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: of the dead, complaining at being disturbed. The boys talked little, and only under , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: their breath, for the time and the place and the pervading solemnity and silence , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: oppressed their spirits. They found the sharp new heap they were seeking, and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: ensconced themselves within the protection of three great elms that grew in a , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: bunch within a few feet of the grave. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Then they waited in silence for what seemed a long time. The hooting of a , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: distant owl was all the sound that troubled the dead stillness. Tom's reflections , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: grew oppressive. He must force some talk. So he said in a whisper: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Hucky, do you believe the dead people like it for us to be here?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Huckleberry whispered: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I wisht I knowed. It's awful solemn like, AIN'T it?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I bet it is." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: There was a considerable pause, while the boys canvassed this matter inwardly. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Then Tom whispered: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Say, Hucky—do you reckon Hoss Williams hears us talking?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "O' course he does. Least his sperrit does." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Tom, after a pause: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I wish I'd said Mister Williams. But I never meant any harm. Everybody calls , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: him Hoss." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "A body can't be too partic'lar how they talk 'bout these-yer dead people, Tom." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: This was a damper, and conversation died again. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Presently Tom seized his comrade's arm and said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Sh!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "What is it, Tom?" And the two clung together with beating hearts. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Sh! There 'tis again! Didn't you hear it?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I—" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "There! Now you hear it." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Lord, Tom, they're coming! They're coming, sure. What'll we do?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I dono. Think they'll see us?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Oh, Tom, they can see in the dark, same as cats. I wisht I hadn't come." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Oh, don't be afeard. I don't believe they'll bother us. We ain't doing any harm. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: If we keep perfectly still, maybe they won't notice us at all." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I'll try to, Tom, but, Lord, I'm all of a shiver." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Listen!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: The boys bent their heads together and scarcely breathed. A muffled sound of , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: voices floated up from the far end of the graveyard. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Look! See there!" whispered Tom. "What is it?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "It's devil-fire. Oh, Tom, this is awful." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Some vague figures approached through the gloom, swinging an old-fashioned , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: tin lantern that freckled the ground with innumerable little spangles of light. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Presently Huckleberry whispered with a shudder: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "It's the devils sure enough. Three of 'em! Lordy, Tom, we're goners! Can you , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: pray?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I'll try, but don't you be afeard. They ain't going to hurt us. 'Now I lay me down , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: to sleep, I—'" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Sh!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "What is it, Huck?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "They're HUMANS! One of 'em is, anyway. One of 'em's old Muff Potter's voice." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "No—'tain't so, is it?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I bet I know it. Don't you stir nor budge. He ain't sharp enough to notice us. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Drunk, the same as usual, likely—blamed old rip!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "All right, I'll keep still. Now they're stuck. Can't find it. Here they come again. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Now they're hot. Cold again. Hot again. Red hot! They're p'inted right, this time. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Say, Huck, I know another o' them voices; it's Injun Joe." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "That's so—that murderin' half-breed! I'd druther they was devils a dern sight. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: What kin they be up to?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: The whisper died wholly out, now, for the three men had reached the grave and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: stood within a few feet of the boys' hiding-place. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Here it is," said the third voice; and the owner of it held the lantern up and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: revealed the face of young Doctor Robinson. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Potter and Injun Joe were carrying a handbarrow with a rope and a couple of , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: shovels on it. They cast down their load and began to open the grave. The doctor , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: put the lantern at the head of the grave and came and sat down with his back , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: against one of the elm trees. He was so close the boys could have touched him. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Hurry, men!" he said, in a low voice; "the moon might come out at any , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: moment." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: They growled a response and went on digging. For some time there was no , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: noise but the grating sound of the spades discharging their freight of mould and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: gravel. It was very monotonous. Finally a spade struck upon the coffin with a dull , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: woody accent, and within another minute or two the men had hoisted it out on , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the ground. They pried off the lid with their shovels, got out the body and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: dumped it rudely on the ground. The moon drifted from behind the clouds and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: exposed the pallid face. The barrow was got ready and the corpse placed on it, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: covered with a blanket, and bound to its place with the rope. Potter took out a , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: large spring-knife and cut off the dangling end of the rope and then said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Now the cussed thing's ready, Sawbones, and you'll just out with another five, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: or here she stays." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "That's the talk!" said Injun Joe. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Look here, what does this mean?" said the doctor. "You required your pay in , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: advance, and I've paid you." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Yes, and you done more than that," said Injun Joe, approaching the doctor, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: who was now standing. "Five years ago you drove me away from your father's , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: kitchen one night, when I come to ask for something to eat, and you said I warn't , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: there for any good; and when I swore I'd get even with you if it took a hundred , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: years, your father had me jailed for a vagrant. Did you think I'd forget? The Injun , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: blood ain't in me for nothing. And now I've GOT you, and you got to SETTLE, you , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: know!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: He was threatening the doctor, with his fist in his face, by this time. The doctor , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: struck out suddenly and stretched the ruffian on the ground. Potter dropped his , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: knife, and exclaimed: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Here, now, don't you hit my pard!" and the next moment he had grappled with , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the doctor and the two were struggling with might and main, trampling the grass , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and tearing the ground with their heels. Injun Joe sprang to his feet, his eyes , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: flaming with passion, snatched up Potter's knife, and went creeping, catlike and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: stooping, round and round about the combatants, seeking an opportunity. All at , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: once the doctor flung himself free, seized the heavy headboard of Williams' grave , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and felled Potter to the earth with it—and in the same instant the half-breed saw , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: his chance and drove the knife to the hilt in the young man's breast. He reeled , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and fell partly upon Potter, flooding him with his blood, and in the same moment , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the clouds blotted out the dreadful spectacle and the two frightened boys went , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: speeding away in the dark. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Presently, when the moon emerged again, Injun Joe was standing over the two , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: forms, contemplating them. The doctor murmured inarticulately, gave a long gasp , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: or two and was still. The half-breed muttered: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "THAT score is settled—damn you." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Then he robbed the body. After which he put the fatal knife in Potter's open , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: right hand, and sat down on the dismantled coffin. Three—four—five minutes , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: passed, and then Potter began to stir and moan. His hand closed upon the knife; , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: he raised it, glanced at it, and let it fall, with a shudder. Then he sat up, pushing , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the body from him, and gazed at it, and then around him, confusedly. His eyes , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: met Joe's. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Lord, how is this, Joe?" he said. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "It's a dirty business," said Joe, without moving. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "What did you do it for?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I! I never done it!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Look here! That kind of talk won't wash." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Potter trembled and grew white. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I thought I'd got sober. I'd no business to drink to-night. But it's in my head , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: yet—worse'n when we started here. I'm all in a muddle; can't recollect anything of , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: it, hardly. Tell me, Joe—HONEST, now, old feller—did I do it? Joe, I never meant , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: to—'pon my soul and honor, I never meant to, Joe. Tell me how it was, Joe. Oh, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: it's awful—and him so young and promising." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Why, you two was scuffling, and he fetched you one with the headboard and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: you fell flat; and then up you come, all reeling and staggering like, and snatched , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the knife and jammed it into him, just as he fetched you another awful clip—and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: here you've laid, as dead as a wedge til now." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Oh, I didn't know what I was a-doing. I wish I may die this minute if I did. It , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: was all on account of the whiskey and the excitement, I reckon. I never used a , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: weepon in my life before, Joe. I've fought, but never with weepons. They'll all say , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: that. Joe, don't tell! Say you won't tell, Joe—that's a good feller. I always liked , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: you, Joe, and stood up for you, too. Don't you remember? You WON'T tell, WILL , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: you, Joe?" And the poor creature dropped on his knees before the stolid murderer, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and clasped his appealing hands. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "No, you've always been fair and square with me, Muff Potter, and I won't go , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: back on you. There, now, that's as fair as a man can say." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Oh, Joe, you're an angel. I'll bless you for this the longest day I live." And , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Potter began to cry. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Come, now, that's enough of that. This ain't any time for blubbering. You be , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: off yonder way and I'll go this. Move, now, and don't leave any tracks behind , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: you." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Potter started on a trot that quickly increased to a run. The half-breed stood , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: looking after him. He muttered: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "If he's as much stunned with the lick and fuddled with the rum as he had the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: look of being, he won't think of the knife till he's gone so far he'll be afraid to , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: come back after it to such a place by himself—chicken-heart!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Two or three minutes later the murdered man, the blanketed corpse, the lidless , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: THE two boys flew on and on, toward the village, speechless with horror. They , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: glanced backward over their shoulders from time to time, apprehensively, as if , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: they feared they might be followed. Every stump that started up in their path , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: seemed a man and an enemy, and made them catch their breath; and as they sped , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: by some outlying cottages that lay near the village, the barking of the aroused , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: watch-dogs seemed to give wings to their feet. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "If we can only get to the old tannery before we break down!" whispered Tom, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: in short catches between breaths. "I can't stand it much longer." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Huckleberry's hard pantings were his only reply, and the boys fixed their eyes , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: on the goal of their hopes and bent to their work to win it. They gained steadily , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: on it, and at last, breast to breast, they burst through the open door and fell , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: grateful and exhausted in the sheltering shadows beyond. By and by their pulses , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: slowed down, and Tom whispered: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Huckleberry, what do you reckon'll come of this?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "If Doctor Robinson dies, I reckon hanging'll come of it." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Do you though?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Why, I KNOW it, Tom." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: "Who'll tell? We?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "What are you talking about? S'pose something happened and Injun Joe DIDN'T , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: "That's just what I was thinking to myself, Huck." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "If anybody tells, let Muff Potter do it, if he's fool enough. He's generally drunk , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: Tom said nothing—went on thinking. Presently he whispered: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Huck, Muff Potter don't know it. How can he tell?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "What's the reason he don't know it?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Because he'd just got that whack when Injun Joe done it. D'you reckon he could , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: "By hokey, that's so, Tom!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "And besides, look-a-here—maybe that whack done for HIM!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "No, 'taint likely, Tom. He had liquor in him; I could see that; and besides, he , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: When they had got to within five steps of the snorer, Tom stepped on a stick, and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: exchange a parting word. That long, lugubrious howl rose on the night air again! , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: They turned and saw the strange dog standing within a few feet of where Potter , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: "Say, Tom—they say a stray dog come howling around Johnny Miller's house, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: but there were averted eyes; there was a silence and an air of solemnity that , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: no use for her to try any more. This was worse than a thousand whippings, and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Tom's heart was sorer now than his body. He cried, he pleaded for forgiveness, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: Somebody pinched his arm. He turned, and his eyes met Huckleberry's. Then both , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: "Who's accused you?" shouted a voice. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: This shot seemed to carry home. Potter lifted his face and looked around him , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: "Oh, Injun Joe, you promised me you'd never—" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: half the time." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Tom blanched and dropped his eyes. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "It's a bad sign," said Aunt Polly, gravely. "What you got on your mind, Tom?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Nothing. Nothing 't I know of." But the boy's hand shook so that he spilled his , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: coffee. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "And you do talk such stuff," Sid said. "Last night you said, 'It's blood, it's , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: blood, that's what it is!' You said that over and over. And you said, 'Don't torment , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: me so—I'll tell!' Tell WHAT? What is it you'll tell?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Everything was swimming before Tom. There is no telling what might have , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: happened, now, but luckily the concern passed out of Aunt Polly's face and she , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: came to Tom's relief without knowing it. She said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Sho! It's that dreadful murder. I dream about it most every night myself. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Sometimes I dream it's me that done it." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Mary said she had been affected much the same way. Sid seemed satisfied. Tom , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: got out of the presence as quick as he plausibly could, and after that he , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: complained of toothache for a week, and tied up his jaws every night. He never , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: knew that Sid lay nightly watching, and frequently slipped the bandage free and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: then leaned on his elbow listening a good while at a time, and afterward slipped , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the bandage back to its place again. Tom's distress of mind wore off gradually and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the toothache grew irksome and was discarded. If Sid really managed to make , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: anything out of Tom's disjointed mutterings, he kept it to himself. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: It seemed to Tom that his schoolmates never would get done holding inquests , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: on dead cats, and thus keeping his trouble present to his mind. Sid noticed that , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Tom never was coroner at one of these inquiries, though it had been his habit to , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: take the lead in all new enterprises; he noticed, too, that Tom never acted as a , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: witness—and that was strange; and Sid did not overlook the fact that Tom even , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: showed a marked aversion to these inquests, and always avoided them when he , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: could. Sid marvelled, but said nothing. However, even inquests went out of vogue , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: at last, and ceased to torture Tom's conscience. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Every day or two, during this time of sorrow, Tom watched his opportunity and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: went to the little grated jail-window and smuggled such small comforts through to , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the "murderer" as he could get hold of. The jail was a trifling little brick den that , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: stood in a marsh at the edge of the village, and no guards were afforded for it; , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: indeed, it was seldom occupied. These offerings greatly helped to ease Tom's , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: conscience. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: The villagers had a strong desire to tar-and-feather Injun Joe and ride him on a , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: rail, for body-snatching, but so formidable was his character that nobody could be , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: found who was willing to take the lead in the matter, so it was dropped. He had , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: been careful to begin both of his inquest-statements with the fight, without , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: confessing the grave-robbery that preceded it; therefore it was deemed wisest not , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: CHAPTER XII , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Bold, Size: 18.0
Text: ONE of the reasons why Tom's mind had drifted away from its secret troubles , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: was, that it had found a new and weighty matter to interest itself about. Becky , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Thatcher had stopped coming to school. Tom had struggled with his pride a few , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: days, and tried to "whistle her down the wind," but failed. He began to find , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: himself hanging around her father's house, nights, and feeling very miserable. She , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: was ill. What if she should die! There was distraction in the thought. He no longer , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: took an interest in war, nor even in piracy. The charm of life was gone; there was , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: nothing but dreariness left. He put his hoop away, and his bat; there was no joy , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: in them any more. His aunt was concerned. She began to try all manner of , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: remedies on him. She was one of those people who are infatuated with patent , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: medicines and all new-fangled methods of producing health or mending it. She , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: was an inveterate experimenter in these things. When something fresh in this line , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: came out she was in a fever, right away, to try it; not on herself, for she was , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: never ailing, but on anybody else that came handy. She was a subscriber for all , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the "Health" periodicals and phrenological frauds; and the solemn ignorance they , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: were inflated with was breath to her nostrils. All the "rot" they contained about , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: ventilation, and how to go to bed, and how to get up, and what to eat, and what , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: to drink, and how much exercise to take, and what frame of mind to keep one's , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: self in, and what sort of clothing to wear, was all gospel to her, and she never , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: observed that her health-journals of the current month customarily upset , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: everything they had recommended the month before. She was as simple-hearted , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and honest as the day was long, and so she was an easy victim. She gathered , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: together her quack periodicals and her quack medicines, and thus armed with , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: death, went about on her pale horse, metaphorically speaking, with "hell following , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: after." But she never suspected that she was not an angel of healing and the balm , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: of Gilead in disguise, to the suffering neighbors. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: The water treatment was new, now, and Tom's low condition was a windfall to , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: her. She had him out at daylight every morning, stood him up in the wood-shed , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and drowned him with a deluge of cold water; then she scrubbed him down with , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: a towel like a file, and so brought him to; then she rolled him up in a wet sheet , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and put him away under blankets till she sweated his soul clean and "the yellow , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: stains of it came through his pores"—as Tom said. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Yet notwithstanding all this, the boy grew more and more melancholy and pale , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and dejected. She added hot baths, sitz baths, shower baths, and plunges. The , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: boy remained as dismal as a hearse. She began to assist the water with a slim , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: oatmeal diet and blister-plasters. She calculated his capacity as she would a jug's, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and filled him up every day with quack cure-alls. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Tom had become indifferent to persecution by this time. This phase filled the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: old lady's heart with consternation. This indifference must be broken up at any , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: cost. Now she heard of Pain-killer for the first time. She ordered a lot at once. She , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: tasted it and was filled with gratitude. It was simply fire in a liquid form. She , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: dropped the water treatment and everything else, and pinned her faith to Pain-, Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: killer. She gave Tom a teaspoonful and watched with the deepest anxiety for the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: result. Her troubles were instantly at rest, her soul at peace again; for the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "indifference" was broken up. The boy could not have shown a wilder, heartier , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: interest, if she had built a fire under him. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Tom felt that it was time to wake up; this sort of life might be romantic enough, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: in his blighted condition, but it was getting to have too little sentiment and too , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: much distracting variety about it. So he thought over various plans for relief, and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: finally hit upon that of professing to be fond of Pain-killer. He asked for it so , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: often that he became a nuisance, and his aunt ended by telling him to help , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: himself and quit bothering her. If it had been Sid, she would have had no , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: misgivings to alloy her delight; but since it was Tom, she watched the bottle , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: clandestinely. She found that the medicine did really diminish, but it did not , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: occur to her that the boy was mending the health of a crack in the sitting-room , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: floor with it. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: One day Tom was in the act of dosing the crack when his aunt's yellow cat , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: came along, purring, eyeing the teaspoon avariciously, and begging for a taste. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Tom said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Don't ask for it unless you want it, Peter." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: But Peter signified that he did want it. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "You better make sure." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Peter was sure. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Now you've asked for it, and I'll give it to you, because there ain't anything , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: mean about me; but if you find you don't like it, you mustn't blame anybody but , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: your own self." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Peter was agreeable. So Tom pried his mouth open and poured down the Pain-, Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: killer. Peter sprang a couple of yards in the air, and then delivered a war-whoop , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and set off round and round the room, banging against furniture, upsetting flower-, Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: pots, and making general havoc. Next he rose on his hind feet and pranced , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: around, in a frenzy of enjoyment, with his head over his shoulder and his voice , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: proclaiming his unappeasable happiness. Then he went tearing around the house , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: again spreading chaos and destruction in his path. Aunt Polly entered in time to , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: see him throw a few double summersets, deliver a final mighty hurrah, and sail , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: through the open window, carrying the rest of the flower-pots with him. The old , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: lady stood petrified with astonishment, peering over her glasses; Tom lay on the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: floor expiring with laughter. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Tom, what on earth ails that cat?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I don't know, aunt," gasped the boy. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Why, I never see anything like it. What did make him act so?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Deed I don't know, Aunt Polly; cats always act so when they're having a good , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: time." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "They do, do they?" There was something in the tone that made Tom , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: apprehensive. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Yes'm. That is, I believe they do." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "You DO?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Yes'm." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: The old lady was bending down, Tom watching, with interest emphasized by , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: anxiety. Too late he divined her "drift." The handle of the telltale tea-spoon was , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: visible under the bed-valance. Aunt Polly took it, held it up. Tom winced, and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: dropped his eyes. Aunt Polly raised him by the usual handle—his ear—and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: cracked his head soundly with her thimble. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Now, sir, what did you want to treat that poor dumb beast so, for?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I done it out of pity for him—because he hadn't any aunt." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Hadn't any aunt!—you numskull. What has that got to do with it?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Heaps. Because if he'd had one she'd a burnt him out herself! She'd a roasted , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: his bowels out of him 'thout any more feeling than if he was a human!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Aunt Polly felt a sudden pang of remorse. This was putting the thing in a new , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: light; what was cruelty to a cat MIGHT be cruelty to a boy, too. She began to , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: soften; she felt sorry. Her eyes watered a little, and she put her hand on Tom's , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: head and said gently: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I was meaning for the best, Tom. And, Tom, it DID do you good." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Tom looked up in her face with just a perceptible twinkle peeping through his , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: gravity. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I know you was meaning for the best, aunty, and so was I with Peter. It done , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: HIM good, too. I never see him get around so since—" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Oh, go 'long with you, Tom, before you aggravate me again. And you try and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: see if you can't be a good boy, for once, and you needn't take any more medicine." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Tom reached school ahead of time. It was noticed that this strange thing had , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: been occurring every day latterly. And now, as usual of late, he hung about the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: gate of the schoolyard instead of playing with his comrades. He was sick, he said, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and he looked it. He tried to seem to be looking everywhere but whither he really , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: was looking—down the road. Presently Jeff Thatcher hove in sight, and Tom's face , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: lighted; he gazed a moment, and then turned sorrowfully away. When Jeff arrived, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Tom accosted him; and "led up" warily to opportunities for remark about Becky, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: but the giddy lad never could see the bait. Tom watched and watched, hoping , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: whenever a frisking frock came in sight, and hating the owner of it as soon as he , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: saw she was not the right one. At last frocks ceased to appear, and he dropped , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: hopelessly into the dumps; he entered the empty schoolhouse and sat down to , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: suffer. Then one more frock passed in at the gate, and Tom's heart gave a great , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: bound. The next instant he was out, and "going on" like an Indian; yelling, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: laughing, chasing boys, jumping over the fence at risk of life and limb, throwing , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: handsprings, standing on his head—doing all the heroic things he could conceive , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: of, and keeping a furtive eye out, all the while, to see if Becky Thatcher was , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: noticing. But she seemed to be unconscious of it all; she never looked. Could it be , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: possible that she was not aware that he was there? He carried his exploits to her , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: immediate vicinity; came war-whooping around, snatched a boy's cap, hurled it to , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the roof of the schoolhouse, broke through a group of boys, tumbling them in , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: every direction, and fell sprawling, himself, under Becky's nose, almost upsetting , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: her—and she turned, with her nose in the air, and he heard her say: "Mf! some , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: people think they're mighty smart—always showing off!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: By this time he was far down Meadow Lane, and the bell for school to "take up" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: tinkled faintly upon his ear. He sobbed, now, to think he should never, never hear , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: that old familiar sound any more—it was very hard, but it was forced on him; , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: them. Then the sobs came thick and fast. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Just at this point he met his soul's sworn comrade, Joe Harper—hard-eyed, and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: with evidently a great and dismal purpose in his heart. Plainly here were "two , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: souls with but a single thought." Tom, wiping his eyes with his sleeve, began to , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: blubber out something about a resolution to escape from hard usage and lack of , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: sympathy at home by roaming abroad into the great world never to return; and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: ended by hoping that Joe would not forget him. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: But it transpired that this was a request which Joe had just been going to make , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: of Tom, and had come to hunt him up for that purpose. His mother had whipped , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: never regret having driven her poor boy out into the unfeeling world to suffer and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: die. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: As the two boys walked sorrowing along, they made a new compact to stand by , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: each other and be brothers and never separate till death relieved them of their , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: troubles. Then they began to lay their plans. Joe was for being a hermit, and living , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: on crusts in a remote cave, and dying, some time, of cold and want and grief; but , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: after listening to Tom, he conceded that there were some conspicuous advantages , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: about a life of crime, and so he consented to be a pirate. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Three miles below St. Petersburg, at a point where the Mississippi River was a , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: trifle over a mile wide, there was a long, narrow, wooded island, with a shallow , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: bar at the head of it, and this offered well as a rendezvous. It was not inhabited; , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: it lay far over toward the further shore, abreast a dense and almost wholly , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: unpeopled forest. So Jackson's Island was chosen. Who were to be the subjects of , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: their piracies was a matter that did not occur to them. Then they hunted up , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Huckleberry Finn, and he joined them promptly, for all careers were one to him; , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: he was indifferent. They presently separated to meet at a lonely spot on the river-, Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: bank two miles above the village at the favorite hour—which was midnight. There , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: was a small log raft there which they meant to capture. Each would bring hooks , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and lines, and such provision as he could steal in the most dark and mysterious , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: way—as became outlaws. And before the afternoon was done, they had all , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: managed to enjoy the sweet glory of spreading the fact that pretty soon the town , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: would "hear something." All who got this vague hint were cautioned to "be mum , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and wait." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: About midnight Tom arrived with a boiled ham and a few trifles, and stopped in , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: a dense undergrowth on a small bluff overlooking the meeting-place. It was , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: starlight, and very still. The mighty river lay like an ocean at rest. Tom listened a , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: moment, but no sound disturbed the quiet. Then he gave a low, distinct whistle. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: It was answered from under the bluff. Tom whistled twice more; these signals , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: were answered in the same way. Then a guarded voice said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Who goes there?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Tom Sawyer, the Black Avenger of the Spanish Main. Name your names." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Huck Finn the Red-Handed, and Joe Harper the Terror of the Seas." Tom had , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: furnished these titles, from his favorite literature. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "'Tis well. Give the countersign." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Two hoarse whispers delivered the same awful word simultaneously to the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: brooding night: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "BLOOD!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Then Tom tumbled his ham over the bluff and let himself down after it, tearing , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: both skin and clothes to some extent in the effort. There was an easy, comfortable , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: path along the shore under the bluff, but it lacked the advantages of difficulty and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: danger so valued by a pirate. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: The Terror of the Seas had brought a side of bacon, and had about worn himself , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: out with getting it there. Finn the Red-Handed had stolen a skillet and a quantity , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: of half-cured leaf tobacco, and had also brought a few corn-cobs to make pipes , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: with. But none of the pirates smoked or "chewed" but himself. The Black Avenger , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: of the Spanish Main said it would never do to start without some fire. That was a , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: wise thought; matches were hardly known there in that day. They saw a fire , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: smouldering upon a great raft a hundred yards above, and they went stealthily , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: thither and helped themselves to a chunk. They made an imposing adventure of it, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: saying, "Hist!" every now and then, and suddenly halting with finger on lip; , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: moving with hands on imaginary dagger-hilts; and giving orders in dismal , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: whispers that if "the foe" stirred, to "let him have it to the hilt," because "dead , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: men tell no tales." They knew well enough that the raftsmen were all down at the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: village laying in stores or having a spree, but still that was no excuse for their , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: conducting this thing in an unpiratical way. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: They shoved off, presently, Tom in command, Huck at the after oar and Joe at , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the forward. Tom stood amidships, gloomy-browed, and with folded arms, and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: gave his orders in a low, stern whisper: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Luff, and bring her to the wind!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Aye-aye, sir!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Steady, steady-y-y-y!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Steady it is, sir!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Let her go off a point!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Point it is, sir!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: As the boys steadily and monotonously drove the raft toward mid-stream it was , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: no doubt understood that these orders were given only for "style," and were not , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: intended to mean anything in particular. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "What sail's she carrying?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Courses, tops'ls, and flying-jib, sir." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Send the r'yals up! Lay out aloft, there, half a dozen of ye—foretopmaststuns'l! , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Lively, now!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Aye-aye, sir!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Shake out that maintogalans'l! Sheets and braces! NOW my hearties!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Aye-aye, sir!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Hellum-a-lee—hard a port! Stand by to meet her when she comes! Port, port! , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: NOW, men! With a will! Stead-y-y-y!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Steady it is, sir!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: The raft drew beyond the middle of the river; the boys pointed her head right, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and then lay on their oars. The river was not high, so there was not more than a , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: two or three mile current. Hardly a word was said during the next three-quarters , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: of an hour. Now the raft was passing before the distant town. Two or three , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: glimmering lights showed where it lay, peacefully sleeping, beyond the vague vast , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: sweep of star-gemmed water, unconscious of the tremendous event that was , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: happening. The Black Avenger stood still with folded arms, "looking his last" upon , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the scene of his former joys and his later sufferings, and wishing "she" could see , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: him now, abroad on the wild sea, facing peril and death with dauntless heart, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: going to his doom with a grim smile on his lips. It was but a small strain on his , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: imagination to remove Jackson's Island beyond eye-shot of the village, and so he , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "looked his last" with a broken and satisfied heart. The other pirates were looking , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: their last, too; and they all looked so long that they came near letting the current , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: drift them out of the range of the island. But they discovered the danger in time, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and made shift to avert it. About two o'clock in the morning the raft grounded on , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the bar two hundred yards above the head of the island, and they waded back and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: forth until they had landed their freight. Part of the little raft's belongings , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: consisted of an old sail, and this they spread over a nook in the bushes for a tent , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: to shelter their provisions; but they themselves would sleep in the open air in , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: good weather, as became outlaws. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: They built a fire against the side of a great log twenty or thirty steps within the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: sombre depths of the forest, and then cooked some bacon in the frying-pan for , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: supper, and used up half of the corn "pone" stock they had brought. It seemed , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: glorious sport to be feasting in that wild, free way in the virgin forest of an , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: unexplored and uninhabited island, far from the haunts of men, and they said , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: they never would return to civilization. The climbing fire lit up their faces and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: threw its ruddy glare upon the pillared tree-trunks of their forest temple, and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: upon the varnished foliage and festooning vines. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: When the last crisp slice of bacon was gone, and the last allowance of corn pone , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: devoured, the boys stretched themselves out on the grass, filled with contentment. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: They could have found a cooler place, but they would not deny themselves such a , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: "AIN'T it gay?" said Joe. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: "Say? Well, they'd just die to be here—hey, Hucky!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I reckon so," said Huckleberry; "anyways, I'm suited. I don't want nothing , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: better'n this. I don't ever get enough to eat, gen'ally—and here they can't come , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text:  , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "It's just the life for me," said Tom. "You don't have to get up, mornings, and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: you don't have to go to school, and wash, and all that blame foolishness. You see , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: a pirate don't have to do ANYTHING, Joe, when he's ashore, but a hermit HE has , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: that way." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Oh yes, that's so," said Joe, "but I hadn't thought much about it, you know. I'd , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: a good deal rather be a pirate, now that I've tried it." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "You see," said Tom, "people don't go much on hermits, nowadays, like they , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: used to in old times, but a pirate's always respected. And a hermit's got to sleep , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: on the hardest place he can find, and put sackcloth and ashes on his head, and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: stand out in the rain, and—" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "What does he put sackcloth and ashes on his head for?" inquired Huck. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I dono. But they've GOT to do it. Hermits always do. You'd have to do that if , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: you was a hermit." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Dern'd if I would," said Huck. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Well, what would you do?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I dono. But I wouldn't do that." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Why, Huck, you'd HAVE to. How'd you get around it?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Why, I just wouldn't stand it. I'd run away." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Run away! Well, you WOULD be a nice old slouch of a hermit. You'd be a , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: disgrace." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: The Red-Handed made no response, being better employed. He had finished , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: gouging out a cob, and now he fitted a weed stem to it, loaded it with tobacco, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and was pressing a coal to the charge and blowing a cloud of fragrant smoke—he , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: was in the full bloom of luxurious contentment. The other pirates envied him this , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: majestic vice, and secretly resolved to acquire it shortly. Presently Huck said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "What does pirates have to do?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Tom said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Oh, they have just a bully time—take ships and burn them, and get the money , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and bury it in awful places in their island where there's ghosts and things to , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: watch it, and kill everybody in the ships—make 'em walk a plank." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "And they carry the women to the island," said Joe; "they don't kill the women." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "No," assented Tom, "they don't kill the women—they're too noble. And the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: women's always beautiful, too. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "And don't they wear the bulliest clothes! Oh no! All gold and silver and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: di'monds," said Joe, with enthusiasm. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Who?" said Huck. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Why, the pirates." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Huck scanned his own clothing forlornly. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I reckon I ain't dressed fitten for a pirate," said he, with a regretful pathos in , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: his voice; "but I ain't got none but these." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: But the other boys told him the fine clothes would come fast enough, after they , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: should have begun their adventures. They made him understand that his poor rags , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: would do to begin with, though it was customary for wealthy pirates to start with , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: a proper wardrobe. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Gradually their talk died out and drowsiness began to steal upon the eyelids of , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the little waifs. The pipe dropped from the fingers of the Red-Handed, and he , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: slept the sleep of the conscience-free and the weary. The Terror of the Seas and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the Black Avenger of the Spanish Main had more difficulty in getting to sleep. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: They said their prayers inwardly, and lying down, since there was nobody there , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: with authority to make them kneel and recite aloud; in truth, they had a mind not , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: to say them at all, but they were afraid to proceed to such lengths as that, lest , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: they might call down a sudden and special thunderbolt from heaven. Then at once , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: they reached and hovered upon the imminent verge of sleep—but an intruder , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: came, now, that would not "down." It was conscience. They began to feel a vague , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: fear that they had been doing wrong to run away; and next they thought of the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: stolen meat, and then the real torture came. They tried to argue it away by , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: reminding conscience that they had purloined sweetmeats and apples scores of , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: times; but conscience was not to be appeased by such thin plausibilities; it , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: seemed to them, in the end, that there was no getting around the stubborn fact , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: that taking sweetmeats was only "hooking," while taking bacon and hams and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: such valuables was plain simple stealing—and there was a command against that , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: in the Bible. So they inwardly resolved that so long as they remained in the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: business, their piracies should not again be sullied with the crime of stealing. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Then conscience granted a truce, and these curiously inconsistent pirates fell , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: its own accord, he sat as still as a stone, with his hopes rising and falling, by , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: turns, as the creature still came toward him or seemed inclined to go elsewhere; , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and when at last it considered a painful moment with its curved body in the air , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and then came decisively down upon Tom's leg and began a journey over him, his , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: whole heart was glad—for that meant that he was going to have a new suit of , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: procession of ants appeared, from nowhere in particular, and went about their , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: labors; one struggled manfully by with a dead spider five times as big as itself in , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: its arms, and lugged it straight up a tree-trunk. A brown spotted lady-bug climbed , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the dizzy height of a grass blade, and Tom bent down close to it and said, "Lady-, Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: bug, lady-bug, fly away home, your house is on fire, your children's alone," and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: she took wing and went off to see about it—which did not surprise the boy, for he , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: knew of old that this insect was credulous about conflagrations, and he had , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: practised upon its simplicity more than once. A tumblebug came next, heaving , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: sturdily at its ball, and Tom touched the creature, to see it shut its legs against its , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: body and pretend to be dead. The birds were fairly rioting by this time. A catbird, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the Northern mocker, lit in a tree over Tom's head, and trilled out her imitations , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: of her neighbors in a rapture of enjoyment; then a shrill jay swept down, a flash , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: of blue flame, and stopped on a twig almost within the boy's reach, cocked his , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: head to one side and eyed the strangers with a consuming curiosity; a gray , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: in the shallow limpid water of the white sandbar. They felt no longing for the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: vagrant current or a slight rise in the river had carried off their raft, but this only , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text:  , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: They came back to camp wonderfully refreshed, glad-hearted, and ravenous; , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and they soon had the camp-fire blazing up again. Huck found a spring of clear , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: cold water close by, and the boys made cups of broad oak or hickory leaves, and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: felt that water, sweetened with such a wildwood charm as that, would be a good , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: enough substitute for coffee. While Joe was slicing bacon for breakfast, Tom and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Huck asked him to hold on a minute; they stepped to a promising nook in the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: river-bank and threw in their lines; almost immediately they had reward. Joe had , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: not had time to get impatient before they were back again with some handsome , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: bass, a couple of sun-perch and a small catfish—provisions enough for quite a , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: family. They fried the fish with the bacon, and were astonished; for no fish had , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: ever seemed so delicious before. They did not know that the quicker a fresh-water , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: fish is on the fire after he is caught the better he is; and they reflected little upon , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: what a sauce open-air sleeping, open-air exercise, bathing, and a large ingredient , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: of hunger make, too. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: They lay around in the shade, after breakfast, while Huck had a smoke, and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: then went off through the woods on an exploring expedition. They tramped gayly , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: along, over decaying logs, through tangled underbrush, among solemn monarchs , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: of the forest, hung from their crowns to the ground with a drooping regalia of , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: grape-vines. Now and then they came upon snug nooks carpeted with grass and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: jeweled with flowers. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: They found plenty of things to be delighted with, but nothing to be astonished , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: at. They discovered that the island was about three miles long and a quarter of a , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: mile wide, and that the shore it lay closest to was only separated from it by a , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: narrow channel hardly two hundred yards wide. They took a swim about every , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: hour, so it was close upon the middle of the afternoon when they got back to , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: camp. They were too hungry to stop to fish, but they fared sumptuously upon , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: cold ham, and then threw themselves down in the shade to talk. But the talk soon , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: began to drag, and then died. The stillness, the solemnity that brooded in the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: woods, and the sense of loneliness, began to tell upon the spirits of the boys. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: They fell to thinking. A sort of undefined longing crept upon them. This took dim , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: shape, presently—it was budding homesickness. Even Finn the Red-Handed was , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: dreaming of his doorsteps and empty hogsheads. But they were all ashamed of , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: their weakness, and none was brave enough to speak his thought. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: For some time, now, the boys had been dully conscious of a peculiar sound in , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the distance, just as one sometimes is of the ticking of a clock which he takes no , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: distinct note of. But now this mysterious sound became more pronounced, and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: forced a recognition. The boys started, glanced at each other, and then each , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: assumed a listening attitude. There was a long silence, profound and unbroken; , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: then a deep, sullen boom came floating down out of the distance. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "What is it!" exclaimed Joe, under his breath. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I wonder," said Tom in a whisper. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "'Tain't thunder," said Huckleberry, in an awed tone, "becuz thunder—" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Hark!" said Tom. "Listen—don't talk." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: They waited a time that seemed an age, and then the same muffled boom , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: troubled the solemn hush. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Let's go and see." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: They sprang to their feet and hurried to the shore toward the town. They parted , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the bushes on the bank and peered out over the water. The little steam ferry-boat , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: was about a mile below the village, drifting with the current. Her broad deck , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: seemed crowded with people. There were a great many skiffs rowing about or , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: floating with the stream in the neighborhood of the ferryboat, but the boys could , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: not determine what the men in them were doing. Presently a great jet of white , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: smoke burst from the ferryboat's side, and as it expanded and rose in a lazy cloud, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: that same dull throb of sound was borne to the listeners again. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I know now!" exclaimed Tom; "somebody's drownded!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "That's it!" said Huck; "they done that last summer, when Bill Turner got , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: drownded; they shoot a cannon over the water, and that makes him come up to , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the top. Yes, and they take loaves of bread and put quicksilver in 'em and set 'em , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: afloat, and wherever there's anybody that's drownded, they'll float right there and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: stop." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Yes, I've heard about that," said Joe. "I wonder what makes the bread do that." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Oh, it ain't the bread, so much," said Tom; "I reckon it's mostly what they SAY , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: over it before they start it out." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "But they don't say anything over it," said Huck. "I've seen 'em and they don't." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Well, that's funny," said Tom. "But maybe they say it to themselves. Of , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: COURSE they do. Anybody might know that." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: The other boys agreed that there was reason in what Tom said, because an , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: ignorant lump of bread, uninstructed by an incantation, could not be expected to , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: act very intelligently when set upon an errand of such gravity. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "By jings, I wish I was over there, now," said Joe. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I do too" said Huck "I'd give heaps to know who it is." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: The boys still listened and watched. Presently a revealing thought flashed , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: through Tom's mind, and he exclaimed: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Boys, I know who's drownded—it's us!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: They felt like heroes in an instant. Here was a gorgeous triumph; they were , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: missed; they were mourned; hearts were breaking on their account; tears were , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: being shed; accusing memories of unkindness to these poor lost lads were rising , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: up, and unavailing regrets and remorse were being indulged; and best of all, the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: departed were the talk of the whole town, and the envy of all the boys, as far as , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: this dazzling notoriety was concerned. This was fine. It was worth while to be a , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: pirate, after all. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: As twilight drew on, the ferryboat went back to her accustomed business and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the skiffs disappeared. The pirates returned to camp. They were jubilant with , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: vanity over their new grandeur and the illustrious trouble they were making. They , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: caught fish, cooked supper and ate it, and then fell to guessing at what the village , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: was thinking and saying about them; and the pictures they drew of the public , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: distress on their account were gratifying to look upon—from their point of view. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: But when the shadows of night closed them in, they gradually ceased to talk, and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: sat gazing into the fire, with their minds evidently wandering elsewhere. The , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: excitement was gone, now, and Tom and Joe could not keep back thoughts of , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: certain persons at home who were not enjoying this fine frolic as much as they , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: were. Misgivings came; they grew troubled and unhappy; a sigh or two escaped, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: unawares. By and by Joe timidly ventured upon a roundabout "feeler" as to how , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the others might look upon a return to civilization—not right now, but— , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Tom withered him with derision! Huck, being uncommitted as yet, joined in , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: with Tom, and the waverer quickly "explained," and was glad to get out of the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: scrape with as little taint of chicken-hearted home-sickness clinging to his , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: garments as he could. Mutiny was effectually laid to rest for the moment. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: As the night deepened, Huck began to nod, and presently to snore. Joe followed , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: next. Tom lay upon his elbow motionless, for some time, watching the two , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: intently. At last he got up cautiously, on his knees, and went searching among the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: grass and the flickering reflections flung by the campfire. He picked up and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: inspected several large semi-cylinders of the thin white bark of a sycamore, and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: finally chose two which seemed to suit him. Then he knelt by the fire and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: painfully wrote something upon each of these with his "red keel"; one he rolled up , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and put in his jacket pocket, and the other he put in Joe's hat and removed it to a , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: little distance from the owner. And he also put into the hat certain schoolboy , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: treasures of almost inestimable value—among them a lump of chalk, an India-, Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: rubber ball, three fishhooks, and one of that kind of marbles known as a "sure , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: 'nough crystal." Then he tiptoed his way cautiously among the trees till he felt , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: that he was out of hearing, and straightway broke into a keen run in the direction , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: of the sandbar. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: CHAPTER XV , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Bold, Size: 18.0
Text: A FEW minutes later Tom was in the shoal water of the bar, wading toward the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Illinois shore. Before the depth reached his middle he was halfway over; the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: current would permit no more wading, now, so he struck out confidently to swim , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the remaining hundred yards. He swam quartering upstream, but still was swept , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: downward rather faster than he had expected. However, he reached the shore , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: finally, and drifted along till he found a low place and drew himself out. He put , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: his hand on his jacket pocket, found his piece of bark safe, and then struck , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: through the woods, following the shore, with streaming garments. Shortly before , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: ten o'clock he came out into an open place opposite the village, and saw the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: ferryboat lying in the shadow of the trees and the high bank. Everything was quiet , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: under the blinking stars. He crept down the bank, watching with all his eyes, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: slipped into the water, swam three or four strokes and climbed into the skiff that , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: did "yawl" duty at the boat's stern. He laid himself down under the thwarts and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: waited, panting. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Presently the cracked bell tapped and a voice gave the order to "cast off." A , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: minute or two later the skiff's head was standing high up, against the boat's swell, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and the voyage was begun. Tom felt happy in his success, for he knew it was the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: boat's last trip for the night. At the end of a long twelve or fifteen minutes the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: wheels stopped, and Tom slipped overboard and swam ashore in the dusk, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: landing fifty yards downstream, out of danger of possible stragglers. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: He flew along unfrequented alleys, and shortly found himself at his aunt's back , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: fence. He climbed over, approached the "ell," and looked in at the sitting-room , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: window, for a light was burning there. There sat Aunt Polly, Sid, Mary, and Joe , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Harper's mother, grouped together, talking. They were by the bed, and the bed , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: was between them and the door. Tom went to the door and began to softly lift the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: latch; then he pressed gently and the door yielded a crack; he continued pushing , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: cautiously, and quaking every time it creaked, till he judged he might squeeze , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: through on his knees; so he put his head through and began, warily. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "What makes the candle blow so?" said Aunt Polly. Tom hurried up. "Why, that , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: door's open, I believe. Why, of course it is. No end of strange things now. Go 'long , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and shut it, Sid." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Tom disappeared under the bed just in time. He lay and "breathed" himself for a , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: time, and then crept to where he could almost touch his aunt's foot. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "But as I was saying," said Aunt Polly, "he warn't BAD, so to say—only , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: mischEEvous. Only just giddy, and harum-scarum, you know. He warn't any more , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: responsible than a colt. HE never meant any harm, and he was the best-hearted , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: "It was just so with my Joe—always full of his devilment, and up to every kind , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: recollecting that I throwed it out myself because it was sour, and I never to see , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: him again in this world, never, never, never, poor abused boy!" And Mrs. Harper , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: sobbed as if her heart would break. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I hope Tom's better off where he is," said Sid, "but if he'd been better in some , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: "SID!" Tom felt the glare of the old lady's eye, though he could not see it. "Not a , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: firecracker right under my nose and I knocked him sprawling. Little did I know , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: then, how soon—Oh, if it was to do over again I'd hug him and bless him for it." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Yes, yes, yes, I know just how you feel, Mrs. Harper, I know just exactly how , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: of Pain-killer, and I did think the cretur would tear the house down. And God , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: forgive me, I cracked Tom's head with my thimble, poor boy, poor dead boy. But , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: reproach—" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: But this memory was too much for the old lady, and she broke entirely down. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Tom was snuffling, now, himself—and more in pity of himself than anybody else. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: He could hear Mary crying, and putting in a kindly word for him from time to , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: sufficiently touched by his aunt's grief to long to rush out from under the bed and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: strongly to his nature, too, but he resisted and lay still. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: He went on listening, and gathered by odds and ends that it was conjectured at , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: first that the boys had got drowned while taking a swim; then the small raft had , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: been missed; next, certain boys said the missing lads had promised that the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: village should "hear something" soon; the wise-heads had "put this and that , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: together" and decided that the lads had gone off on that raft and would turn up at , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the next town below, presently; but toward noon the raft had been found, lodged , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: against the Missouri shore some five or six miles below the village—and then hope , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: perished; they must be drowned, else hunger would have driven them home by , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: nightfall if not sooner. It was believed that the search for the bodies had been a , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: fruitless effort merely because the drowning must have occurred in mid-channel, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: since the boys, being good swimmers, would otherwise have escaped to shore. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: This was Wednesday night. If the bodies continued missing until Sunday, all hope , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: would be given over, and the funerals would be preached on that morning. Tom , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: shuddered. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Mrs. Harper gave a sobbing goodnight and turned to go. Then with a mutual , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: impulse the two bereaved women flung themselves into each other's arms and had , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: a good, consoling cry, and then parted. Aunt Polly was tender far beyond her , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: wont, in her goodnight to Sid and Mary. Sid snuffled a bit and Mary went off , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: crying with all her heart. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Aunt Polly knelt down and prayed for Tom so touchingly, so appealingly, and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: with such measureless love in her words and her old trembling voice, that he was , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: weltering in tears again, long before she was through. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: He had to keep still long after she went to bed, for she kept making broken-, Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: hearted ejaculations from time to time, tossing unrestfully, and turning over. But , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: at last she was still, only moaning a little in her sleep. Now the boy stole out, rose , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: gradually by the bedside, shaded the candle-light with his hand, and stood , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: regarding her. His heart was full of pity for her. He took out his sycamore scroll , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and placed it by the candle. But something occurred to him, and he lingered , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: considering. His face lighted with a happy solution of his thought; he put the bark , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: hastily in his pocket. Then he bent over and kissed the faded lips, and straightway , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: made his stealthy exit, latching the door behind him. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: He threaded his way back to the ferry landing, found nobody at large there, and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: walked boldly on board the boat, for he knew she was tenantless except that there , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: was a watchman, who always turned in and slept like a graven image. He untied , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the skiff at the stern, slipped into it, and was soon rowing cautiously upstream. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: When he had pulled a mile above the village, he started quartering across and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: bent himself stoutly to his work. He hit the landing on the other side neatly, for , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: this was a familiar bit of work to him. He was moved to capture the skiff, arguing , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: that it might be considered a ship and therefore legitimate prey for a pirate, but , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: he knew a thorough search would be made for it and that might end in , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: revelations. So he stepped ashore and entered the woods. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: He sat down and took a long rest, torturing himself meanwhile to keep awake, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and then started warily down the home-stretch. The night was far spent. It was , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: broad daylight before he found himself fairly abreast the island bar. He rested , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: again until the sun was well up and gilding the great river with its splendor, and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: then he plunged into the stream. A little later he paused, dripping, upon the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: threshold of the camp, and heard Joe say: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "No, Tom's true-blue, Huck, and he'll come back. He won't desert. He knows , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: that would be a disgrace to a pirate, and Tom's too proud for that sort of thing. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: He's up to something or other. Now I wonder what?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Well, the things is ours, anyway, ain't they?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Pretty near, but not yet, Huck. The writing says they are if he ain't back here , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: to breakfast." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Which he is!" exclaimed Tom, with fine dramatic effect, stepping grandly into , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: camp. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: A sumptuous breakfast of bacon and fish was shortly provided, and as the boys , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: set to work upon it, Tom recounted (and adorned) his adventures. They were a , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: vain and boastful company of heroes when the tale was done. Then Tom hid , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: himself away in a shady nook to sleep till noon, and the other pirates got ready to , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: fish and explore. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: CHAPTER XVI , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Bold, Size: 18.0
Text: AFTER dinner all the gang turned out to hunt for turtle eggs on the bar. They , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: went about poking sticks into the sand, and when they found a soft place they , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: went down on their knees and dug with their hands. Sometimes they would take , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: fifty or sixty eggs out of one hole. They were perfectly round white things a trifle , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: smaller than an English walnut. They had a famous fried-egg feast that night, and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: another on Friday morning. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: After breakfast they went whooping and prancing out on the bar, and chased , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: each other round and round, shedding clothes as they went, until they were , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: naked, and then continued the frolic far away up the shoal water of the bar, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: against the stiff current, which latter tripped their legs from under them from time , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: to time and greatly increased the fun. And now and then they stooped in a group , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and splashed water in each other's faces with their palms, gradually approaching , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: each other, with averted faces to avoid the strangling sprays, and finally gripping , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and struggling till the best man ducked his neighbor, and then they all went under , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: in a tangle of white legs and arms and came up blowing, sputtering, laughing, and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: gasping for breath at one and the same time. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: When they were well exhausted, they would run out and sprawl on the dry, hot , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: sand, and lie there and cover themselves up with it, and by and by break for the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: water again and go through the original performance once more. Finally it , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: occurred to them that their naked skin represented flesh-colored "tights" very , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: fairly; so they drew a ring in the sand and had a circus—with three clowns in it, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: for none would yield this proudest post to his neighbor. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Next they got their marbles and played "knucks" and "ringtaw" and "keeps" till , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: that amusement grew stale. Then Joe and Huck had another swim, but Tom would , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: not venture, because he found that in kicking off his trousers he had kicked his , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: string of rattlesnake rattles off his ankle, and he wondered how he had escaped , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: cramp so long without the protection of this mysterious charm. He did not , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: venture again until he had found it, and by that time the other boys were tired , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and ready to rest. They gradually wandered apart, dropped into the "dumps," and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: fell to gazing longingly across the wide river to where the village lay drowsing in , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the sun. Tom found himself writing "BECKY" in the sand with his big toe; he , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: scratched it out, and was angry with himself for his weakness. But he wrote it , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: again, nevertheless; he could not help it. He erased it once more and then took , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: himself out of temptation by driving the other boys together and joining them. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: But Joe's spirits had gone down almost beyond resurrection. He was so , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: homesick that he could hardly endure the misery of it. The tears lay very near the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: surface. Huck was melancholy, too. Tom was downhearted, but tried hard not to , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: show it. He had a secret which he was not ready to tell, yet, but if this mutinous , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: depression was not broken up soon, he would have to bring it out. He said, with a , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: great show of cheerfulness: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I bet there's been pirates on this island before, boys. We'll explore it again. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: They've hid treasures here somewhere. How'd you feel to light on a rotten chest , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: full of gold and silver—hey?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: But it roused only faint enthusiasm, which faded out, with no reply. Tom tried , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: one or two other seductions; but they failed, too. It was discouraging work. Joe , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: sat poking up the sand with a stick and looking very gloomy. Finally he said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Oh, boys, let's give it up. I want to go home. It's so lonesome." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Oh no, Joe, you'll feel better by and by," said Tom. "Just think of the fishing , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: that's here." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I don't care for fishing. I want to go home." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "But, Joe, there ain't such another swimming-place anywhere." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Swimming's no good. I don't seem to care for it, somehow, when there ain't , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: anybody to say I sha'n't go in. I mean to go home." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Oh, shucks! Baby! You want to see your mother, I reckon." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Yes, I DO want to see my mother—and you would, too, if you had one. I ain't , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: any more baby than you are." And Joe snuffled a little. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Well, we'll let the crybaby go home to his mother, won't we, Huck? Poor , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: thing—does it want to see its mother? And so it shall. You like it here, don't you, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Huck? We'll stay, won't we?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Huck said, "Y-e-s"—without any heart in it. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I'll never speak to you again as long as I live," said Joe, rising. "There now!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: And he moved moodily away and began to dress himself. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Who cares!" said Tom. "Nobody wants you to. Go 'long home and get laughed , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: at. Oh, you're a nice pirate. Huck and me ain't crybabies. We'll stay, won't we, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Huck? Let him go if he wants to. I reckon we can get along without him, per'aps." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: But Tom was uneasy, nevertheless, and was alarmed to see Joe go sullenly on , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: with his dressing. And then it was discomforting to see Huck eying Joe's , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: preparations so wistfully, and keeping up such an ominous silence. Presently, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: without a parting word, Joe began to wade off toward the Illinois shore. Tom's , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: heart began to sink. He glanced at Huck. Huck could not bear the look, and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: dropped his eyes. Then he said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I want to go, too, Tom. It was getting so lonesome anyway, and now it'll be , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: worse. Let's us go, too, Tom." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I won't! You can all go, if you want to. I mean to stay." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Tom, I better go." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Well, go 'long—who's hendering you." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Huck began to pick up his scattered clothes. He said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Tom, I wisht you'd come, too. Now you think it over. We'll wait for you when , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: we get to shore." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Well, you'll wait a blame long time, that's all." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Huck started sorrowfully away, and Tom stood looking after him, with a strong , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: desire tugging at his heart to yield his pride and go along too. He hoped the boys , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: would stop, but they still waded slowly on. It suddenly dawned on Tom that it , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: was become very lonely and still. He made one final struggle with his pride, and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: then darted after his comrades, yelling: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Wait! Wait! I want to tell you something!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: They presently stopped and turned around. When he got to where they were, he , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: began unfolding his secret, and they listened moodily till at last they saw the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "point" he was driving at, and then they set up a warwhoop of applause and said , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: it was "splendid!" and said if he had told them at first, they wouldn't have started , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: away. He made a plausible excuse; but his real reason had been the fear that not , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: even the secret would keep them with him any very great length of time, and so , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: he had meant to hold it in reserve as a last seduction. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: The lads came gayly back and went at their sports again with a will, chattering , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: all the time about Tom's stupendous plan and admiring the genius of it. After a , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: dainty egg and fish dinner, Tom said he wanted to learn to smoke, now. Joe , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: caught at the idea and said he would like to try, too. So Huck made pipes and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: filled them. These novices had never smoked anything before but cigars made of , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: grapevine, and they "bit" the tongue, and were not considered manly anyway. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Now they stretched themselves out on their elbows and began to puff, charily, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and with slender confidence. The smoke had an unpleasant taste, and they gagged , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: a little, but Tom said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Why, it's just as easy! If I'd a knowed this was all, I'd a learnt long ago." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "So would I," said Joe. "It's just nothing." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Why, many a time I've looked at people smoking, and thought well I wish I , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: could do that; but I never thought I could," said Tom. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "That's just the way with me, hain't it, Huck? You've heard me talk just that , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: way—haven't you, Huck? I'll leave it to Huck if I haven't." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Yes—heaps of times," said Huck. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Well, I have too," said Tom; "oh, hundreds of times. Once down by the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: slaughter-house. Don't you remember, Huck? Bob Tanner was there, and Johnny , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Miller, and Jeff Thatcher, when I said it. Don't you remember, Huck, 'bout me , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: saying that?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Yes, that's so," said Huck. "That was the day after I lost a white alley. No, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: 'twas the day before." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "There—I told you so," said Tom. "Huck recollects it." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I bleeve I could smoke this pipe all day," said Joe. "I don't feel sick." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Neither do I," said Tom. "I could smoke it all day. But I bet you Jeff Thatcher , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: couldn't." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Jeff Thatcher! Why, he'd keel over just with two draws. Just let him try it once. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: HE'D see!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I bet he would. And Johnny Miller—I wish could see Johnny Miller tackle it , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: once." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Oh, don't I!" said Joe. "Why, I bet you Johnny Miller couldn't any more do this , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: than nothing. Just one little snifter would fetch HIM." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "'Deed it would, Joe. Say—I wish the boys could see us now." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "So do I." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Say—boys, don't say anything about it, and some time when they're around, I'll , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: come up to you and say, 'Joe, got a pipe? I want a smoke.' And you'll say, kind of , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: careless like, as if it warn't anything, you'll say, 'Yes, I got my OLD pipe, and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: another one, but my tobacker ain't very good.' And I'll say, 'Oh, that's all right, if , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: it's STRONG enough.' And then you'll out with the pipes, and we'll light up just as , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: ca'm, and then just see 'em look!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "By jings, that'll be gay, Tom! I wish it was NOW!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "So do I! And when we tell 'em we learned when we was off pirating, won't they , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: wish they'd been along?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Oh, I reckon not! I'll just BET they will!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: So the talk ran on. But presently it began to flag a trifle, and grow disjointed. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: The silences widened; the expectoration marvellously increased. Every pore inside , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the boys' cheeks became a spouting fountain; they could scarcely bail out the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: cellars under their tongues fast enough to prevent an inundation; little , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: overflowings down their throats occurred in spite of all they could do, and sudden , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: retchings followed every time. Both boys were looking very pale and miserable, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: now. Joe's pipe dropped from his nerveless fingers. Tom's followed. Both fountains , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: were going furiously and both pumps bailing with might and main. Joe said feebly: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I've lost my knife. I reckon I better go and find it." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Tom said, with quivering lips and halting utterance: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I'll help you. You go over that way and I'll hunt around by the spring. No, you , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: needn't come, Huck—we can find it." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: So Huck sat down again, and waited an hour. Then he found it lonesome, and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: went to find his comrades. They were wide apart in the woods, both very pale, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: both fast asleep. But something informed him that if they had had any trouble , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: they had got rid of it. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: They were not talkative at supper that night. They had a humble look, and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: when Huck prepared his pipe after the meal and was going to prepare theirs, they , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: said no, they were not feeling very well—something they ate at dinner had , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: disagreed with them. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: About midnight Joe awoke, and called the boys. There was a brooding , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: oppressiveness in the air that seemed to bode something. The boys huddled , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: dull dead heat of the breathless atmosphere was stifling. They sat still, intent and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: waiting. The solemn hush continued. Beyond the light of the fire everything was , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: swallowed up in the blackness of darkness. Presently there came a quivering glow , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: that vaguely revealed the foliage for a moment and then vanished. By and by , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: another came, a little stronger. Then another. Then a faint moan came sighing , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: through the branches of the forest and the boys felt a fleeting breath upon their , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: cheeks, and shuddered with the fancy that the Spirit of the Night had gone by. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: There was a pause. Now a weird flash turned night into day and showed every , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: little grassblade, separate and distinct, that grew about their feet. And it showed , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: three white, startled faces, too. A deep peal of thunder went rolling and tumbling , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: down the heavens and lost itself in sullen rumblings in the distance. A sweep of , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: chilly air passed by, rustling all the leaves and snowing the flaky ashes broadcast , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: about the fire. Another fierce glare lit up the forest and an instant crash followed , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: that seemed to rend the treetops right over the boys' heads. They clung together in , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: terror, in the thick gloom that followed. A few big raindrops fell pattering upon , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the leaves. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Quick! boys, go for the tent!" exclaimed Tom. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: They sprang away, stumbling over roots and among vines in the dark, no two , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: plunging in the same direction. A furious blast roared through the trees, making , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: everything sing as it went. One blinding flash after another came, and peal on , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: peal of deafening thunder. And now a drenching rain poured down and the rising , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: hurricane drove it in sheets along the ground. The boys cried out to each other, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: but the roaring wind and the booming thunderblasts drowned their voices utterly. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: However, one by one they straggled in at last and took shelter under the tent, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: cold, scared, and streaming with water; but to have company in misery seemed , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: something to be grateful for. They could not talk, the old sail flapped so furiously, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: even if the other noises would have allowed them. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: The tempest rose higher and higher, and presently the sail tore loose from its , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: fastenings and went winging away on the blast. The boys seized each others' , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: hands and fled, with many tumblings and bruises, to the shelter of a great oak , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: that stood upon the riverbank. Now the battle was at its highest. Under the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: ceaseless conflagration of lightning that flamed in the skies, everything below , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: stood out in cleancut and shadowless distinctness: the bending trees, the billowy , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: river, white with foam, the driving spray of spumeflakes, the dim outlines of the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: high bluffs on the other side, glimpsed through the drifting cloudrack and the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: slanting veil of rain. Every little while some giant tree yielded the fight and fell , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: crashing through the younger growth; and the unflagging thunderpeals came now , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: in ear-splitting explosive bursts, keen and sharp, and unspeakably appalling. The , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: storm culminated in one matchless effort that seemed likely to tear the island to , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: pieces, burn it up, drown it to the treetops, blow it away, and deafen every , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: creature in it, all at one and the same moment. It was a wild night for homeless , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: young heads to be out in. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: But at last the battle was done, and the forces retired with weaker and weaker , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: threatenings and grumblings, and peace resumed her sway. The boys went back to , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: camp, a good deal awed; but they found there was still something to be thankful , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: for, because the great sycamore, the shelter of their beds, was a ruin, now, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: blasted by the lightnings, and they were not under it when the catastrophe , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: happened. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Everything in camp was drenched, the campfire as well; for they were but , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: heedless lads, like their generation, and had made no provision against rain. Here , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: was matter for dismay, for they were soaked through and chilled. They were , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: eloquent in their distress; but they presently discovered that the fire had eaten so , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: far up under the great log it had been built against (where it curved upward and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: separated itself from the ground), that a handbreadth or so of it had escaped , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: wetting; so they patiently wrought until, with shreds and bark gathered from the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: under sides of sheltered logs, they coaxed the fire to burn again. Then they piled , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: on great dead boughs till they had a roaring furnace, and were gladhearted once , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: more. They dried their boiled ham and had a feast, and after that they sat by the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: fire and expanded and glorified their midnight adventure until morning, for there , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: was not a dry spot to sleep on, anywhere around. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: As the sun began to steal in upon the boys, drowsiness came over them, and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: they went out on the sandbar and lay down to sleep. They got scorched out by , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and by, and drearily set about getting breakfast. After the meal they felt rusty, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and stiff-jointed, and a little homesick once more. Tom saw the signs, and fell to , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: cheering up the pirates as well as he could. But they cared nothing for marbles, or , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: circus, or swimming, or anything. He reminded them of the imposing secret, and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: raised a ray of cheer. While it lasted, he got them interested in a new device. This , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: was to knock off being pirates, for a while, and be Indians for a change. They , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: were attracted by this idea; so it was not long before they were stripped, and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: striped from head to heel with black mud, like so many zebras—all of them chiefs, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: of course—and then they went tearing through the woods to attack an English , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: settlement. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: By and by they separated into three hostile tribes, and darted upon each other , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: from ambush with dreadful warwhoops, and killed and scalped each other by , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: thousands. It was a gory day. Consequently it was an extremely satisfactory one. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: They assembled in camp toward suppertime, hungry and happy; but now a , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: difficulty arose—hostile Indians could not break the bread of hospitality together , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: without first making peace, and this was a simple impossibility without smoking a , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: pipe of peace. There was no other process that ever they had heard of. Two of the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: savages almost wished they had remained pirates. However, there was no other , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: way; so with such show of cheerfulness as they could muster they called for the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: pipe and took their whiff as it passed, in due form. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: And behold, they were glad they had gone into savagery, for they had gained , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: something; they found that they could now smoke a little without having to go , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and hunt for a lost knife; they did not get sick enough to be seriously , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: uncomfortable. They were not likely to fool away this high promise for lack of , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: effort. No, they practised cautiously, after supper, with right fair success, and so , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: they spent a jubilant evening. They were prouder and happier in their new , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: acquirement than they would have been in the scalping and skinning of the Six , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: CHAPTER XVII , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Bold, Size: 18.0
Text: BUT there was no hilarity in the little town that same tranquil Saturday , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: afternoon. The Harpers, and Aunt Polly's family, were being put into mourning, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: with great grief and many tears. An unusual quiet possessed the village, although , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: it was ordinarily quiet enough, in all conscience. The villagers conducted their , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: concerns with an absent air, and talked little; but they sighed often. The Saturday , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: holiday seemed a burden to the children. They had no heart in their sports, and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: gradually gave them up. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: In the afternoon Becky Thatcher found herself moping about the deserted , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: schoolhouse yard, and feeling very melancholy. But she found nothing there to , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: comfort her. She soliloquized: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Oh, if I only had a brass andiron-knob again! But I haven't got anything now to , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: remember him by." And she choked back a little sob. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Presently she stopped, and said to herself: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "It was right here. Oh, if it was to do over again, I wouldn't say that—I wouldn't , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: say it for the whole world. But he's gone now; I'll never, never, never see him any , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: more." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: This thought broke her down, and she wandered away, with tears rolling down , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: her cheeks. Then quite a group of boys and girls—playmates of Tom's and Joe's—, Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: came by, and stood looking over the paling fence and talking in reverent tones of , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: how Tom did so-and-so the last time they saw him, and how Joe said this and that , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: small trifle (pregnant with awful prophecy, as they could easily see now!)—and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: each speaker pointed out the exact spot where the lost lads stood at the time, and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: then added something like "and I was a-standing just so—just as I am now, and as , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: if you was him—I was as close as that—and he smiled, just this way—and then , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: something seemed to go all over me, like—awful, you know—and I never thought , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: what it meant, of course, but I can see now!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Then there was a dispute about who saw the dead boys last in life, and many , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: claimed that dismal distinction, and offered evidences, more or less tampered , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: with by the witness; and when it was ultimately decided who DID see the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: departed last, and exchanged the last words with them, the lucky parties took , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: upon themselves a sort of sacred importance, and were gaped at and envied by all , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the rest. One poor chap, who had no other grandeur to offer, said with tolerably , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: manifest pride in the remembrance: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Well, Tom Sawyer he licked me once." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: But that bid for glory was a failure. Most of the boys could say that, and so that , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: cheapened the distinction too much. The group loitered away, still recalling , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: memories of the lost heroes, in awed voices. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: When the Sunday-school hour was finished, the next morning, the bell began to , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: toll, instead of ringing in the usual way. It was a very still Sabbath, and the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: mournful sound seemed in keeping with the musing hush that lay upon nature. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: The villagers began to gather, loitering a moment in the vestibule to converse in , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: whispers about the sad event. But there was no whispering in the house; only the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: funereal rustling of dresses as the women gathered to their seats disturbed the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: silence there. None could remember when the little church had been so full , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: before. There was finally a waiting pause, an expectant dumbness, and then Aunt , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Polly entered, followed by Sid and Mary, and they by the Harper family, all in , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: deep black, and the whole congregation, the old minister as well, rose reverently , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and stood until the mourners were seated in the front pew. There was another , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: communing silence, broken at intervals by muffled sobs, and then the minister , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: spread his hands abroad and prayed. A moving hymn was sung, and the text , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: followed: "I am the Resurrection and the Life." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: As the service proceeded, the clergyman drew such pictures of the graces, the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: winning ways, and the rare promise of the lost lads that every soul there, thinking , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: he recognized these pictures, felt a pang in remembering that he had persistently , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: blinded himself to them always before, and had as persistently seen only faults , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and flaws in the poor boys. The minister related many a touching incident in the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: lives of the departed, too, which illustrated their sweet, generous natures, and the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: people could easily see, now, how noble and beautiful those episodes were, and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: remembered with grief that at the time they occurred they had seemed rank , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: rascalities, well deserving of the cowhide. The congregation became more and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: more moved, as the pathetic tale went on, till at last the whole company broke , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: down and joined the weeping mourners in a chorus of anguished sobs, the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: preacher himself giving way to his feelings, and crying in the pulpit. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: There was a rustle in the gallery, which nobody noticed; a moment later the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: church door creaked; the minister raised his streaming eyes above his , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: handkerchief, and stood transfixed! First one and then another pair of eyes , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: followed the minister's, and then almost with one impulse the congregation rose , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and stared while the three dead boys came marching up the aisle, Tom in the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: They had been hid in the unused gallery listening to their own funeral sermon! , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Aunt Polly, Mary, and the Harpers threw themselves upon their restored ones, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: smothered them with kisses and poured out thanksgivings, while poor Huck stood , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: abashed and uncomfortable, not knowing exactly what to do or where to hide , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: from so many unwelcoming eyes. He wavered, and started to slink away, but Tom , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: seized him and said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Aunt Polly, it ain't fair. Somebody's got to be glad to see Huck." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "And so they shall. I'm glad to see him, poor motherless thing!" And the loving , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: attentions Aunt Polly lavished upon him were the one thing capable of making , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: him more uncomfortable than he was before. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Suddenly the minister shouted at the top of his voice: "Praise God from whom , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: all blessings flow—SING!—and put your hearts in it!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: And they did. Old Hundred swelled up with a triumphant burst, and while it , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: about him and confessed in his heart that this was the proudest moment of his , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: life. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: As the "sold" congregation trooped out they said they would almost be willing to , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: be made ridiculous again to hear Old Hundred sung like that once more. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: THAT was Tom's great secret—the scheme to return home with his brother , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: pirates and attend their own funerals. They had paddled over to the Missouri , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: shore on a log, at dusk on Saturday, landing five or six miles below the village; , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: they had slept in the woods at the edge of the town till nearly daylight, and had , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: then crept through back lanes and alleys and finished their sleep in the gallery of , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the church among a chaos of invalided benches. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: At breakfast, Monday morning, Aunt Polly and Mary were very loving to Tom, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and very attentive to his wants. There was an unusual amount of talk. In the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: course of it Aunt Polly said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Well, I don't say it wasn't a fine joke, Tom, to keep everybody suffering 'most a , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: week so you boys had a good time, but it is a pity you could be so hard-hearted as , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: to let me suffer so. If you could come over on a log to go to your funeral, you , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: could have come over and give me a hint some way that you warn't dead, but only , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: run off." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Yes, you could have done that, Tom," said Mary; "and I believe you would if , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: you had thought of it." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Would you, Tom?" said Aunt Polly, her face lighting wistfully. "Say, now, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: would you, if you'd thought of it?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I—well, I don't know. 'Twould 'a' spoiled everything." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Tom, I hoped you loved me that much," said Aunt Polly, with a grieved tone , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: that discomforted the boy. "It would have been something if you'd cared enough to , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: THINK of it, even if you didn't DO it." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Now, auntie, that ain't any harm," pleaded Mary; "it's only Tom's giddy way—, Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: he is always in such a rush that he never thinks of anything." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "More's the pity. Sid would have thought. And Sid would have come and DONE , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: it, too. Tom, you'll look back, some day, when it's too late, and wish you'd cared a , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: little more for me when it would have cost you so little." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Now, auntie, you know I do care for you," said Tom. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I'd know it better if you acted more like it." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I wish now I'd thought," said Tom, with a repentant tone; "but I dreamt about , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: you, anyway. That's something, ain't it?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "It ain't much—a cat does that much—but it's better than nothing. What did you , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: dream?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Why, Wednesday night I dreamt that you was sitting over there by the bed, and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Sid was sitting by the woodbox, and Mary next to him." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Well, so we did. So we always do. I'm glad your dreams could take even that , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: much trouble about us." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "And I dreamt that Joe Harper's mother was here." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Why, she was here! Did you dream any more?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Oh, lots. But it's so dim, now." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Well, try to recollect—can't you?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Somehow it seems to me that the wind—the wind blowed the—the—" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Try harder, Tom! The wind did blow something. Come!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Tom pressed his fingers on his forehead an anxious minute, and then said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I've got it now! I've got it now! It blowed the candle!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Mercy on us! Go on, Tom—go on!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "And it seems to me that you said, 'Why, I believe that that door—'" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Go ON, Tom!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Just let me study a moment—just a moment. Oh, yes—you said you believed , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the door was open." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "As I'm sitting here, I did! Didn't I, Mary! Go on!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "And then—and then—well I won't be certain, but it seems like as if you made , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Sid go and—and—" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Well? Well? What did I make him do, Tom? What did I make him do?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "You made him—you—Oh, you made him shut it." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Well, for the land's sake! I never heard the beat of that in all my days! Don't , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: tell ME there ain't anything in dreams, any more. Sereny Harper shall know of , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: this before I'm an hour older. I'd like to see her get around THIS with her rubbage , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: 'bout superstition. Go on, Tom!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Oh, it's all getting just as bright as day, now. Next you said I warn't BAD, only , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: mischeevous and harum-scarum, and not any more responsible than—than—I , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: think it was a colt, or something." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "And so it was! Well, goodness gracious! Go on, Tom!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "And then you began to cry." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "So I did. So I did. Not the first time, neither. And then—" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Then Mrs. Harper she began to cry, and said Joe was just the same, and she , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: "Then Sid he said—he said—" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I don't think I said anything," said Sid. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Yes you did, Sid," said Mary. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Shut your heads and let Tom go on! What did he say, Tom?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "He said—I THINK he said he hoped I was better off where I was gone to, but if , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: I'd been better sometimes—" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "THERE, d'you hear that! It was his very words!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "And you shut him up sharp." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I lay I did! There must 'a' been an angel there. There WAS an angel there, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: somewheres!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "And Mrs. Harper told about Joe scaring her with a firecracker, and you told , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: about Peter and the Pain-killer—" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Just as true as I live!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "And then there was a whole lot of talk 'bout dragging the river for us, and 'bout , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: having the funeral Sunday, and then you and old Miss Harper hugged and cried, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and she went." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "It happened just so! It happened just so, as sure as I'm a-sitting in these very , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: tracks. Tom, you couldn't told it more like if you'd 'a' seen it! And then what? Go , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: on, Tom!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Then I thought you prayed for me—and I could see you and hear every word , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: you said. And you went to bed, and I was so sorry that I took and wrote on a , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: piece of sycamore bark, 'We ain't dead—we are only off being pirates,' and put it , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: on the table by the candle; and then you looked so good, laying there asleep, that , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: I thought I went and leaned over and kissed you on the lips." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Did you, Tom, DID you! I just forgive you everything for that!" And she seized , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the boy in a crushing embrace that made him feel like the guiltiest of villains. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "It was very kind, even though it was only a—dream," Sid soliloquized just , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: audibly. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Shut up, Sid! A body does just the same in a dream as he'd do if he was awake. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Here's a big Milum apple I've been saving for you, Tom, if you was ever found , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: again—now go 'long to school. I'm thankful to the good God and Father of us all , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: I've got you back, that's long-suffering and merciful to them that believe on Him , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: places, there's few enough would smile here or ever enter into His rest when the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: long night comes. Go 'long Sid, Mary, Tom—take yourselves off—you've hendered , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: me long enough." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: The children left for school, and the old lady to call on Mrs. Harper and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: vanquish her realism with Tom's marvellous dream. Sid had better judgment than , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: to utter the thought that was in his mind as he left the house. It was this: "Pretty , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: thin—as long a dream as that, without any mistakes in it!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: What a hero Tom was become, now! He did not go skipping and prancing, but , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: moved with a dignified swagger as became a pirate who felt that the public eye , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: was on him. And indeed it was; he tried not to seem to see the looks or hear the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: remarks as he passed along, but they were food and drink to him. Smaller boys , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: than himself flocked at his heels, as proud to be seen with him, and tolerated by , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: him, as if he had been the drummer at the head of a procession or the elephant , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: leading a menagerie into town. Boys of his own size pretended not to know he had , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: been away at all; but they were consuming with envy, nevertheless. They would , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: have given anything to have that swarthy sun-tanned skin of his, and his glittering , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: notoriety; and Tom would not have parted with either for a circus. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: At school the children made so much of him and of Joe, and delivered such , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: eloquent admiration from their eyes, that the two heroes were not long in , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: becoming insufferably "stuck-up." They began to tell their adventures to hungry , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: listeners—but they only began; it was not a thing likely to have an end, with , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: imaginations like theirs to furnish material. And finally, when they got out their , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: pipes and went serenely puffing around, the very summit of glory was reached. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Tom decided that he could be independent of Becky Thatcher now. Glory was , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: sufficient. He would live for glory. Now that he was distinguished, maybe she , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: would be wanting to "make up." Well, let her—she should see that he could be as , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: indifferent as some other people. Presently she arrived. Tom pretended not to see , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: her. He moved away and joined a group of boys and girls and began to talk. Soon , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: he observed that she was tripping gayly back and forth with flushed face and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: dancing eyes, pretending to be busy chasing schoolmates, and screaming with , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: laughter when she made a capture; but he noticed that she always made her , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: captures in his vicinity, and that she seemed to cast a conscious eye in his , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: direction at such times, too. It gratified all the vicious vanity that was in him; and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: so, instead of winning him, it only "set him up" the more and made him the more , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: diligent to avoid betraying that he knew she was about. Presently she gave over , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: skylarking, and moved irresolutely about, sighing once or twice and glancing , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: furtively and wistfully toward Tom. Then she observed that now Tom was talking , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: more particularly to Amy Lawrence than to any one else. She felt a sharp pang , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and grew disturbed and uneasy at once. She tried to go away, but her feet were , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: treacherous, and carried her to the group instead. She said to a girl almost at , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Tom's elbow—with sham vivacity: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Why, Mary Austin! you bad girl, why didn't you come to Sunday-school?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I did come—didn't you see me?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Why, no! Did you? Where did you sit?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I was in Miss Peters' class, where I always go. I saw YOU." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Did you? Why, it's funny I didn't see you. I wanted to tell you about the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: picnic." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Oh, that's jolly. Who's going to give it?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "My ma's going to let me have one." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Oh, goody; I hope she'll let ME come." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Well, she will. The picnic's for me. She'll let anybody come that I want, and I , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: want you." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "That's ever so nice. When is it going to be?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "By and by. Maybe about vacation." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Oh, won't it be fun! You going to have all the girls and boys?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Yes, every one that's friends to me—or wants to be"; and she glanced ever so , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: furtively at Tom, but he talked right along to Amy Lawrence about the terrible , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: storm on the island, and how the lightning tore the great sycamore tree "all to , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: flinders" while he was "standing within three feet of it." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Oh, may I come?" said Grace Miller. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Yes." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "And me?" said Sally Rogers. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Yes." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "And me, too?" said Susy Harper. "And Joe?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Yes." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: And so on, with clapping of joyful hands till all the group had begged for , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: invitations but Tom and Amy. Then Tom turned coolly away, still talking, and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: took Amy with him. Becky's lips trembled and the tears came to her eyes; she hid , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: these signs with a forced gayety and went on chattering, but the life had gone out , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: of the picnic, now, and out of everything else; she got away as soon as she could , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and hid herself and had what her sex call "a good cry." Then she sat moody, with , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: wounded pride, till the bell rang. She roused up, now, with a vindictive cast in , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: her eye, and gave her plaited tails a shake and said she knew what SHE'D do. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: At recess Tom continued his flirtation with Amy with jubilant self-satisfaction. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: And he kept drifting about to find Becky and lacerate her with the performance. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: At last he spied her, but there was a sudden falling of his mercury. She was sitting , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: cosily on a little bench behind the schoolhouse looking at a picture-book with , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Alfred Temple—and so absorbed were they, and their heads so close together over , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the book, that they did not seem to be conscious of anything in the world besides. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Jealousy ran red-hot through Tom's veins. He began to hate himself for throwing , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: away the chance Becky had offered for a reconciliation. He called himself a fool, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and all the hard names he could think of. He wanted to cry with vexation. Amy , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: chatted happily along, as they walked, for her heart was singing, but Tom's tongue , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: had lost its function. He did not hear what Amy was saying, and whenever she , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: paused expectantly he could only stammer an awkward assent, which was as , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: often misplaced as otherwise. He kept drifting to the rear of the schoolhouse, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: again and again, to sear his eyeballs with the hateful spectacle there. He could not , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: help it. And it maddened him to see, as he thought he saw, that Becky Thatcher , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: never once suspected that he was even in the land of the living. But she did see, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: nevertheless; and she knew she was winning her fight, too, and was glad to see , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: him suffer as she had suffered. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Amy's happy prattle became intolerable. Tom hinted at things he had to attend , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: to; things that must be done; and time was fleeting. But in vain—the girl chirped , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: on. Tom thought, "Oh, hang her, ain't I ever going to get rid of her?" At last he , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: must be attending to those things—and she said artlessly that she would be , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "around" when school let out. And he hastened away, hating her for it. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Any other boy!" Tom thought, grating his teeth. "Any boy in the whole town , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: but that Saint Louis smarty that thinks he dresses so fine and is aristocracy! Oh, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: all right, I licked you the first day you ever saw this town, mister, and I'll lick you , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: again! You just wait till I catch you out! I'll just take and—" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: And he went through the motions of thrashing an imaginary boy—pummelling , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the air, and kicking and gouging. "Oh, you do, do you? You holler 'nough, do you? , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Now, then, let that learn you!" And so the imaginary flogging was finished to his , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: satisfaction. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Tom fled home at noon. His conscience could not endure any more of Amy's , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: grateful happiness, and his jealousy could bear no more of the other distress. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Becky resumed her picture inspections with Alfred, but as the minutes dragged , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: along and no Tom came to suffer, her triumph began to cloud and she lost , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: interest; gravity and absentmindedness followed, and then melancholy; two or , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: three times she pricked up her ear at a footstep, but it was a false hope; no Tom , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: came. At last she grew entirely miserable and wished she hadn't carried it so far. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: When poor Alfred, seeing that he was losing her, he did not know how, kept , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: exclaiming: "Oh, here's a jolly one! look at this!" she lost patience at last, and said, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Oh, don't bother me! I don't care for them!" and burst into tears, and got up and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: walked away. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: TOM arrived at home in a dreary mood, and the first thing his aunt said to him , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: "Tom, I've a notion to skin you alive!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Auntie, what have I done?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Well, you've done enough. Here I go over to Sereny Harper, like an old softy, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: expecting I'm going to make her believe all that rubbage about that dream, when , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: lo and behold you she'd found out from Joe that you was over here and heard all , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the talk we had that night. Tom, I don't know what is to become of a boy that will , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: Harper and make such a fool of myself and never say a word." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: This was a new aspect of the thing. His smartness of the morning had seemed , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: to Tom a good joke before, and very ingenious. It merely looked mean and shabby , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: now. He hung his head and could not think of anything to say for a moment. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Then he said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Auntie, I wish I hadn't done it—but I didn't think." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Oh, child, you never think. You never think of anything but your own , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: selfishness. You could think to come all the way over here from Jackson's Island , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: in the night to laugh at our troubles, and you could think to fool me with a lie , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: about a dream; but you couldn't ever think to pity us and save us from sorrow." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Auntie, I know now it was mean, but I didn't mean to be mean. I didn't, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: honest. And besides, I didn't come over here to laugh at you that night." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "What did you come for, then?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "It was to tell you not to be uneasy about us, because we hadn't got drownded." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Tom, Tom, I would be the thankfullest soul in this world if I could believe you , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: Tom." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Indeed and 'deed I did, auntie—I wish I may never stir if I didn't." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Oh, Tom, don't lie—don't do it. It only makes things a hundred times worse." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "It ain't a lie, auntie; it's the truth. I wanted to keep you from grieving—that , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: "I'd give the whole world to believe that—it would cover up a power of sins, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Tom. I'd 'most be glad you'd run off and acted so bad. But it ain't reasonable; , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: because, why didn't you tell me, child?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Why, you see, when you got to talking about the funeral, I just got all full of , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the idea of our coming and hiding in the church, and I couldn't somehow bear to , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: spoil it. So I just put the bark back in my pocket and kept mum." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "What bark?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "The bark I had wrote on to tell you we'd gone pirating. I wish, now, you'd , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: waked up when I kissed you—I do, honest." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: The hard lines in his aunt's face relaxed and a sudden tenderness dawned in her , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: eyes. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "DID you kiss me, Tom?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Why, yes, I did." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Are you sure you did, Tom?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Why, yes, I did, auntie—certain sure." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "What did you kiss me for, Tom?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Because I loved you so, and you laid there moaning and I was so sorry." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: The words sounded like truth. The old lady could not hide a tremor in her voice , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: when she said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Kiss me again, Tom!—and be off with you to school, now, and don't bother me , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: any more." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: The moment he was gone, she ran to a closet and got out the ruin of a jacket , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: which Tom had gone pirating in. Then she stopped, with it in her hand, and said , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: to herself: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "No, I don't dare. Poor boy, I reckon he's lied about it—but it's a blessed, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: blessed lie, there's such a comfort come from it. I hope the Lord—I KNOW the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Lord will forgive him, because it was such good-heartedness in him to tell it. But I , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: don't want to find out it's a lie. I won't look." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: She put the jacket away, and stood by musing a minute. Twice she put out her , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: hand to take the garment again, and twice she refrained. Once more she ventured, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and this time she fortified herself with the thought: "It's a good lie—it's a good , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: lie—I won't let it grieve me." So she sought the jacket pocket. A moment later she , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: was reading Tom's piece of bark through flowing tears and saying: "I could forgive , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: started to school and had the luck of coming upon Becky Thatcher at the head of , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Meadow Lane. His mood always determined his manner. Without a moment's , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: hesitation he ran to her and said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I acted mighty mean today, Becky, and I'm so sorry. I won't ever, ever do that , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: way again, as long as ever I live—please make up, won't you?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: The girl stopped and looked him scornfully in the face: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I'll thank you to keep yourself TO yourself, Mr. Thomas Sawyer. I'll never , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: speak to you again." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: She tossed her head and passed on. Tom was so stunned that he had not even , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: presence of mind enough to say "Who cares, Miss Smarty?" until the right time to , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: say it had gone by. So he said nothing. But he was in a fine rage, nevertheless. He , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: moped into the schoolyard wishing she were a boy, and imagining how he would , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: trounce her if she were. He presently encountered her and delivered a stinging , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: remark as he passed. She hurled one in return, and the angry breach was , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: complete. It seemed to Becky, in her hot resentment, that she could hardly wait , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: for school to "take in," she was so impatient to see Tom flogged for the injured , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: spelling-book. If she had had any lingering notion of exposing Alfred Temple, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Tom's offensive fling had driven it entirely away. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Poor girl, she did not know how fast she was nearing trouble herself. The , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: master, Mr. Dobbins, had reached middle age with an unsatisfied ambition. The , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: darling of his desires was, to be a doctor, but poverty had decreed that he should , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: be nothing higher than a village schoolmaster. Every day he took a mysterious , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: book out of his desk and absorbed himself in it at times when no classes were , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: reciting. He kept that book under lock and key. There was not an urchin in school , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: but was perishing to have a glimpse of it, but the chance never came. Every boy , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and girl had a theory about the nature of that book; but no two theories were , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: alike, and there was no way of getting at the facts in the case. Now, as Becky was , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: passing by the desk, which stood near the door, she noticed that the key was in , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the lock! It was a precious moment. She glanced around; found herself alone, and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the next instant she had the book in her hands. The titlepage—Professor , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Somebody's ANATOMY—carried no information to her mind; so she began to turn , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the leaves. She came at once upon a handsomely engraved and colored , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: frontispiece—a human figure, stark naked. At that moment a shadow fell on the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: Becky snatched at the book to close it, and had the hard luck to tear the pictured , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: page half down the middle. She thrust the volume into the desk, turned the key, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and burst out crying with shame and vexation. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Tom Sawyer, you are just as mean as you can be, to sneak up on a person and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text:  , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "How could I know you was looking at anything?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "You ought to be ashamed of yourself, Tom Sawyer; you know you're going to , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: tell on me, and oh, what shall I do, what shall I do! I'll be whipped, and I never , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: was whipped in school." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Then she stamped her little foot and said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "BE so mean if you want to! I know something that's going to happen. You just , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: wait and you'll see! Hateful, hateful, hateful!"—and she flung out of the house , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: with a new explosion of crying. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Tom stood still, rather flustered by this onslaught. Presently he said to himself: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "What a curious kind of a fool a girl is! Never been licked in school! Shucks! , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: What's a licking! That's just like a girl—they're so thin-skinned and chicken-, Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: hearted. Well, of course I ain't going to tell old Dobbins on this little fool, because , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: there's other ways of getting even on her, that ain't so mean; but what of it? Old , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Dobbins will ask who it was tore his book. Nobody'll answer. Then he'll do just , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the way he always does—ask first one and then t'other, and when he comes to the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: right girl he'll know it, without any telling. Girls' faces always tell on them. They , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: ain't got any backbone. She'll get licked. Well, it's a kind of a tight place for Becky , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Thatcher, because there ain't any way out of it." Tom conned the thing a moment , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: longer, and then added: "All right, though; she'd like to see me in just such a fix—, Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: let her sweat it out!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Tom joined the mob of skylarking scholars outside. In a few moments the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: master arrived and school "took in." Tom did not feel a strong interest in his , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: studies. Every time he stole a glance at the girls' side of the room Becky's face , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: troubled him. Considering all things, he did not want to pity her, and yet it was , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: all he could do to help it. He could get up no exultation that was really worthy the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: name. Presently the spelling-book discovery was made, and Tom's mind was , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: entirely full of his own matters for a while after that. Becky roused up from her , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: lethargy of distress and showed good interest in the proceedings. She did not , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: expect that Tom could get out of his trouble by denying that he spilt the ink on , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the book himself; and she was right. The denial only seemed to make the thing , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: worse for Tom. Becky supposed she would be glad of that, and she tried to believe , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: she was glad of it, but she found she was not certain. When the worst came to the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: worst, she had an impulse to get up and tell on Alfred Temple, but she made an , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: effort and forced herself to keep still—because, said she to herself, "he'll tell about , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: me tearing the picture sure. I wouldn't say a word, not to save his life!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Tom took his whipping and went back to his seat not at all broken-hearted, for , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: he thought it was possible that he had unknowingly upset the ink on the spelling-, Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: book himself, in some skylarking bout—he had denied it for form's sake and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: because it was custom, and had stuck to the denial from principle. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: A whole hour drifted by, the master sat nodding in his throne, the air was , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: drowsy with the hum of study. By and by, Mr. Dobbins straightened himself up, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: yawned, then unlocked his desk, and reached for his book, but seemed undecided , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: whether to take it out or leave it. Most of the pupils glanced up languidly, but , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: there were two among them that watched his movements with intent eyes. Mr. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Dobbins fingered his book absently for a while, then took it out and settled , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: himself in his chair to read! Tom shot a glance at Becky. He had seen a hunted , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and helpless rabbit look as she did, with a gun levelled at its head. Instantly he , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: forgot his quarrel with her. Quick—something must be done! done in a flash, too! , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: But the very imminence of the emergency paralyzed his invention. Good!—he had , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: an inspiration! He would run and snatch the book, spring through the door and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: fly. But his resolution shook for one little instant, and the chance was lost—the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: master opened the volume. If Tom only had the wasted opportunity back again! , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Too late. There was no help for Becky now, he said. The next moment the master , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: faced the school. Every eye sank under his gaze. There was that in it which smote , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: even the innocent with fear. There was silence while one might count ten—the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: master was gathering his wrath. Then he spoke: "Who tore this book?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: There was not a sound. One could have heard a pin drop. The stillness , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: continued; the master searched face after face for signs of guilt. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Benjamin Rogers, did you tear this book?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: A denial. Another pause. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Joseph Harper, did you?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Another denial. Tom's uneasiness grew more and more intense under the slow , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: while, then turned to the girls: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Amy Lawrence?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: CHAPTER XXII , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Bold, Size: 18.0
Text: TOM joined the new order of Cadets of Temperance, being attracted by the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: showy character of their "regalia." He promised to abstain from smoking, chewing, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and profanity as long as he remained a member. Now he found out a new thing—, Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: namely, that to promise not to do a thing is the surest way in the world to make a , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: body want to go and do that very thing. Tom soon found himself tormented with , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: a desire to drink and swear; the desire grew to be so intense that nothing but the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: hope of a chance to display himself in his red sash kept him from withdrawing , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: from the order. Fourth of July was coming; but he soon gave that up—gave it up , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: before he had worn his shackles over forty-eight hours—and fixed his hopes upon , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: old Judge Frazer, justice of the peace, who was apparently on his deathbed and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: would have a big public funeral, since he was so high an official. During three , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: days Tom was deeply concerned about the Judge's condition and hungry for news , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: of it. Sometimes his hopes ran high—so high that he would venture to get out his , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: regalia and practise before the looking-glass. But the Judge had a most , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: discouraging way of fluctuating. At last he was pronounced upon the mend—and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: then convalescent. Tom was disgusted; and felt a sense of injury, too. He handed , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: in his resignation at once—and that night the Judge suffered a relapse and died. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Tom resolved that he would never trust a man like that again. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: The funeral was a fine thing. The Cadets paraded in a style calculated to kill the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: late member with envy. Tom was a free boy again, however—there was something , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: in that. He could drink and swear, now—but found to his surprise that he did not , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: want to. The simple fact that he could, took the desire away, and the charm of it. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: A circus came. The boys played circus for three days afterward in tents made of , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: hoping against hope for the sight of one blessed sinful face, but disappointment , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: crossed him everywhere. He found Joe Harper studying a Testament, and turned , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: sadly away from the depressing spectacle. He sought Ben Rogers, and found him , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: visiting the poor with a basket of tracts. He hunted up Jim Hollis, who called his , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: And that night there came on a terrific storm, with driving rain, awful claps of , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: thunder and blinding sheets of lightning. He covered his head with the bedclothes , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and waited in a horror of suspense for his doom; for he had not the shadow of a , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: forbearance of the powers above to the extremity of endurance and that this was , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: for there might not be any more storms. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: The next day the doctors were back; Tom had relapsed. The three weeks he , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: spent on his back this time seemed an entire age. When he got abroad at last he , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: was hardly grateful that he had been spared, remembering how lonely was his , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: AT last the sleepy atmosphere was stirred—and vigorously: the murder trial , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: came on in the court. It became the absorbing topic of village talk immediately. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Tom could not get away from it. Every reference to the murder sent a shudder to , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: his heart, for his troubled conscience and fears almost persuaded him that these , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: suspected of knowing anything about the murder, but still he could not be , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: comfortable in the midst of this gossip. It kept him in a cold shiver all the time. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: He took Huck to a lonely place to have a talk with him. It would be some relief to , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: unseal his tongue for a little while; to divide his burden of distress with another , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: "Huck, they couldn't anybody get you to tell, could they?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Get me to tell? Why, if I wanted that halfbreed devil to drownd me they could , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: get me to tell. They ain't no different way." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Well, that's all right, then. I reckon we're safe as long as we keep mum. But , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: let's swear again, anyway. It's more surer." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I'm agreed." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: "That's just the same way they go on round me. I reckon he's a goner. Don't you , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: feel sorry for him, sometimes?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Most always—most always. He ain't no account; but then he hain't ever done , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: anything to hurt anybody. Just fishes a little, to get money to get drunk on—and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: loafs around considerable; but lord, we all do that—leastways most of us—, Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: preachers and such like. But he's kind of good—he give me half a fish, once, when , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: "Yes—so they would. But I hate to hear 'em abuse him so like the dickens when , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: "I do too, Tom. Lord, I hear 'em say he's the bloodiest looking villain in this , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: "And they'd do it, too." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: "By the oaths of citizens whose simple word is above suspicion, we have , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: A puzzled amazement awoke in every face in the house, not even excepting , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Potter's. Every eye fastened itself with wondering interest upon Tom as he rose , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: "Only a—a—dead cat." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: "We will produce the skeleton of that cat. Now, my boy, tell us everything that , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: Fight! Why, they used to fight all the time. I remember, mighty well." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "That ain't anything. The girl I'm going to marry won't fight." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Tom, I reckon they're all alike. They'll all comb a body. Now you better think , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: 'bout this awhile. I tell you you better. What's the name of the gal?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "It ain't a gal at all—it's a girl." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "It's all the same, I reckon; some says gal, some says girl—both's right, like , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: enough. Anyway, what's her name, Tom?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I'll tell you some time—not now." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "All right—that'll do. Only if you get married I'll be more lonesomer than ever." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "No you won't. You'll come and live with me. Now stir out of this and we'll go , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: to digging." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: They worked and sweated for half an hour. No result. They toiled another , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: halfhour. Still no result. Huck said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Do they always bury it as deep as this?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Sometimes—not always. Not generally. I reckon we haven't got the right place." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: So they chose a new spot and began again. The labor dragged a little, but still , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: they made progress. They pegged away in silence for some time. Finally Huck , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: leaned on his shovel, swabbed the beaded drops from his brow with his sleeve, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Where you going to dig next, after we get this one?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I reckon maybe we'll tackle the old tree that's over yonder on Cardiff Hill back , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: of the widow's." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I reckon that'll be a good one. But won't the widow take it away from us, Tom? , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: It's on her land." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "SHE take it away! Maybe she'd like to try it once. Whoever finds one of these , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: hid treasures, it belongs to him. It don't make any difference whose land it's on." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: That was satisfactory. The work went on. By and by Huck said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Blame it, we must be in the wrong place again. What do you think?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "It is mighty curious, Huck. I don't understand it. Sometimes witches interfere. I , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: reckon maybe that's what's the trouble now." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Shucks! Witches ain't got no power in the daytime." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Well, that's so. I didn't think of that. Oh, I know what the matter is! What a , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: blamed lot of fools we are! You got to find out where the shadow of the limb falls , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: at midnight, and that's where you dig!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Then consound it, we've fooled away all this work for nothing. Now hang it all, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: we got to come back in the night. It's an awful long way. Can you get out?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I bet I will. We've got to do it tonight, too, because if somebody sees these , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: holes they'll know in a minute what's here and they'll go for it." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Well, I'll come around and maow tonight." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "All right. Let's hide the tools in the bushes." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: The boys were there that night, about the appointed time. They sat in the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: shadow waiting. It was a lonely place, and an hour made solemn by old , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: traditions. Spirits whispered in the rustling leaves, ghosts lurked in the murky , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: nooks, the deep baying of a hound floated up out of the distance, an owl , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: answered with his sepulchral note. The boys were subdued by these solemnities, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and talked little. By and by they judged that twelve had come; they marked where , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the shadow fell, and began to dig. Their hopes commenced to rise. Their interest , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: grew stronger, and their industry kept pace with it. The hole deepened and still , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: deepened, but every time their hearts jumped to hear the pick strike upon , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: something, they only suffered a new disappointment. It was only a stone or a , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: chunk. At last Tom said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "It ain't any use, Huck, we're wrong again." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Well, but we CAN'T be wrong. We spotted the shadder to a dot." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I know it, but then there's another thing." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "What's that?". , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Why, we only guessed at the time. Like enough it was too late or too early." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Huck dropped his shovel. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "That's it," said he. "That's the very trouble. We got to give this one up. We can't , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: ever tell the right time, and besides this kind of thing's too awful, here this time of , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: night with witches and ghosts a-fluttering around so. I feel as if something's , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: behind me all the time;  and I'm afeard to turn around, becuz maybe there's others , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: in front a-waiting for a chance. I been creeping all over, ever since I got here." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Well, I've been pretty much so, too, Huck. They most always put in a dead man , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: when they bury a treasure under a tree, to look out for it." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Lordy!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Yes, they do. I've always heard that." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Tom, I don't like to fool around much where there's dead people. A body's , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: bound to get into trouble with 'em, sure." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I don't like to stir 'em up, either. S'pose this one here was to stick his skull out , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and say something!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Don't Tom! It's awful." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Well, it just is. Huck, I don't feel comfortable a bit." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Say, Tom, let's give this place up, and try somewheres else." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "All right, I reckon we better." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "What'll it be?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Tom considered awhile; and then said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "The ha'nted house. That's it!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Blame it, I don't like ha'nted houses, Tom. Why, they're a dern sight worse'n , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: dead people. Dead people might talk, maybe, but they don't come sliding around , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: in a shroud, when you ain't noticing, and peep over your shoulder all of a sudden , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and grit their teeth, the way a ghost does. I couldn't stand such a thing as that, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Tom—nobody could." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Yes, but, Huck, ghosts don't travel around only at night. They won't hender us , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: from digging there in the daytime." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Well, that's so. But you know mighty well people don't go about that ha'nted , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: house in the day nor the night." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Well, that's mostly because they don't like to go where a man's been murdered, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: anyway—but nothing's ever been seen around that house except in the night—just , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: some blue lights slipping by the windows—no regular ghosts." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Well, where you see one of them blue lights flickering around, Tom, you can , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: bet there's a ghost mighty close behind it. It stands to reason. Becuz you know , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: that they don't anybody but ghosts use 'em." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Yes, that's so. But anyway they don't come around in the daytime, so what's , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the use of our being afeard?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Well, all right. We'll tackle the ha'nted house if you say so—but I reckon it's , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: ABOUT noon the next day the boys arrived at the dead tree; they had come for , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: their tools. Tom was impatient to go to the haunted house; Huck was measurably , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: so, also—but suddenly said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Lookyhere, Tom, do you know what day it is?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Tom mentally ran over the days of the week, and then quickly lifted his eyes , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: with a startled look in them— , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "My! I never once thought of it, Huck!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Well, I didn't neither, but all at once it popped onto me that it was Friday." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Blame it, a body can't be too careful, Huck. We might 'a' got into an awful , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: scrape, tackling such a thing on a Friday." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "MIGHT! Better say we WOULD! There's some lucky days, maybe, but Friday , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: ain't." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Any fool knows that. I don't reckon YOU was the first that found it out, Huck." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Well, I never said I was, did I? And Friday ain't all, neither. I had a rotten bad , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: dream last night—dreampt about rats." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "No! Sure sign of trouble. Did they fight?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "No." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Well, that's good, Huck. When they don't fight it's only a sign that there's , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: trouble around, you know. All we got to do is to look mighty sharp and keep out , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: of it. We'll drop this thing for today, and play. Do you know Robin Hood, Huck?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "No. Who's Robin Hood?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Why, he was one of the greatest men that was ever in England—and the best. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: He was a robber." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Cracky, I wisht I was. Who did he rob?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Only sheriffs and bishops and rich people and kings, and such like. But he , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: never bothered the poor. He loved 'em. He always divided up with 'em perfectly , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: square." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Well, he must 'a' been a brick." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I bet you he was, Huck. Oh, he was the noblest man that ever was. They ain't , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: any such men now, I can tell you. He could lick any man in England, with one , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: hand tied behind him; and he could take his yew bow and plug a ten-cent piece , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: every time, a mile and a half." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "What's a YEW bow?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I don't know. It's some kind of a bow, of course. And if he hit that dime only , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: on the edge he would set down and cry—and curse. But we'll play Robin Hood—, Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: it's nobby fun. I'll learn you." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I'm agreed." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: So they played Robin Hood all the afternoon, now and then casting a yearning , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: eye down upon the haunted house and passing a remark about the morrow's , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: prospects and possibilities there. As the sun began to sink into the west they took , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: their way homeward athwart the long shadows of the trees and soon were buried , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: from sight in the forests of Cardiff Hill. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: On Saturday, shortly after noon, the boys were at the dead tree again. They had , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: a smoke and a chat in the shade, and then dug a little in their last hole, not with , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: great hope, but merely because Tom said there were so many cases where people , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: had given up a treasure after getting down within six inches of it, and then , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: somebody else had come along and turned it up with a single thrust of a shovel. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: The thing failed this time, however, so the boys shouldered their tools and went , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: away feeling that they had not trifled with fortune, but had fulfilled all the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: requirements that belong to the business of treasure-hunting. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: When they reached the haunted house there was something so weird and grisly , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: about the dead silence that reigned there under the baking sun, and something so , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: depressing about the loneliness and desolation of the place, that they were afraid, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: for a moment, to venture in. Then they crept to the door and took a trembling , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: peep. They saw a weedgrown, floorless room, unplastered, an ancient fireplace, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: vacant windows, a ruinous staircase; and here, there, and everywhere hung , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: ragged and abandoned cobwebs. They presently entered, softly, with quickened , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: pulses, talking in whispers, ears alert to catch the slightest sound, and muscles , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: tense and ready for instant retreat. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: In a little while familiarity modified their fears and they gave the place a critical , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and interested examination, rather admiring their own boldness, and wondering at , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: it, too. Next they wanted to look upstairs. This was something like cutting off , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: retreat, but they got to daring each other, and of course there could be but one , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: result—they threw their tools into a corner and made the ascent. Up there were , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the same signs of decay. In one corner they found a closet that promised mystery, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: but the promise was a fraud—there was nothing in it. Their courage was up now , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and well in hand. They were about to go down and begin work when— , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Sh!" said Tom. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "What is it?" whispered Huck, blanching with fright. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Sh!... There!... Hear it?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Yes!... Oh, my! Let's run!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Keep still! Don't you budge! They're coming right toward the door." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: The boys stretched themselves upon the floor with their eyes to knotholes in the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: planking, and lay waiting, in a misery of fear. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "They've stopped.... No—coming.... Here they are. Don't whisper another word, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Huck. My goodness, I wish I was out of this!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Two men entered. Each boy said to himself: "There's the old deaf and dumb , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Spaniard that's been about town once or twice lately—never saw t'other man , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: before." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "T'other" was a ragged, unkempt creature, with nothing very pleasant in his , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: face. The Spaniard was wrapped in a serape; he had bushy white whiskers; long , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: white hair flowed from under his sombrero, and he wore green goggles. When they , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: came in, "t'other" was talking in a low voice; they sat down on the ground, facing , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the door, with their backs to the wall, and the speaker continued his remarks. His , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: manner became less guarded and his words more distinct as he proceeded: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "No," said he, "I've thought it all over, and I don't like it. It's dangerous." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Dangerous!" grunted the "deaf and dumb" Spaniard—to the vast surprise of the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: boys. "Milksop!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: This voice made the boys gasp and quake. It was Injun Joe's! There was silence , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: for some time. Then Joe said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "What's any more dangerous than that job up yonder—but nothing's come of it." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "That's different. Away up the river so, and not another house about. 'Twon't , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: ever be known that we tried, anyway, long as we didn't succeed." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Well, what's more dangerous than coming here in the daytime!—anybody , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: would suspicion us that saw us." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I know that. But there warn't any other place as handy after that fool of a job. I , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: want to quit this shanty. I wanted to yesterday, only it warn't any use trying to , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: stir out of here, with those infernal boys playing over there on the hill right in full , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: view." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Those infernal boys" quaked again under the inspiration of this remark, and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: thought how lucky it was that they had remembered it was Friday and concluded , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: to wait a day. They wished in their hearts they had waited a year. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: The two men got out some food and made a luncheon. After a long and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: thoughtful silence, Injun Joe said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Look here, lad—you go back up the river where you belong. Wait there till you , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: hear from me. I'll take the chances on dropping into this town just once more, for , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: a look. We'll do that 'dangerous' job after I've spied around a little and think , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: things look well for it. Then for Texas! We'll leg it together!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: This was satisfactory. Both men presently fell to yawning, and Injun Joe said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: once or twice and he became quiet. Presently the watcher began to nod; his head , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: drooped lower and lower, both men began to snore now. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: The boys drew a long, grateful breath. Tom whispered: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Now's our chance—come!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Huck said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I can't—I'd die if they was to wake." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Tom urged—Huck held back. At last Tom rose slowly and softly, and started , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: alone. But the first step he made wrung such a hideous creak from the crazy floor , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: that he sank down almost dead with fright. He never made a second attempt. The , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: boys lay there counting the dragging moments till it seemed to them that time , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: must be done and eternity growing gray; and then they were grateful to note that , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: at last the sun was setting. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Now one snore ceased. Injun Joe sat up, stared around—smiled grimly upon his , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: comrade, whose head was drooping upon his knees—stirred him up with his foot , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Here! YOU'RE a watchman, ain't you! All right, though—nothing's happened." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "My! have I been asleep?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Oh, partly, partly. Nearly time for us to be moving, pard. What'll we do with , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: what little swag we've got left?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I don't know—leave it here as we've always done, I reckon. No use to take it , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: away till we start south. Six hundred and fifty in silver's something to carry." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Well—all right—it won't matter to come here once more." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "No—but I'd say come in the night as we used to do—it's better." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Yes: but look here; it may be a good while before I get the right chance at that , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: job; accidents might happen; 'tain't in such a very good place; we'll just regularly , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: bury it—and bury it deep." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Good idea," said the comrade, who walked across the room, knelt down, raised , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: one of the rearward hearth-stones and took out a bag that jingled pleasantly. He , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: subtracted from it twenty or thirty dollars for himself and as much for Injun Joe, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and passed the bag to the latter, who was on his knees in the corner, now, digging , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: with his bowie-knife. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: The boys forgot all their fears, all their miseries in an instant. With gloating , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: eyes they watched every movement. Luck!—the splendor of it was beyond all , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: imagination! Six hundred dollars was money enough to make half a dozen boys , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: rich! Here was treasure-hunting under the happiest auspices—there would not be , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: any bothersome uncertainty as to where to dig. They nudged each other every , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: moment—eloquent nudges and easily understood, for they simply meant—"Oh, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: but ain't you glad NOW we're here!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Joe's knife struck upon something. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Hello!" said he. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "What is it?" said his comrade. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Half-rotten plank—no, it's a box, I believe. Here—bear a hand and we'll see , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: what it's here for. Never mind, I've broke a hole." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: He reached his hand in and drew it out— , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Man, it's money!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: The two men examined the handful of coins. They were gold. The boys above , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: were as excited as themselves, and as delighted. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Joe's comrade said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "We'll make quick work of this. There's an old rusty pick over amongst the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: weeds in the corner the other side of the fireplace—I saw it a minute ago." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: He ran and brought the boys' pick and shovel. Injun Joe took the pick, looked it , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: over critically, shook his head, muttered something to himself, and then began to , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: use it. The box was soon unearthed. It was not very large; it was iron bound and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: had been very strong before the slow years had injured it. The men contemplated , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the treasure awhile in blissful silence. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Pard, there's thousands of dollars here," said Injun Joe. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "'Twas always said that Murrel's gang used to be around here one summer," the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: stranger observed. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I know it," said Injun Joe; "and this looks like it, I should say." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Now you won't need to do that job." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: The halfbreed frowned. Said he: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "You don't know me. Least you don't know all about that thing. 'Tain't robbery , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: altogether—it's REVENGE!" and a wicked light flamed in his eyes. "I'll need your , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: help in it. When it's finished—then Texas. Go home to your Nance and your kids, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and stand by till you hear from me." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Well—if you say so; what'll we do with this—bury it again?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Yes. [Ravishing delight overhead.] NO! by the great Sachem, no! [Profound , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: distress overhead.] I'd nearly forgot. That pick had fresh earth on it! [The boys , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: were sick with terror in a moment.] What business has a pick and a shovel here? , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: What business with fresh earth on them? Who brought them here—and where are , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: they gone? Have you heard anybody?—seen anybody? What! bury it again and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: leave them to come and see the ground disturbed? Not exactly—not exactly. We'll , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: take it to my den." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Why, of course! Might have thought of that before. You mean Number One?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "No—Number Two—under the cross. The other place is bad—too common." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "All right. It's nearly dark enough to start." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Injun Joe got up and went about from window to window cautiously peeping , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: out. Presently he said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Who could have brought those tools here? Do you reckon they can be , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: upstairs?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: The boys' breath forsook them. Injun Joe put his hand on his knife, halted a , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: moment, undecided, and then turned toward the stairway. The boys thought of , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the closet, but their strength was gone. The steps came creaking up the stairs—the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: intolerable distress of the situation woke the stricken resolution of the lads—they , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: were about to spring for the closet, when there was a crash of rotten timbers and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Injun Joe landed on the ground amid the debris of the ruined stairway. He , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: gathered himself up cursing, and his comrade said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Now what's the use of all that? If it's anybody, and they're up there, let them , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: STAY there—who cares? If they want to jump down, now, and get into trouble, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: who objects? It will be dark in fifteen minutes—and then let them follow us if , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: they want to. I'm willing. In my opinion, whoever hove those things in here , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: caught a sight of us and took us for ghosts or devils or something. I'll bet they're , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: running yet." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Joe grumbled awhile; then he agreed with his friend that what daylight was left , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: ought to be economized in getting things ready for leaving. Shortly afterward they , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: slipped out of the house in the deepening twilight, and moved toward the river , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: with their precious box. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Tom and Huck rose up, weak but vastly relieved, and stared after them through , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the chinks between the logs of the house. Follow? Not they. They were content to , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: reach ground again without broken necks, and take the townward track over the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: hill. They did not talk much. They were too much absorbed in hating , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: themselves—hating the ill luck that made them take the spade and the pick there. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: But for that, Injun Joe never would have suspected. He would have hidden the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: silver with the gold to wait there till his "revenge" was satisfied, and then he , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: would have had the misfortune to find that money turn up missing. Bitter, bitter , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: luck that the tools were ever brought there! , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: They resolved to keep a lookout for that Spaniard when he should come to town , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: spying out for chances to do his revengeful job, and follow him to "Number Two," , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: wherever that might be. Then a ghastly thought occurred to Tom. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Revenge? What if he means US, Huck!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Oh, don't!" said Huck, nearly fainting. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: They talked it all over, and as they entered town they agreed to believe that he , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: might possibly mean somebody else—at least that he might at least mean nobody , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: but Tom, since only Tom had testified. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Very, very small comfort it was to Tom to be alone in danger! Company would , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: CHAPTER XXVII , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Bold, Size: 18.0
Text: THE adventure of the day mightily tormented Tom's dreams that night. Four , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: times he had his hands on that rich treasure and four times it wasted to , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: nothingness in his fingers as sleep forsook him and wakefulness brought back the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: hard reality of his misfortune. As he lay in the early morning recalling the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: incidents of his great adventure, he noticed that they seemed curiously subdued , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and far away—somewhat as if they had happened in another world, or in a time , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: long gone by. Then it occurred to him that the great adventure itself must be a , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: dream! There was one very strong argument in favor of this idea—namely, that , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the quantity of coin he had seen was too vast to be real. He had never seen as , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: much as fifty dollars in one mass before, and he was like all boys of his age and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: station in life, in that he imagined that all references to "hundreds" and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "thousands" were mere fanciful forms of speech, and that no such sums really , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: existed in the world. He never had supposed for a moment that so large a sum as , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: a hundred dollars was to be found in actual money in any one's possession. If his , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: notions of hidden treasure had been analyzed, they would have been found to , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: consist of a handful of real dimes and a bushel of vague, splendid, ungraspable , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: dollars. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: But the incidents of his adventure grew sensibly sharper and clearer under the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: attrition of thinking them over, and so he presently found himself leaning to the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: impression that the thing might not have been a dream, after all. This uncertainty , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: must be swept away. He would snatch a hurried breakfast and go and find Huck. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Huck was sitting on the gunwale of a flatboat, listlessly dangling his feet in the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: water and looking very melancholy. Tom concluded to let Huck lead up to the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: subject. If he did not do it, then the adventure would be proved to have been only , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: a dream. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Hello, Huck!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: "Number Two—yes, that's it. I been thinking 'bout that. But I can't make , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: "Goody!... No, Tom, that ain't it. If it is, it ain't in this one-horse town. They , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: "Well, that's so. Lemme think a minute. Here—it's the number of a room—in a , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: Tom was off at once. He did not care to have Huck's company in public places. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: He was gone half an hour. He found that in the best tavern, No. 2 had long been , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: occupied by a young lawyer, and was still so occupied. In the less ostentatious , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: house, No. 2 was a mystery. The tavern-keeper's young son said it was kept , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: locked all the time, and he never saw anybody go into it or come out of it except , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: at night; he did not know any particular reason for this state of things; had had , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: some little curiosity, but it was rather feeble; had made the most of the mystery , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: by entertaining himself with the idea that that room was "ha'nted"; had noticed , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: that there was a light in there the night before. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "That's what I've found out, Huck. I reckon that's the very No. 2 we're after." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I reckon it is, Tom. Now what you going to do?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Lemme think." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Tom thought a long time. Then he said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I'll tell you. The back door of that No. 2 is the door that comes out into that , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: little close alley between the tavern and the old rattle trap of a brick store. Now , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: you get hold of all the doorkeys you can find, and I'll nip all of auntie's, and the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: Joe, because he said he was going to drop into town and spy around once more for , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: to that No. 2, that ain't the place." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Lordy, I don't want to foller him by myself!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: never think anything." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Well, if it's pretty dark I reckon I'll track him. I dono—I dono. I'll try." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "You bet I'll follow him, if it's dark, Huck. Why, he might 'a' found out he , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: CHAPTER XXVIII , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Bold, Size: 18.0
Text: THAT night Tom and Huck were ready for their adventure. They hung about , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the neighborhood of the tavern until after nine, one watching the alley at a , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: distance and the other the tavern door. Nobody entered the alley or left it; nobody , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: resembling the Spaniard entered or left the tavern door. The night promised to be , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: a fair one; so Tom went home with the understanding that if a considerable , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: degree of darkness came on, Huck was to come and "maow," whereupon he would , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: slip out and try the keys. But the night remained clear, and Huck closed his watch , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and retired to bed in an empty sugar hogshead about twelve. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Tuesday the boys had the same ill luck. Also Wednesday. But Thursday night , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: promised better. Tom slipped out in good season with his aunt's old tin lantern, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and a large towel to blindfold it with. He hid the lantern in Huck's sugar hogshead , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and the watch began. An hour before midnight the tavern closed up and its lights , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: (the only ones thereabouts) were put out. No Spaniard had been seen. Nobody , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: had entered or left the alley. Everything was auspicious. The blackness of , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: darkness reigned, the perfect stillness was interrupted only by occasional , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: mutterings of distant thunder. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Tom got his lantern, lit it in the hogshead, wrapped it closely in the towel, and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the two adventurers crept in the gloom toward the tavern. Huck stood sentry and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Tom felt his way into the alley. Then there was a season of waiting anxiety that , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: weighed upon Huck's spirits like a mountain. He began to wish he could see a , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: flash from the lantern—it would frighten him, but it would at least tell him that , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Tom was alive yet. It seemed hours since Tom had disappeared. Surely he must , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: have fainted; maybe he was dead; maybe his heart had burst under terror and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: excitement. In his uneasiness Huck found himself drawing closer and closer to the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: alley; fearing all sorts of dreadful things, and momentarily expecting some , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: catastrophe to happen that would take away his breath. There was not much to , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: take away, for he seemed only able to inhale it by thimblefuls, and his heart , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: would soon wear itself out, the way it was beating. Suddenly there was a flash of , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: light and Tom came tearing by him: "Run!" said he; "run, for your life!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: He needn't have repeated it; once was enough; Huck was making thirty or forty , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: miles an hour before the repetition was uttered. The boys never stopped till they , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: reached the shed of a deserted slaughter-house at the lower end of the village. Just , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: as they got within its shelter the storm burst and the rain poured down. As soon , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: as Tom got his breath he said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Huck, it was awful! I tried two of the keys, just as soft as I could; but they , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: seemed to make such a power of racket that I couldn't hardly get my breath I was , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: so scared. They wouldn't turn in the lock, either. Well, without noticing what I , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: was doing, I took hold of the knob, and open comes the door! It warn't locked! I , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: hopped in, and shook off the towel, and, GREAT CAESAR'S GHOST!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "What!—what'd you see, Tom?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Huck, I most stepped onto Injun Joe's hand!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "No!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Yes! He was lying there, sound asleep on the floor, with his old patch on his , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: eye and his arms spread out." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Lordy, what did you do? Did he wake up?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "No, never budged. Drunk, I reckon. I just grabbed that towel and started!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I'd never 'a' thought of the towel, I bet!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Well, I would. My aunt would make me mighty sick if I lost it." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Say, Tom, did you see that box?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Huck, I didn't wait to look around. I didn't see the box, I didn't see the cross. I , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: didn't see anything but a bottle and a tin cup on the floor by Injun Joe; yes, I saw , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: two barrels and lots more bottles in the room. Don't you see, now, what's the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: matter with that ha'nted room?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "How?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Why, it's ha'nted with whiskey! Maybe ALL the Temperance Taverns have got a , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: ha'nted room, hey, Huck?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Well, I reckon maybe that's so. Who'd 'a' thought such a thing? But say, Tom, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: now's a mighty good time to get that box, if Injun Joe's drunk." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "It is, that! You try it!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Huck shuddered. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Well, no—I reckon not." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "And I reckon not, Huck. Only one bottle alongside of Injun Joe ain't enough. If , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: there'd been three, he'd be drunk enough and I'd do it." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: There was a long pause for reflection, and then Tom said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Lookyhere, Huck, less not try that thing any more till we know Injun Joe's not , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: in there. It's too scary. Now, if we watch every night, we'll be dead sure to see , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: him go out, some time or other, and then we'll snatch that box quicker'n , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: lightning." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Well, I'm agreed. I'll watch the whole night long, and I'll do it every night, too, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: if you'll do the other part of the job." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "All right, I will. All you got to do is to trot up Hooper Street a block and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: maow—and if I'm asleep, you throw some gravel at the window and that'll fetch , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: me." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Agreed, and good as wheat!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Now, Huck, the storm's over, and I'll go home. It'll begin to be daylight in a , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: couple of hours. You go back and watch that long, will you?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I said I would, Tom, and I will. I'll ha'nt that tavern every night for a year! I'll , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: sleep all day and I'll stand watch all night." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "That's all right. Now, where you going to sleep?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "In Ben Rogers' hayloft. He lets me, and so does his pap's nigger man, Uncle , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Jake. I tote water for Uncle Jake whenever he wants me to, and any time I ask , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: him he gives me a little something to eat if he can spare it. That's a mighty good , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: nigger, Tom. He likes me, becuz I don't ever act as if I was above him. Sometime , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: I've set right down and eat WITH him. But you needn't tell that. A body's got to , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: do things when he's awful hungry he wouldn't want to do as a steady thing." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Well, if I don't want you in the daytime, I'll let you sleep. I won't come , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: bothering around. Any time you see something's up, in the night, just skip right , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: THE first thing Tom heard on Friday morning was a glad piece of news—Judge , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Thatcher's family had come back to town the night before. Both Injun Joe and the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: treasure sunk into secondary importance for a moment, and Becky took the chief , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: place in the boy's interest. He saw her and they had an exhausting good time , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: playing "hispy" and "gully-keeper" with a crowd of their schoolmates. The day was , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: completed and crowned in a peculiarly satisfactory way: Becky teased her mother , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: to appoint the next day for the long-promised and long-delayed picnic, and she , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: consented. The child's delight was boundless; and Tom's not more moderate. The , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: invitations were sent out before sunset, and straightway the young folks of the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: village were thrown into a fever of preparation and pleasurable anticipation. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Tom's excitement enabled him to keep awake until a pretty late hour, and he had , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: good hopes of hearing Huck's "maow," and of having his treasure to astonish , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Becky and the picnickers with, next day; but he was disappointed. No signal came , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: that night. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Morning came, eventually, and by ten or eleven o'clock a giddy and rollicking , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: company were gathered at Judge Thatcher's, and everything was ready for a start. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: It was not the custom for elderly people to mar the picnics with their presence. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: The children were considered safe enough under the wings of a few young ladies , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: of eighteen and a few young gentlemen of twenty-three or thereabouts. The old , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: steam ferry-boat was chartered for the occasion; presently the gay throng filed up , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the main street laden with provision-baskets. Sid was sick and had to miss the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: fun; Mary remained at home to entertain him. The last thing Mrs. Thatcher said , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: to Becky, was: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "You'll not get back till late. Perhaps you'd better stay all night with some of the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: girls that live near the ferry-landing, child." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Then I'll stay with Susy Harper, mamma." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Very well. And mind and behave yourself and don't be any trouble." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Presently, as they tripped along, Tom said to Becky: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Say—I'll tell you what we'll do. 'Stead of going to Joe Harper's we'll climb right , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: up the hill and stop at the Widow Douglas'. She'll have ice-cream! She has it most , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: every day—dead loads of it. And she'll be awful glad to have us." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Oh, that will be fun!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Then Becky reflected a moment and said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "But what will mamma say?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "How'll she ever know?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: The girl turned the idea over in her mind, and said reluctantly: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I reckon it's wrong—but—" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "But shucks! Your mother won't know, and so what's the harm? All she wants is , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: that you'll be safe; and I bet you she'd 'a' said go there if she'd 'a' thought of it. I , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: know she would!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: The Widow Douglas' splendid hospitality was a tempting bait. It and Tom's , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: persuasions presently carried the day. So it was decided to say nothing anybody , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: about the night's programme. Presently it occurred to Tom that maybe Huck might , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: come this very night and give the signal. The thought took a deal of the spirit out , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: of his anticipations. Still he could not bear to give up the fun at Widow Douglas'. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: And why should he give it up, he reasoned—the signal did not come the night , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: before, so why should it be any more likely to come tonight? The sure fun of the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: evening outweighed the uncertain treasure; and, boy-like, he determined to yield , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: to the stronger inclination and not allow himself to think of the box of money , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: another time that day. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Three miles below town the ferryboat stopped at the mouth of a woody hollow , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and tied up. The crowd swarmed ashore and soon the forest distances and craggy , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: heights echoed far and near with shoutings and laughter. All the different ways of , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: getting hot and tired were gone through with, and by-and-by the rovers straggled , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: back to camp fortified with responsible appetites, and then the destruction of the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: good things began. After the feast there was a refreshing season of rest and chat , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: in the shade of spreading oaks. By-and-by somebody shouted: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Who's ready for the cave?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Everybody was. Bundles of candles were procured, and straightway there was a , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: general scamper up the hill. The mouth of the cave was up the hillside—an , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: opening shaped like a letter A. Its massive oaken door stood unbarred. Within was , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: a small chamber, chilly as an icehouse, and walled by Nature with solid limestone , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: that was dewy with a cold sweat. It was romantic and mysterious to stand here in , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the deep gloom and look out upon the green valley shining in the sun. But the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: impressiveness of the situation quickly wore off, and the romping began again. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: The moment a candle was lighted there was a general rush upon the owner of it; a , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: struggle and a gallant defence followed, but the candle was soon knocked down or , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: blown out, and then there was a glad clamor of laughter and a new chase. But all , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: things have an end. By-and-by the procession went filing down the steep descent , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: of the main avenue, the flickering rank of lights dimly revealing the lofty walls of , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: rock almost to their point of junction sixty feet overhead. This main avenue was , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: not more than eight or ten feet wide. Every few steps other lofty and still , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: narrower crevices branched from it on either hand—for McDougal's cave was but , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: a vast labyrinth of crooked aisles that ran into each other and out again and led , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: nowhere. It was said that one might wander days and nights together through its , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: intricate tangle of rifts and chasms, and never find the end of the cave; and that , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: he might go down, and down, and still down, into the earth, and it was just the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: same—labyrinth under labyrinth, and no end to any of them. No man "knew" the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: cave. That was an impossible thing. Most of the young men knew a portion of it, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and it was not customary to venture much beyond this known portion. Tom , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Sawyer knew as much of the cave as any one. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: The procession moved along the main avenue some three-quarters of a mile, and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: then groups and couples began to slip aside into branch avenues, fly along the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: dismal corridors, and take each other by surprise at points where the corridors , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: joined again. Parties were able to elude each other for the space of half an hour , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: without going beyond the "known" ground. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: By-and-by, one group after another came straggling back to the mouth of the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: cave, panting, hilarious, smeared from head to foot with tallow drippings, daubed , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: with clay, and entirely delighted with the success of the day. Then they were , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: astonished to find that they had been taking no note of time and that night was , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: about at hand. The clanging bell had been calling for half an hour. However, this , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: sort of close to the day's adventures was romantic and therefore satisfactory. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: When the ferryboat with her wild freight pushed into the stream, nobody cared , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: sixpence for the wasted time but the captain of the craft. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Huck was already upon his watch when the ferryboat's lights went glinting past , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the wharf. He heard no noise on board, for the young people were as subdued and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: still as people usually are who are nearly tired to death. He wondered what boat it , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: was, and why she did not stop at the wharf—and then he dropped her out of his , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: mind and put his attention upon his business. The night was growing cloudy and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: dark. Ten o'clock came, and the noise of vehicles ceased, scattered lights began to , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: wink out, all straggling foot-passengers disappeared, the village betook itself to its , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: slumbers and left the small watcher alone with the silence and the ghosts. Eleven , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: o'clock came, and the tavern lights were put out; darkness everywhere, now. Huck , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: waited what seemed a weary long time, but nothing happened. His faith was , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: weakening. Was there any use? Was there really any use? Why not give it up and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: turn in? , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: A noise fell upon his ear. He was all attention in an instant. The alley door , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: closed softly. He sprang to the corner of the brick store. The next moment two , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: men brushed by him, and one seemed to have something under his arm. It must , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: be that box! So they were going to remove the treasure. Why call Tom now? It , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: would be absurd—the men would get away with the box and never be found , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: again. No, he would stick to their wake and follow them; he would trust to the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: darkness for security from discovery. So communing with himself, Huck stepped , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: out and glided along behind the men, cat-like, with bare feet, allowing them to , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: keep just far enough ahead not to be invisible. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: They moved up the river street three blocks, then turned to the left up a , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: crossstreet. They went straight ahead, then, until they came to the path that led , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: up Cardiff Hill; this they took. They passed by the old Welshman's house, halfway , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: up the hill, without hesitating, and still climbed upward. Good, thought Huck, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: they will bury it in the old quarry. But they never stopped at the quarry. They , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: passed on, up the summit. They plunged into the narrow path between the tall , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: sumach bushes, and were at once hidden in the gloom. Huck closed up and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: Very well, he thought, let them bury it there; it won't be hard to find. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Now there was a voice—a very low voice—Injun Joe's: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Damn her, maybe she's got company—there's lights, late as it is." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I can't see any." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: This was that stranger's voice—the stranger of the haunted house. A deadly chill , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: went to Huck's heart—this, then, was the "revenge" job! His thought was, to fly. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Then he remembered that the Widow Douglas had been kind to him more than , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: "Because the bush is in your way. Now—this way—now you see, don't you?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: Huck felt that a silence was going to ensue—a thing still more awful than any , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: planted his foot carefully and firmly, after balancing, one-legged, in a precarious , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: way and almost toppling over, first on one side and then on the other. He took , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: another step back, with the same elaboration and the same risks; then another , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and another, and—a twig snapped under his foot! His breath stopped and he , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: listened. There was no sound—the stillness was perfect. His gratitude was , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: measureless. Now he turned in his tracks, between the walls of sumach bushes—, Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: turned himself as carefully as if he were a ship—and then stepped quickly but , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: cautiously along. When he emerged at the quarry he felt secure, and so he picked , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: up his nimble heels and flew. Down, down he sped, till he reached the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Welshman's. He banged at the door, and presently the heads of the old man and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: his two stalwart sons were thrust from windows. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: "Please don't—I'd be killed, sure—but the widow's been good friends to me , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: Three minutes later the old man and his sons, well armed, were up the hill, and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: just entering the sumach path on tiptoe, their weapons in their hands. Huck , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: CHAPTER XXX , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Bold, Size: 18.0
Text: AS the earliest suspicion of dawn appeared on Sunday morning, Huck came , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: groping up the hill and rapped gently at the old Welshman's door. The inmates , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: were asleep, but it was a sleep that was set on a hair-trigger, on account of the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: exciting episode of the night. A call came from a window: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Who's there!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Huck's scared voice answered in a low tone: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Please let me in! It's only Huck Finn!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "It's a name that can open this door night or day, lad!—and welcome!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: These were strange words to the vagabond boy's ears, and the pleasantest he , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: had ever heard. He could not recollect that the closing word had ever been , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: applied in his case before. The door was quickly unlocked, and he entered. Huck , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: was given a seat and the old man and his brace of tall sons speedily dressed , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: themselves. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Now, my boy, I hope you're good and hungry, because breakfast will be ready , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: as soon as the sun's up, and we'll have a piping hot one, too—make yourself easy , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: about that! I and the boys hoped you'd turn up and stop here last night." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I was awful scared," said Huck, "and I run. I took out when the pistols went , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: off, and I didn't stop for three mile. I've come now becuz I wanted to know about , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: it, you know; and I come before daylight becuz I didn't want to run across them , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: devils, even if they was dead." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Well, poor chap, you do look as if you'd had a hard night of it—but there's a , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: bed here for you when you've had your breakfast. No, they ain't dead, lad—we are , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: sorry enough for that. You see we knew right where to put our hands on them, by , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: your description; so we crept along on tiptoe till we got within fifteen feet of , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: them—dark as a cellar that sumach path was—and just then I found I was going , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: to sneeze. It was the meanest kind of luck! I tried to keep it back, but no use—, Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: 'twas bound to come, and it did come! I was in the lead with my pistol raised, and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: when the sneeze started those scoundrels a-rustling to get out of the path, I sung , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: out, 'Fire boys!' and blazed away at the place where the rustling was. So did the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: boys. But they were off in a jiffy, those villains, and we after them, down through , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the woods. I judge we never touched them. They fired a shot apiece as they , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: started, but their bullets whizzed by and didn't do us any harm. As soon as we , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: lost the sound of their feet we quit chasing, and went down and stirred up the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: constables. They got a posse together, and went off to guard the river bank, and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: as soon as it is light the sheriff and a gang are going to beat up the woods. My , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: boys will be with them presently. I wish we had some sort of description of those , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: rascals—'twould help a good deal. But you couldn't see what they were like, in the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: dark, lad, I suppose?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Oh yes; I saw them downtown and follered them." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Splendid! Describe them—describe them, my boy!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "One's the old deaf and dumb Spaniard that's ben around here once or twice, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and t'other's a mean-looking, ragged—" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "That's enough, lad, we know the men! Happened on them in the woods back of , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the widow's one day, and they slunk away. Off with you, boys, and tell the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: sheriff—get your breakfast tomorrow morning!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: The Welshman's sons departed at once. As they were leaving the room Huck , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: sprang up and exclaimed: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Oh, please don't tell ANYbody it was me that blowed on them! Oh, please!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "All right if you say it, Huck, but you ought to have the credit of what you did." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Oh no, no! Please don't tell!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: When the young men were gone, the old Welshman said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "They won't tell—and I won't. But why don't you want it known?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Huck would not explain, further than to say that he already knew too much , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: about one of those men and would not have the man know that he knew anything , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: against him for the whole world—he would be killed for knowing it, sure. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: The old man promised secrecy once more, and said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "How did you come to follow these fellows, lad? Were they looking suspicious?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Huck was silent while he framed a duly cautious reply. Then he said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Well, you see, I'm a kind of a hard lot,—least everybody says so, and I don't , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: see nothing agin it—and sometimes I can't sleep much, on account of thinking , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: about it and sort of trying to strike out a new way of doing. That was the way of , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: it last night. I couldn't sleep, and so I come along upstreet 'bout midnight, a-, Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: turning it all over, and when I got to that old shackly brick store by the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Temperance Tavern, I backed up agin the wall to have another think. Well, just , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: then along comes these two chaps slipping along close by me, with something , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: under their arm, and I reckoned they'd stole it. One was a-smoking, and t'other , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: one wanted a light; so they stopped right before me and the cigars lit up their , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: faces and I see that the big one was the deaf and dumb Spaniard, by his white , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: whiskers and the patch on his eye, and t'other one was a rusty, ragged-looking , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: devil." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Could you see the rags by the light of the cigars?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: This staggered Huck for a moment. Then he said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Well, I don't know—but somehow it seems as if I did." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Then they went on, and you—" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Follered 'em—yes. That was it. I wanted to see what was up—they sneaked , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: along so. I dogged 'em to the widder's stile, and stood in the dark and heard the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: ragged one beg for the widder, and the Spaniard swear he'd spile her looks just as , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: I told you and your two—" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "What! The DEAF AND DUMB man said all that!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Huck had made another terrible mistake! He was trying his best to keep the old , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: man from getting the faintest hint of who the Spaniard might be, and yet his , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: tongue seemed determined to get him into trouble in spite of all he could do. He , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: made several efforts to creep out of his scrape, but the old man's eye was upon , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: him and he made blunder after blunder. Presently the Welshman said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "My boy, don't be afraid of me. I wouldn't hurt a hair of your head for all the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: world. No—I'd protect you—I'd protect you. This Spaniard is not deaf and dumb; , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: you've let that slip without intending it; you can't cover that up now. You know , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: something about that Spaniard that you want to keep dark. Now trust me—tell me , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: what it is, and trust me—I won't betray you." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Huck looked into the old man's honest eyes a moment, then bent over and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: whispered in his ear: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "'Tain't a Spaniard—it's Injun Joe!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: The Welshman almost jumped out of his chair. In a moment he said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "It's all plain enough, now. When you talked about notching ears and slitting , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: noses I judged that that was your own embellishment, because white men don't , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: take that sort of revenge. But an Injun! That's a different matter altogether." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: During breakfast the talk went on, and in the course of it the old man said that , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the last thing which he and his sons had done, before going to bed, was to get a , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: lantern and examine the stile and its vicinity for marks of blood. They found , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: none, but captured a bulky bundle of— , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Of WHAT?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: If the words had been lightning they could not have leaped with a more , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: stunning suddenness from Huck's blanched lips. His eyes were staring wide, now, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and his breath suspended—waiting for the answer. The Welshman started—stared , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: in return—three seconds—five seconds—ten—then replied: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Of burglar's tools. Why, what's the MATTER with you?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Huck sank back, panting gently, but deeply, unutterably grateful. The , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Welshman eyed him gravely, curiously—and presently said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Yes, burglar's tools. That appears to relieve you a good deal. But what did give , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: you that turn? What were YOU expecting we'd found?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Huck was in a close place—the inquiring eye was upon him—he would have , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: given anything for material for a plausible answer—nothing suggested itself—the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: inquiring eye was boring deeper and deeper—a senseless reply offered—there was , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: no time to weigh it, so at a venture he uttered it—feebly: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Sunday-school books, maybe." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Poor Huck was too distressed to smile, but the old man laughed loud and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: joyously, shook up the details of his anatomy from head to foot, and ended by , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: saying that such a laugh was money in a-man's pocket, because it cut down the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: doctor's bill like everything. Then he added: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Poor old chap, you're white and jaded—you ain't well a bit—no wonder you're , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: a little flighty and off your balance. But you'll come out of it. Rest and sleep will , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: fetch you out all right, I hope." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Huck was irritated to think he had been such a goose and betrayed such a , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: suspicious excitement, for he had dropped the idea that the parcel brought from , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the tavern was the treasure, as soon as he had heard the talk at the widow's stile. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: He had only thought it was not the treasure, however—he had not known that it , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: wasn't—and so the suggestion of a captured bundle was too much for his self-, Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: for a hiding-place, for he had no mind to be connected even remotely with the late , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: event. The Welshman admitted several ladies and gentlemen, among them the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Widow Douglas, and noticed that groups of citizens were climbing up the hill—to , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: stare at the stile. So the news had spread. The Welshman had to tell the story of , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the night to the visitors. The widow's gratitude for her preservation was , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: outspoken. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Don't say a word about it, madam. There's another that you're more beholden , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: to than you are to me and my boys, maybe, but he don't allow me to tell his , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: Of course this excited a curiosity so vast that it almost belittled the main , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: through them be transmitted to the whole town, for he refused to part with his , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: secret. When all else had been learned, the widow said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I went to sleep reading in bed and slept straight through all that noise. Why , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: didn't you come and wake me?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "We judged it warn't worth while. Those fellows warn't likely to come again—, Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: they hadn't any tools left to work with, and what was the use of waking you up , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and scaring you to death? My three negro men stood guard at your house all the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: rest of the night. They've just come back." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: More visitors came, and the story had to be told and retold for a couple of , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: hours more. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: There was no Sabbath-school during day-school vacation, but everybody was , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text:  , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Why, no." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Mrs. Thatcher turned pale, and sank into a pew, just as Aunt Polly, talking , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: briskly with a friend, passed by. Aunt Polly said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Goodmorning, Mrs. Thatcher. Goodmorning, Mrs. Harper. I've got a boy that's , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: turned up missing. I reckon my Tom stayed at your house last night—one of you. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: And now he's afraid to come to church. I've got to settle with him." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Mrs. Thatcher shook her head feebly and turned paler than ever. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "He didn't stay with us," said Mrs. Harper, beginning to look uneasy. A marked , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: anxiety came into Aunt Polly's face. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Joe Harper, have you seen my Tom this morning?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "No'm." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "When did you see him last?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Joe tried to remember, but was not sure he could say. The people had stopped , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: moving out of church. Whispers passed along, and a boding uneasiness took , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: possession of every countenance. Children were anxiously questioned, and young , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: teachers. They all said they had not noticed whether Tom and Becky were on , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: board the ferryboat on the homeward trip; it was dark; no one thought of , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: inquiring if any one was missing. One young man finally blurted out his fear that , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: they were still in the cave! Mrs. Thatcher swooned away. Aunt Polly fell to crying , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and wringing her hands. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: The alarm swept from lip to lip, from group to group, from street to street, and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: within five minutes the bells were wildly clanging and the whole town was up! , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: The Cardiff Hill episode sank into instant insignificance, the burglars were , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: forgotten, horses were saddled, skiffs were manned, the ferryboat ordered out, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and before the horror was half an hour old, two hundred men were pouring down , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: highroad and river toward the cave. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: All the long afternoon the village seemed empty and dead. Many women visited , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Aunt Polly and Mrs. Thatcher and tried to comfort them. They cried with them, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: too, and that was still better than words. All the tedious night the town waited for , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: news; but when the morning dawned at last, all the word that came was, "Send , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: more candles—and send food." Mrs. Thatcher was almost crazed; and Aunt Polly, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: also. Judge Thatcher sent messages of hope and encouragement from the cave, but , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: they conveyed no real cheer. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: The old Welshman came home toward daylight, spattered with candle-grease, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: smeared with clay, and almost worn out. He found Huck still in the bed that had , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: would do her best by him, because, whether he was good, bad, or indifferent, he , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: was the Lord's, and nothing that was the Lord's was a thing to be neglected. The , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Welshman said Huck had good spots in him, and the widow said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "You can depend on it. That's the Lord's mark. He don't leave it off. He never , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text:  , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Early in the forenoon parties of jaded men began to straggle into the village, but , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the strongest of the citizens continued searching. All the news that could be , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: gained was that remotenesses of the cavern were being ransacked that had never , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: been visited before; that every corner and crevice was going to be thoroughly , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: searched; that wherever one wandered through the maze of passages, lights were , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: to be seen flitting hither and thither in the distance, and shoutings and pistol-, Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: shots sent their hollow reverberations to the ear down the sombre aisles. In one , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: place, far from the section usually traversed by tourists, the names "BECKY & , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: TOM" had been found traced upon the rocky wall with candle-smoke, and near at , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: hand a grease-soiled bit of ribbon. Mrs. Thatcher recognized the ribbon and cried , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: over it. She said it was the last relic she should ever have of her child; and that no , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: other memorial of her could ever be so precious, because this one parted latest , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: from the living body before the awful death came. Some said that now and then, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: in the cave, a far-away speck of light would glimmer, and then a glorious shout , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: would burst forth and a score of men go trooping down the echoing aisle—and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: then a sickening disappointment always followed; the children were not there; it , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: was only a searcher's light. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Three dreadful days and nights dragged their tedious hours along, and the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: village sank into a hopeless stupor. No one had heart for anything. The accidental , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: discovery, just made, that the proprietor of the Temperance Tavern kept liquor on , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: his premises, scarcely fluttered the public pulse, tremendous as the fact was. In a , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: lucid interval, Huck feebly led up to the subject of taverns, and finally asked—, Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: dimly dreading the worst—if anything had been discovered at the Temperance , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Tavern since he had been ill. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Yes," said the widow. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Huck started up in bed, wildeyed: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "What? What was it?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Liquor!—and the place has been shut up. Lie down, child—what a turn you did , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: give me!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Only tell me just one thing—only just one—please! Was it Tom Sawyer that , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: found it?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: The widow burst into tears. "Hush, hush, child, hush! I've told you before, you , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: must NOT talk. You are very, very sick!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Then nothing but liquor had been found; there would have been a great , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: powwow if it had been the gold. So the treasure was gone forever—gone forever! , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: But what could she be crying about? Curious that she should cry. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: These thoughts worked their dim way through Huck's mind, and under the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: NOW to return to Tom and Becky's share in the picnic. They tripped along the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: murky aisles with the rest of the company, visiting the familiar wonders of the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: cave—wonders dubbed with rather over-descriptive names, such as "The Drawing-, Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Room," "The Cathedral," "Aladdin's Palace," and so on. Presently the hide-and-seek , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: frolicking began, and Tom and Becky engaged in it with zeal until the exertion , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: began to grow a trifle wearisome; then they wandered down a sinuous avenue , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: holding their candles aloft and reading the tangled webwork of names, dates, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: postoffice addresses, and mottoes with which the rocky walls had been frescoed , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: (in candle-smoke). Still drifting along and talking, they scarcely noticed that they , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: were now in a part of the cave whose walls were not frescoed. They smoked their , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: own names under an overhanging shelf and moved on. Presently they came to a , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: place where a little stream of water, trickling over a ledge and carrying a , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: limestone sediment with it, had, in the slow-dragging ages, formed a laced and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: ruffled Niagara in gleaming and imperishable stone. Tom squeezed his small body , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: behind it in order to illuminate it for Becky's gratification. He found that it , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: curtained a sort of steep natural stairway which was enclosed between narrow , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: walls, and at once the ambition to be a discoverer seized him.  , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Becky responded to his call, and they made a smoke-mark for future guidance, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and started upon their quest. They wound this way and that, far down into the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: secret depths of the cave, made another mark, and branched off in search of , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: novelties to tell the upper world about. In one place they found a spacious cavern, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: from whose ceiling depended a multitude of shining stalactites of the length and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: circumference of a man's leg; they walked all about it, wondering and admiring, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and presently left it by one of the numerous passages that opened into it. This , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: shortly brought them to a bewitching spring, whose basin was incrusted with a , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: frostwork of glittering crystals; it was in the midst of a cavern whose walls were , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: supported by many fantastic pillars which had been formed by the joining of great , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: stalactites and stalagmites together, the result of the ceaseless water-drip of , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: centuries. Under the roof vast knots of bats had packed themselves together, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: thousands in a bunch; the lights disturbed the creatures and they came flocking , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: down by hundreds, squeaking and darting furiously at the candles. Tom knew , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: their ways and the danger of this sort of conduct. He seized Becky's hand and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: hurried her into the first corridor that offered; and none too soon, for a bat struck , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Becky's light out with its wing while she was passing out of the cavern. The bats , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: chased the children a good distance; but the fugitives plunged into every new , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: passage that offered, and at last got rid of the perilous things. Tom found a , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: subterranean lake, shortly, which stretched its dim length away until its shape , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: was lost in the shadows. He wanted to explore its borders, but concluded that it , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: would be best to sit down and rest awhile, first. Now, for the first time, the deep , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: stillness of the place laid a clammy hand upon the spirits of the children. Becky , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Why, I didn't notice, but it seems ever so long since I heard any of the others." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Come to think, Becky, we are away down below them—and I don't know how , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: far away north, or south, or east, or whichever it is. We couldn't hear them here." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Becky grew apprehensive. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I wonder how long we've been down here, Tom? We better start back." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Yes, I reckon we better. P'raps we better." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Can you find the way, Tom? It's all a mixed-up crookedness to me." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I reckon I could find it—but then the bats. If they put our candles out it will be , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: an awful fix. Let's try some other way, so as not to go through there." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Well. But I hope we won't get lost. It would be so awful!" and the girl , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: shuddered at the thought of the dreadful possibilities. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: They started through a corridor, and traversed it in silence a long way, glancing , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: at each new opening, to see if there was anything familiar about the look of it; but , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: they were all strange. Every time Tom made an examination, Becky would watch , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: his face for an encouraging sign, and he would say cheerily: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Oh, it's all right. This ain't the one, but we'll come to it right away!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: But he felt less and less hopeful with each failure, and presently began to turn , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: off into diverging avenues at sheer random, in desperate hope of finding the one , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: that was wanted. He still said it was "all right," but there was such a leaden dread , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: at his heart that the words had lost their ring and sounded just as if he had said, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "All is lost!" Becky clung to his side in an anguish of fear, and tried hard to keep , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: back the tears, but they would come. At last she said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Oh, Tom, never mind the bats, let's go back that way! We seem to get worse , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and worse off all the time." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Listen!" said he. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Profound silence; silence so deep that even their breathings were conspicuous in , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the hush. Tom shouted. The call went echoing down the empty aisles and died out , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: in the distance in a faint sound that resembled a ripple of mocking laughter. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Oh, don't do it again, Tom, it is too horrid," said Becky. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "It is horrid, but I better, Becky; they might hear us, you know," and he shouted , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: again. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: The "might" was even a chillier horror than the ghostly laughter, it so confessed , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: a perishing hope. The children stood still and listened; but there was no result. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Tom turned upon the back track at once, and hurried his steps. It was but a little , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: while before a certain indecision in his manner revealed another fearful fact to , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Becky—he could not find his way back! , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Oh, Tom, you didn't make any marks!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Becky, I was such a fool! Such a fool! I never thought we might want to come , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: back! No—I can't find the way. It's all mixed up." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Tom, Tom, we're lost! we're lost! We never can get out of this awful place! Oh, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: why DID we ever leave the others!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: She sank to the ground and burst into such a frenzy of crying that Tom was , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: appalled with the idea that she might die, or lose her reason. He sat down by her , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and put his arms around her; she buried her face in his bosom, she clung to him, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: she poured out her terrors, her unavailing regrets, and the far echoes turned them , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: all to jeering laughter. Tom begged her to pluck up hope again, and she said she , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: could not. He fell to blaming and abusing himself for getting her into this , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: miserable situation; this had a better effect. She said she would try to hope again, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: she would get up and follow wherever he might lead if only he would not talk like , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: So they moved on again—aimlessly—simply at random—all they could do was , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: to move, keep moving. For a little while, hope made a show of reviving—not with , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: any reason to back it, but only because it is its nature to revive when the spring , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: has not been taken out of it by age and familiarity with failure. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: By-and-by Tom took Becky's candle and blew it out. This economy meant so , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: much! Words were not needed. Becky understood, and her hope died again. She , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: knew that Tom had a whole candle and three or four pieces in his pockets—yet he , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: must economize. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: By-and-by, fatigue began to assert its claims; the children tried to pay attention, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: for it was dreadful to think of sitting down when time was grown to be so , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: precious, moving, in some direction, in any direction, was at least progress and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: might bear fruit; but to sit down was to invite death and shorten its pursuit. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: At last Becky's frail limbs refused to carry her farther. She sat down. Tom rested , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: with her, and they talked of home, and the friends there, and the comfortable , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: beds and, above all, the light! Becky cried, and Tom tried to think of some way of , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: comforting her, but all his encouragements were grown thread-bare with use, and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: sounded like sarcasms. Fatigue bore so heavily upon Becky that she drowsed off , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: to sleep. Tom was grateful. He sat looking into her drawn face and saw it grow , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: smooth and natural under the influence of pleasant dreams; and by-and-by a smile , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: dawned and rested there. The peaceful face reflected somewhat of peace and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: healing into his own spirit, and his thoughts wandered away to bygone times and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: dreamy memories. While he was deep in his musings, Becky woke up with a , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: breezy little laugh—but it was stricken dead upon her lips, and a groan followed , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: it. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Oh, how COULD I sleep! I wish I never, never had waked! No! No, I don't, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Tom! Don't look so! I won't say it again." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I'm glad you've slept, Becky; you'll feel rested, now, and we'll find the way out." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "We can try, Tom; but I've seen such a beautiful country in my dream. I reckon , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: we are going there." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Maybe not, maybe not. Cheer up, Becky, and let's go on trying." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: They rose up and wandered along, hand in hand and hopeless. They tried to , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: estimate how long they had been in the cave, but all they knew was that it , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: seemed days and weeks, and yet it was plain that this could not be, for their , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: candles were not gone yet. A long time after this—they could not tell how long—, Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Tom said they must go softly and listen for dripping water—they must find a , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: spring. They found one presently, and Tom said it was time to rest again. Both , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: were cruelly tired, yet Becky said she thought she could go a little farther. She , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: was surprised to hear Tom dissent. She could not understand it. They sat down, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and Tom fastened his candle to the wall in front of them with some clay. Thought , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: was soon busy; nothing was said for some time. Then Becky broke the silence: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Tom, I am so hungry!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Tom took something out of his pocket. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Do you remember this?" said he. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Becky almost smiled. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "It's our wedding-cake, Tom." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Yes—I wish it was as big as a barrel, for it's all we've got." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I saved it from the picnic for us to dream on, Tom, the way grownup people do , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: with wedding-cake—but it'll be our—" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: She dropped the sentence where it was. Tom divided the cake and Becky ate , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: with good appetite, while Tom nibbled at his moiety. There was abundance of , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: cold water to finish the feast with. By-and-by Becky suggested that they move on , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: again. Tom was silent a moment. Then he said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Becky, can you bear it if I tell you something?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Becky's face paled, but she thought she could. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Well, then, Becky, we must stay here, where there's water to drink. That little , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: piece is our last candle!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Becky gave loose to tears and wailings. Tom did what he could to comfort her, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: but with little effect. At length Becky said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Tom!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Well, Becky?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "They'll miss us and hunt for us!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Yes, they will! Certainly they will!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Maybe they're hunting for us now, Tom." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Why, I reckon maybe they are. I hope they are." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "When would they miss us, Tom?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "When they get back to the boat, I reckon." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Tom, it might be dark then—would they notice we hadn't come?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I don't know. But anyway, your mother would miss you as soon as they got , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: home." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: A frightened look in Becky's face brought Tom to his senses and he saw that he , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: had made a blunder. Becky was not to have gone home that night! The children , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: became silent and thoughtful. In a moment a new burst of grief from Becky , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: showed Tom that the thing in his mind had struck hers also—that the Sabbath , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: morning might be half spent before Mrs. Thatcher discovered that Becky was not , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: at Mrs. Harper's. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: The children fastened their eyes upon their bit of candle and watched it melt , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: slowly and pitilessly away; saw the half inch of wick stand alone at last; saw the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: feeble flame rise and fall, climb the thin column of smoke, linger at its top a , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: moment, and then—the horror of utter darkness reigned! , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: How long afterward it was that Becky came to a slow consciousness that she , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: was crying in Tom's arms, neither could tell. All that they knew was, that after , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: what seemed a mighty stretch of time, both awoke out of a dead stupor of sleep , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and resumed their miseries once more. Tom said it might be Sunday, now—maybe , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Monday. He tried to get Becky to talk, but her sorrows were too oppressive, all , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: her hopes were gone. Tom said that they must have been missed long ago, and no , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: doubt the search was going on. He would shout and maybe some one would come. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: He tried it; but in the darkness the distant echoes sounded so hideously that he , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: tried it no more. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: The hours wasted away, and hunger came to torment the captives again. A , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: portion of Tom's half of the cake was left; they divided and ate it. But they , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: seemed hungrier than before. The poor morsel of food only whetted desire. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: By-and-by Tom said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "SH! Did you hear that?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Both held their breath and listened. There was a sound like the faintest, far-off , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: shout. Instantly Tom answered it, and leading Becky by the hand, started groping , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: down the corridor in its direction. Presently he listened again; again the sound , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: was heard, and apparently a little nearer. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "It's them!" said Tom; "they're coming! Come along, Becky—we're all right now!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: The joy of the prisoners was almost overwhelming. Their speed was slow, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: however, because pitfalls were somewhat common, and had to be guarded , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: against. They shortly came to one and had to stop. It might be three feet deep, it , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: might be a hundred—there was no passing it at any rate. Tom got down on his , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: breast and reached as far down as he could. No bottom. They must stay there and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: wait until the searchers came. They listened; evidently the distant shoutings were , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: growing more distant! a moment or two more and they had gone altogether. The , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: heart-sinking misery of it! Tom whooped until he was hoarse, but it was of no , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: use. He talked hopefully to Becky; but an age of anxious waiting passed and no , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: sounds came again. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: The children groped their way back to the spring. The weary time dragged on; , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: they slept again, and awoke famished and woe-stricken. Tom believed it must be , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Tuesday by this time. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Now an idea struck him. There were some side passages near at hand. It would , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: be better to explore some of these than bear the weight of the heavy time in , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: idleness. He took a kite-line from his pocket, tied it to a projection, and he and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Becky started, Tom in the lead, unwinding the line as he groped along. At the end , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: of twenty steps the corridor ended in a "jumping-off place." Tom got down on his , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: knees and felt below, and then as far around the corner as he could reach with his , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: hands conveniently; he made an effort to stretch yet a little farther to the right, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and at that moment, not twenty yards away, a human hand, holding a candle, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: appeared from behind a rock! Tom lifted up a glorious shout, and instantly that , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: hand was followed by the body it belonged to—Injun Joe's! Tom was paralyzed; he , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: could not move. He was vastly gratified the next moment, to see the "Spaniard" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: take to his heels and get himself out of sight. Tom wondered that Joe had not , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: recognized his voice and come over and killed him for testifying in court. But the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: echoes must have disguised the voice. Without doubt, that was it, he reasoned. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Tom's fright weakened every muscle in his body. He said to himself that if he had , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: strength enough to get back to the spring he would stay there, and nothing should , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: tempt him to run the risk of meeting Injun Joe again. He was careful to keep from , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Becky what it was he had seen. He told her he had only shouted "for luck." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: But hunger and wretchedness rise superior to fears in the long run. Another , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: tedious wait at the spring and another long sleep brought changes. The children , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: awoke tortured with a raging hunger. Tom believed that it must be Wednesday or , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Thursday or even Friday or Saturday, now, and that the search had been given , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: over. He proposed to explore another passage. He felt willing to risk Injun Joe and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: all other terrors. But Becky was very weak. She had sunk into a dreary apathy and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: would not be roused. She said she would wait, now, where she was, and die—it , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: would not be long. She told Tom to go with the kite-line and explore if he chose; , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: but she implored him to come back every little while and speak to her; and she , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: made him promise that when the awful time came, he would stay by her and hold , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: her hand until all was over. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Tom kissed her, with a choking sensation in his throat, and made a show of , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: being confident of finding the searchers or an escape from the cave; then he took , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the kite-line in his hand and went groping down one of the passages on his hands , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: Three days and nights of toil and hunger in the cave were not to be shaken off , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: Tom learned of Huck's sickness and went to see him on Friday, but could not be , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: introduce no exciting topic. The Widow Douglas stayed by to see that he obeyed. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: At home Tom learned of the Cardiff Hill event; also that the "ragged man's" body , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: had eventually been found in the river near the ferry-landing; he had been , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: drowned while trying to escape, perhaps. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: About a fortnight after Tom's rescue from the cave, he started off to visit Huck, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: who had grown plenty strong enough, now, to hear exciting talk, and Tom had , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: some that would interest him, he thought. Judge Thatcher's house was on Tom's , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: way, and he stopped to see Becky. The Judge and some friends set Tom to talking, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and some one asked him ironically if he wouldn't like to go to the cave again. Tom , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: said he thought he wouldn't mind it. The Judge said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Well, there are others just like you, Tom, I've not the least doubt. But we have , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: taken care of that. Nobody will get lost in that cave any more." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Why?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Because I had its big door sheathed with boiler iron two weeks ago, and triple-, Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: WITHIN a few minutes the news had spread, and a dozen skiff-loads of men , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: When the cave door was unlocked, a sorrowful sight presented itself in the dim , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: boats and wagons from the towns and from all the farms and hamlets for seven , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: tearful and eloquent meetings had been held, and a committee of sappy women , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: been appointed to go in deep mourning and wail around the governor, and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: implore him to be a merciful ass and trample his duty under foot. Injun Joe was , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: Huck's face saddened. He said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I know what it is. You got into No. 2 and never found anything but whiskey. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Nobody told me it was you; but I just knowed it must 'a' ben you, soon as I heard , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: 'bout that whiskey business; and I knowed you hadn't got the money becuz you'd , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: "Well," said Huck, presently, coming back to the main question, "whoever , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: "Huck, that money wasn't ever in No. 2!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "What!" Huck searched his comrade's face keenly. "Tom, have you got on the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: "Huck, it's in the cave!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: "Tom—honest injun, now—is it fun, or earnest?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Earnest, Huck—just as earnest as ever I was in my life. Will you go in there , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: with me and help get it out?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I bet I will! I will if it's where we can blaze our way to it and not get lost." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Huck, we can do that without the least little bit of trouble in the world." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Good as wheat! What makes you think the money's—" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Huck, you just wait till we get in there. If we don't find it I'll agree to give you , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: "All right—it's a whiz. When do you say?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Right now, if you say it. Are you strong enough?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Is it far in the cave? I ben on my pins a little, three or four days, now, but I , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: can't walk more'n a mile, Tom—least I don't think I could." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "It's about five mile into there the way anybody but me would go, Huck, but , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: there's a mighty short cut that they don't anybody but me know about. Huck, I'll , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: "Less start right off, Tom." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "All right. We want some bread and meat, and our pipes, and a little bag or two, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and two or three kite-strings, and some of these new-fangled things they call , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: "Now you see this bluff here looks all alike all the way down from the cave , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: place up yonder where there's been a landslide? Well, that's one of my marks. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: We'll get ashore, now." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: They landed. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Now, Huck, where we're a-standing you could touch that hole I got out of with , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: a fishing-pole. See if you can find it." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Huck searched all the place about, and found nothing. Tom proudly marched , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: into a thick clump of sumach bushes and said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Here you are! Look at it, Huck; it's the snuggest hole in this country. You just , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: Tom Sawyer's Gang—it sounds splendid, don't it, Huck?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Well, it just does, Tom. And who'll we rob?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Oh, most anybody. Waylay people—that's mostly the way." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "And kill them?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "No, not always. Hive them in the cave till they raise a ransom." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "What's a ransom?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Money. You make them raise all they can, off'n their friends; and after you've , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: kept them a year, if it ain't raised then you kill them. That's the general way. Only , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: you don't kill the women. You shut up the women, but you don't kill them. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: They're always beautiful and rich, and awfully scared. You take their watches and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: things, but you always take your hat off and talk polite. They ain't anybody as , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: polite as robbers—you'll see that in any book. Well, the women get to loving you, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and after they've been in the cave a week or two weeks they stop crying and after , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: that you couldn't get them to leave. If you drove them out they'd turn right around , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and come back. It's so in all the books." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Why, it's real bully, Tom. I believe it's better'n to be a pirate." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Yes, it's better in some ways, because it's close to home and circuses and all , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: that." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: By this time everything was ready and the boys entered the hole, Tom in the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: spliced kite-strings fast and moved on. A few steps brought them to the spring, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: and Tom felt a shudder quiver all through him. He showed Huck the fragment of , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: candle-wick perched on a lump of clay against the wall, and described how he and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Becky had watched the flame struggle and expire. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: The boys began to quiet down to whispers, now, for the stillness and gloom of , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the place oppressed their spirits. They went on, and presently entered and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: followed Tom's other corridor until they reached the "jumping-off place." The , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: candles revealed the fact that it was not really a precipice, but only a steep clay , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: "Now I'll show you something, Huck." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: He held his candle aloft and said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: "What! and leave the treasure?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: going to come around where there's a cross!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: The point was well taken. It had its effect. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Tom, I didn't think of that. But that's so. It's luck for us, that cross is. I reckon , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: we'll climb down there and have a hunt for that box." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Tom went first, cutting rude steps in the clay hill as he descended. Huck , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: followed. Four avenues opened out of the small cavern which the great rock stood , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: in. The boys examined three of them with no result. They found a small recess in , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the one nearest the base of the rock, with a pallet of blankets spread down in it; , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: also an old suspender, some bacon rind, and the well-gnawed bones of two or , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: three fowls. But there was no moneybox. The lads searched and researched this , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: place, but in vain. Tom said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "He said UNDER the cross. Well, this comes nearest to being under the cross. It , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: can't be under the rock itself, because that sets solid on the ground." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: They searched everywhere once more, and then sat down discouraged. Huck , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: could suggest nothing. By-and-by Tom said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Lookyhere, Huck, there's footprints and some candle-grease on the clay about , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: one side of this rock, but not on the other sides. Now, what's that for? I bet you , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the money IS under the rock. I'm going to dig in the clay." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "That ain't no bad notion, Tom!" said Huck with animation. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Tom's "real Barlow" was out at once, and he had not dug four inches before he , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: struck wood. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Hey, Huck!—you hear that?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Huck began to dig and scratch now. Some boards were soon uncovered and , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: removed. They had concealed a natural chasm which led under the rock. Tom got , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: into this and held his candle as far under the rock as he could, but said he could , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: not see to the end of the rift. He proposed to explore. He stooped and passed , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: under; the narrow way descended gradually. He followed its winding course, first , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: to the right, then to the left, Huck at his heels. Tom turned a short curve, by-and-, Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: by, and exclaimed: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "My goodness, Huck, lookyhere!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: It was the treasure-box, sure enough, occupying a snug little cavern, along with , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: an empty powder-keg, a couple of guns in leather cases, two or three pairs of old , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: moccasins, a leather belt, and some other rubbish well soaked with the water-, Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: drip. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Got it at last!" said Huck, ploughing among the tarnished coins with his hand. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "My, but we're rich, Tom!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Huck, I always reckoned we'd get it. It's just too good to believe, but we HAVE , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: got it, sure! Say—let's not fool around here. Let's snake it out. Lemme see if I can , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: lift the box." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: It weighed about fifty pounds. Tom could lift it, after an awkward fashion, but , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: could not carry it conveniently. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I thought so," he said; "THEY carried it like it was heavy, that day at the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: ha'nted house. I noticed that. I reckon I was right to think of fetching the little , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: bags along." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: The money was soon in the bags and the boys took it up to the cross rock. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Now less fetch the guns and things," said Huck. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "No, Huck—leave them there. They're just the tricks to have when we go to , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: robbing. We'll keep them there all the time, and we'll hold our orgies there, too. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: It's an awful snug place for orgies." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "What orgies?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I dono. But robbers always have orgies, and of course we've got to have them, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: too. Come along, Huck, we've been in here a long time. It's getting late, I reckon. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: I'm hungry, too. We'll eat and smoke when we get to the skiff." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: They presently emerged into the clump of sumach bushes, looked warily out, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: found the coast clear, and were soon lunching and smoking in the skiff. As the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: sun dipped toward the horizon they pushed out and got under way. Tom skimmed , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: up the shore through the long twilight, chatting cheerily with Huck, and landed , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: shortly after dark. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Now, Huck," said Tom, "we'll hide the money in the loft of the widow's , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: woodshed, and I'll come up in the morning and we'll count it and divide, and then , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: we'll hunt up a place out in the woods for it where it will be safe. Just you lay , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: quiet here and watch the stuff till I run and hook Benny Taylor's little wagon; I , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: won't be gone a minute." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: He disappeared, and presently returned with the wagon, put the two small , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: sacks into it, threw some old rags on top of them, and started off, dragging his , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: cargo behind him. When the boys reached the Welshman's house, they stopped to , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: rest. Just as they were about to move on, the Welshman stepped out and said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Hallo, who's that?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Huck and Tom Sawyer." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Good! Come along with me, boys, you are keeping everybody waiting. Here—, Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: hurry up, trot ahead—I'll haul the wagon for you. Why, it's not as light as it might , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: be. Got bricks in it?—or old metal?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Old metal," said Tom. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I judged so; the boys in this town will take more trouble and fool away more , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: time hunting up six bits' worth of old iron to sell to the foundry than they would , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: to make twice the money at regular work. But that's human nature—hurry along, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: hurry along!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: The boys wanted to know what the hurry was about. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Never mind; you'll see, when we get to the Widow Douglas'." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Huck said with some apprehension—for he was long used to being falsely , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: accused: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Mr. Jones, we haven't been doing nothing." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: The Welshman laughed. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Well, I don't know, Huck, my boy. I don't know about that. Ain't you and the , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: widow good friends?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Yes. Well, she's ben good friends to me, anyway." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "All right, then. What do you want to be afraid for?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: This question was not entirely answered in Huck's slow mind before he found , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: himself pushed, along with Tom, into Mrs. Douglas' drawing-room. Mr. Jones left , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the wagon near the door and followed. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: The place was grandly lighted, and everybody that was of any consequence in , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the village was there. The Thatchers were there, the Harpers, the Rogerses, Aunt , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Polly, Sid, Mary, the minister, the editor, and a great many more, and all dressed , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: in their best. The widow received the boys as heartily as any one could well , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: receive two such looking beings. They were covered with clay and candle-grease. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Aunt Polly blushed crimson with humiliation, and frowned and shook her head at , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Tom. Nobody suffered half as much as the two boys did, however. Mr. Jones said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Tom wasn't at home, yet, so I gave him up; but I stumbled on him and Huck , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: right at my door, and so I just brought them along in a hurry." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "And you did just right," said the widow. "Come with me, boys." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: She took them to a bedchamber and said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Now wash and dress yourselves. Here are two new suits of clothes—shirts, , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: socks, everything complete. They're Huck's—no, no thanks, Huck—Mr. Jones , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: "Shucks! what do you want to slope for?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: "Well, what?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Why, old Mr. Jones is going to try to spring something on the people here , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: "Secret about what, Sid?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "About Huck tracking the robbers to the widow's. I reckon Mr. Jones was going , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: "Sid, was it you that told?" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: "Sid, there's only one person in this town mean enough to do that, and that's , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: you. If you had been in Huck's place you'd 'a' sneaked down the hill and never , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: told anybody on the robbers. You can't do any but mean things, and you can't , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: bear to see anybody praised for doing good ones. There—no thanks, as the widow , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: says"—and Tom cuffed Sid's ears and helped him to the door with several kicks. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Now go and tell auntie if you dare—and tomorrow you'll catch it!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: Some minutes later the widow's guests were at the supper-table, and a dozen , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: children were propped up at little side-tables in the same room, after the fashion , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: but said that there was another person whose modesty— , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: occasioned was largely counterfeit and not as clamorous and effusive as it might , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: have been under happier circumstances. However, the widow made a pretty fair , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: show of astonishment, and heaped so many compliments and so much gratitude , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: upon Huck that he almost forgot the nearly intolerable discomfort of his new , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: everybody's gaze and everybody's laudations. , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: The widow said she meant to give Huck a home under her roof and have him , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: Nothing but a heavy strain upon the good manners of the company kept back , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: the due and proper complimentary laugh at this pleasant joke. But the silence was , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: a little awkward. Tom broke it: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "Huck's got money. Maybe you don't believe it, but he's got lots of it. Oh, you , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: needn't smile—I reckon I can show you. You just wait a minute." , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: Tom entered, struggling with the weight of his sacks, and Aunt Polly did not , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: "There—what did I tell you? Half of it's Huck's and half of it's mine!" , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: The spectacle took the general breath away. All gazed, nobody spoke for a , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: moment. Then there was a unanimous call for an explanation. Tom said he could , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: furnish it, and he did. The tale was long, but brimful of interest. There was , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: scarcely an interruption from any one to break the charm of its flow. When he had , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: finished, Mr. Jones said: , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
Text: "I thought I had fixed up a little surprise for this occasion, but it don't amount , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0

Text: The money was counted. The sum amounted to a little over twelve thousand , Font: MattAntiqueBT-Roman, Size: 12.0
