Text: and although ignorant of the game, which he had never , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0

Text: from nine o’clock in the morning, as it then scarcely was, , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0
Text: till twelve., Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0
Text: The two Musketeers were already there, and were playing , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0
Text: together. Athos, who was very expert in all bodily exercises, , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0
Text: passed with d’Artagnan to the opposite side and challenged , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0
Text: them; but at the first effort he made, although he played with , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0
Text: his left hand, he found that his wound was yet too recent , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0
Text: to allow of such exertion. D’Artagnan remained, therefore, , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0
Text: alone; and as he declared he was too ignorant of the game , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0
Text: to play it regularly they only continued giving balls to one , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0
Text: another without counting. But one of these balls, launched , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0
Text: by Porthos’ herculean hand, passed so close to d’Artagnan’s , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0
Text: face that he thought that if, instead of passing near, it had , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0
Text: hit him, his audience would have been probably lost, as it , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0

Text: Indeed, the name of Bernajoux was known to all the , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0

Text: descended in his turn. As d’Artagnan had no time to lose, , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0
Text: on account of the audience of the king, which was fixed for , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0
Text: midday, he cast his eyes around, and seeing that the street , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0
Text: was empty, said to his adversary, ‘My faith! It is fortunate , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0

Text: future favor, he was resolved not to recoil a step. So the two , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0
Text: swords were crossed close to the hilts, and as d’Artagnan , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0
Text: stood firm, it was his adversary who made the retreating , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0

Text: tation of the walk, and the indecision of the step, he soon , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0
Text: discovered that it was a woman. Further, this woman, as if , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0
Text: not certain of the house she was seeking, lifted up her eyes , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0
Text: to look around her, stopped, went backward, and then re-, Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0

Text: He was right; at the end of some seconds two sharp taps , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0

Text: a single tap, and the shutter was opened a little way., Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0
Text: It may be judged whether d’Artagnan looked or listened , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0
Text: with avidity. Unfortunately the light had been removed , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0

Text: In the meantime d’Artagnan, who had plunged into a by-, Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0

Text: of following the main street he turned behind the chateau, , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0
Text: reached a sort of retired lane, and found himself soon in , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0
Text: front of the pavilion named. It was situated in a very private , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0

Text: He gained the place appointed, and as no signal had been , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0

Text: Not the least noise was to be heard; it might be imagined , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0
Text: that he was a hundred miles from the capital. D’Artagnan , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0
Text: leaned against the hedge, after having cast a glance behind , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0

Text: But for d’Artagnan all aspects were clothed happily, all , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0

Text: this brazen voice pouring out its lamentations in the middle , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0

Text: young man., Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0
Text: His eyes were fixed upon the little pavilion situated at the , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0
Text: angle of the wall, of which all the windows were closed with , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0
Text: shutters, except one on the first story. Through this window , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0

Text: The belfry of St. Cloud sounded half past ten., Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0
Text: This time, without knowing why, d’Artagnan felt a cold , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0

Text: fect him, and he took a perfectly physical sensation for a , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0
Text: moral impression., Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0
Text: Then the idea seized him that he had read incorrectly, , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0
Text: and that the appointment was for eleven o’clock. He drew , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0
Text: near to the window, and placing himself so that a ray of , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0
Text: light should fall upon the letter as he held it, he drew it from , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0
Text: his pocket and read it again; but he had not been mistaken, , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0
Text: the appointment was for ten o’clock. He went and resumed , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0

Text: Eleven o’clock sounded., Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0
Text: D’Artagnan began now really to fear that something had , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0
Text: happened to Mme. Bonacieux. He clapped his hands three , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0
Text: times—the ordinary signal of lovers; but nobody replied to , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0
Text: him, not even an echo., Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0
Text: He then thought, with a touch of vexation, that perhaps , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0
Text: the young woman had fallen asleep while waiting for him. , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0
Text: He approached the wall, and tried to climb it; but the wall , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0
Text: had been recently pointed, and d’Artagnan could get no , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0
Text: hold., Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0

Text: glimpse of the interior of the pavilion., Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0
Text: The tree was easy to climb. Besides, d’Artagnan was but , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0
Text: twenty years old, and consequently had not yet forgotten his , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0
Text: schoolboy habits. In an instant he was among the branches, , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0
Text: and his keen eyes plunged through the transparent panes , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0
Text: into the interior of the pavilion., Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0
Text: It was a strange thing, and one which made d’Artagnan , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0
Text: tremble from the sole of his foot to the roots of his hair, to , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0
Text: find that this soft light, this calm lamp, enlightened a scene , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0
Text: of fearful disorder. One of the windows was broken, the , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0
Text: door of the chamber had been beaten in and hung, split in , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0
Text: two, on its hinges. A table, which had been covered with , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0
Text: an elegant supper, was overturned. The decanters broken in , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0
Text: pieces, and the fruits crushed, strewed the floor. Everything , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0
Text: in the apartment gave evidence of a violent and desperate , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0

Text: this strange disorder, fragments of garments, and some , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0
Text: bloody spots staining the cloth and the curtains. He has-, Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0
Text: tened to descend into the street, with a frightful beating at , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0

Text: At length d’Artagnan, in pursuing his researches, found , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0

Text: assure himself, that this pavilion perhaps had nothing in , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0
Text: common with Mme. Bonacieux; that the young woman had , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0
Text: made an appointment with him before the pavilion, and not , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0
Text: in the pavilion; that she might have been detained in Paris , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0
Text: by her duties, or perhaps by the jealousy of her husband., Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0
Text: But all these reasons were combated, destroyed, over-, Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0

Text: as to be understood unmistakably that some great misfor-, Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0
Text: tune is hanging over us., Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0
Text: Then d’Artagnan became almost wild. He ran along the , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0
Text: high road, took the path he had before taken, and reaching , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0
Text: the ferry, interrogated the boatman., Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0

Text: his presentiments had not deceived him, and that a great , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0
Text: misfortune had happened., Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0
Text: He again ran back to the chateau. It appeared to him that , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0
Text: something might have happened at the pavilion in his ab-, Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0
Text: sence, and that fresh information awaited him. The lane was , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0
Text: still deserted, and the same calm soft light shone through , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0
Text: the window., Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0

Text: The gate of the enclosure was shut; but he leaped over the , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0

Text: ‘In the name of heaven!’ cried he, ‘listen to me; I have , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0

Text: into the easiest position in his corner and to sleep, whether , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0

Text: M. de Treville would doubtless give him good advice as to , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0
Text: the whole affair. Besides, as M. de Treville saw the queen , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0

Text: some intelligence of the poor young woman, whom they , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0

Text: ‘Nothing, absolutely nothing, at present, but quitting , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0

Text: the suspicions d’Artagnan had conceived. Bonacieux had , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0
Text: named Mande because Mande was in an exactly opposite , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0
Text: direction from St. Cloud. This probability afforded him his , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0
Text: first consolation. If Bonacieux knew where his wife was, , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0
Text: one might, by extreme means, force the mercer to open his , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0

Text: what had become of the Musketeer. The result of these re-, Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0

Text: d’Artagnan knew that while his Eminence was terrible to , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0

Text: about to go out. ‘Is this corpse come to life already? Felton, , Font: MinionPro-Regular, Size: 10.0
