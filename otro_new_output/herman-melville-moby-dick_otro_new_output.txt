Text: a hot sun’s tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one. However, I had never, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516

Text: eﬀes upon the skin. Now, while all these ideas were passing through me like, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: lightning, this harpooneer never noticed me at all. But, after some diﬃculty having, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: opened his bag, he commenced fumbling in it, and presently pulled out a sort of, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: tomahawk, and a seal-skin wallet with the hair on. Placing these on the old chest, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: in the middle of the room, he then took the New Zealand head—a ghastly thing, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: enough—and crammed it down into the bag. He now took oﬀ his hat—a new, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516

Text: up on his forehead. His bald purplish head now looked for all the world like a, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516

Text: men, the sin of this son of Amittai was in his wilful disobedience of the command, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: of God—never mind now what that command was, or how conveyed—which he, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516

Text: us to do—remember that—and hence, he oftener commands us than endeavors, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516

Text: perhaps, a hitherto unheeded meaning here. By all accounts Tarshish could have, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516

Text: Jonah to the bill; while all his sympathetic shipmates now crowd round Jonah,, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516

Text: all his boldness to his face, only looks so much the more a coward. He will not, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: confess himself suspeed; but that itself is strong suspicion. So he makes the best, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516

Text: papers for the Customs—“Who’s there?” Oh! how that harmless question mangles, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: Jonah! For the instant he almost turns to ﬂee again. But he rallies. “I seek a passage, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: in this ship to Tarshish; how soon sail ye, sir?” us far the busy captain had not, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: looked up to Jonah, though the man now stands before him; but no sooner does he, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: hear that hollow voice, than he darts a scrutinizing glance. “We sail with the next, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: coming tide,” at last he slowly answered, still intently eyeing him. “No sooner,, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: sir?”—“Soon enough for any honest man that goes a passenger.” Ha! Jonah, that’s, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: another stab. But he swiftly calls away the Captain from that scent. “I’ll sail with, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: ye,”—he says,—“the passage money, how much is that,—I’ll pay now.“ For it is, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516

Text: Jonah fairly takes out his purse, prudent suspicions still molest the Captain. He, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516

Text: e chief mate of the Pequod was Starbuck, a native of Nantucket, and a Quaker, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: by descent. He was a long, earnest man, and though born on an icy coast, seemed, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: well adapted to endure hot latitudes, his ﬂesh being hard as twice-baked biscuit., Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: Transported to the Indies, his live blood would not spoil like bottled ale. He must, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: have been born in some time of general drought and famine, or upon one of those, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: fast days for which his state is famous. Only some thirty arid summers had he, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: seen; those summers had dried up all his physical superﬂuousness. But this, his, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: thinness, so to speak, seemed no more the token of wasting anxieties and cares,, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: than it seemed the indication of any bodily blight. It was merely the condensation, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: of the man. He was by no means ill-looking; quite the contrary. His pure tight, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: skin was an excellent ﬁt; and closely wrapped up in it, and embalmed with inner, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: health and strength, like a reviviﬁed Egyptian, this Starbuck seemed prepared to, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: endure for long ages to come, and to endure always, as now; for be it Polar snow or, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: torrid sun, like a patent chronometer, his interior vitality was warranted to do well, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: in all climates. Looking into his eyes, you seemed to see there the yet lingering, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: images of those thousand-fold perils he had calmly confronted through life. A, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: staid, steadfast man, whose life for the most part was a telling pantomime of aion,, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: and not a tame chapter of sounds. Yet, for all his hardy sobriety and fortitude, there, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: were certain qualities in him which at times aﬀeed, and in some cases seemed, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: well nigh to overbalance all the rest. Uncommonly conscientious for a seaman,, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: and endued with a deep natural reverence, the wild watery loneliness of his life, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: did therefore strongly incline him to superstition; but to that sort of superstition,, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: which in some organizations seems rather to spring, somehow, from intelligence, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: than from ignorance. Outward portents and inward presentiments were his. And, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: if at times these things bent the welded iron of his soul, much more did his far-, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: away domestic memories of his young Cape wife and child, tend to bend him, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516

Text: , Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: those latent inﬂuences which, in some honest-hearted men, restrain the gush of, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: dare-devil daring, so often evinced by others in the more perilous vicissitudes of, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: the ﬁshery. ”I will have no man in my boat,” said Starbuck, “who is not afraid of, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: a whale.“ By this, he seemed to mean, not only that the most reliable and useful, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: courage was that which arises from the fair estimation of the encountered peril,, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: but that an utterly fearless man is a far more dangerous comrade than a coward., Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: ”Aye, aye,” said Stubb, the second mate, ”Starbuck, there, is as careful a man, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: as you’ll ﬁnd anywhere in this ﬁshery.” But we shall ere long see what that word, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: “careful” precisely means when used by a man like Stubb, or almost any other, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: whale hunter., Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: Starbuck was no crusader after perils; in him courage was not a sentiment;, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: but a thing simply useful to him, and always at hand upon all mortally praical, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: occasions. Besides, he thought, perhaps, that in this business of whaling, courage, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: was one of the great staple outﬁts of the ship, like her beef and her bread, and not, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: to be foolishly wasted. Wherefore he had no fancy for lowering for whales after, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: sun-down; nor for persisting in ﬁghting a ﬁsh that too much persisted in ﬁghting, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: him. For, thought Starbuck, I am here in this critical ocean to kill whales for my, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: living, and not to be killed by them for theirs; and that hundreds of men had been, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516

Text: still ﬂourish, must indeed have been extreme. But it was not in reasonable nature, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: that a man so organized, and with such terrible experiences and remembrances as, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: he had; it was not in nature that these things should fail in latently engendering, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: an element in him, which, under suitable circumstances, would break out from, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: its conﬁnement, and burn all his courage up. And brave as he might be, it was, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: that sort of bravery chieﬂy, visible in some intrepid men, which, while generally, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: abiding ﬁrm in the conﬂi with seas, or winds, or whales, or any of the ordinary, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516

Text: presided over his whale-boat as if the most deadly encounter were but a dinner, and, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516

Text: Nor would diﬀerence of country make any very essential diﬀerence; that is, so, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: long as both parties speak one language, as is the case with Americans and English., Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: ough, to be sure, from the small number of English whalers, such meetings do, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: not very often occur, and when they do occur there is too apt to be a sort of shyness, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: between them; for your Englishman is rather reserved, and your Yankee, he does, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: not fancy that sort of thing in anybody but himself. Besides, the English whalers, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: sometimes aﬀe a kind of metropolitan superiority over the American whalers;, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: regarding the long, lean Nantucketer, with his nondescript provincialisms, as a, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: sort of sea-peasant. But where this superiority in the English whalemen does really, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: consist, it would be hard to say, seeing that the Yankees in one day, colleively, kill, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: more whales than all the English, colleively, in ten years. But this is a harmless, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: little foible in the English whale-hunters, which the Nantucketer does not take, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: much to heart; probably, because he knows that he has a few foibles himself., Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: So, then, we see that of all ships separately sailing the sea, the whalers have most, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: reason to be sociable—and they are so. Whereas, some merchant ships crossing, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: each other’s wake in the mid-Atlantic, will oftentimes pass on without so much, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: as a single word of recognition, mutually cutting each other on the high seas, like, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: a brace of dandies in Broadway; and all the time indulging, perhaps, in ﬁnical, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516

Text: they are in such a prodigious hurry, they run away from each other as soon as, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: possible. And as for Pirates, when they chance to cross each other’s cross-bones,, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: the ﬁrst hail is—“How many skulls?”—the same way that whalers hail—“How, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: many barrels?” And that question once answered, pirates straightway steer apart,, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516

Text: scornful feeling towards Whale-ships; this is a question it would be hard to answer., Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: Because, in the case of pirates, say, I should like to know whether that profession of, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: theirs has any peculiar glory about it. It sometimes ends in uncommon elevation,, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: indeed; but only at the gallows. And besides, when a man is elevated in that odd, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: fashion, he has no proper foundation for his superior altitude. Hence, I conclude,, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: that in boasting himself to be high lifted above a whaleman, in that assertion the, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516

Text: THE LINE, Font: AGaramondPro-Bold, Size: 24.78700065612793
Text: With reference to the whaling scene shortly to be described, as well as for the better, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: understanding of all similar scenes elsewhere presented, I have here to speak of the, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: magical, sometimes horrible whale-line., Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: e line originally used in the ﬁshery was of the best hemp, slightly vapored, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: with tar, not impregnated with it, as in the case of ordinary ropes; for while tar, as, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: ordinarily used, makes the hemp more pliable to the rope-maker, and also renders, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: the rope itself more convenient to the sailor for common ship use; yet, not only, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: would the ordinary quantity too much stiﬀen the whale-line for the close coiling, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: to which it must be subjeed; but as most seamen are beginning to learn, tar in, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: general by no means adds to the rope’s durability or strength, however much it, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: may give it companess and gloss., Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: Of late years the Manilla rope has in the American ﬁshery almost entirely, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: superseded hemp as a material for whale-lines; for, though not so durable as hemp,, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: it is stronger, and far more soft and elastic; and I will add (since there is an aesthetics, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: in all things), is much more handsome and becoming to the boat, than hemp., Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: Hemp is a dusky, dark fellow, a sort of Indian; but Manilla is as a golden-haired, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: Circassian to behold., Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: e whale line is only two thirds of an inch in thickness. At ﬁrst sight, you, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: would not think it so strong as it really is. By experiment its one and ﬁfty yarns will, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: each suspend a weight of one hundred and twenty pounds; so that the whole rope, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: will bear a strain nearly equal to three tons. In length, the common sperm whale-, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: line measures something over two hundred fathoms. Towards the stern of the boat, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: it is spirally coiled away in the tub, not like the worm-pipe of a still though, but so, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: as to form one round, cheese-shaped mass of densely bedded “sheaves,” or layers of, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: concentric spiralizations, without any hollow but the “heart”, or minute vertical, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: tube formed at the axis of the cheese. As the least tangle or kink in the coiling, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516

Text: , Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: utmost precaution is used in stowing the line in its tub. Some harpooneers will, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: consume almost an entire morning in this business, carrying the line high aloft, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: and then reeving it downwards through a block towards the tub, so as in the a, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: of coiling to free it from all possible wrinkles and twists., Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: In the English boats two tubs are used instead of one; the same line being, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: continuously coiled in both tubs. ere is some advantage in this; because these, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: twin-tubs being so small they ﬁt more readily into the boat, and do not strain it, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: so much; whereas, the American tub, nearly three feet in diameter and of propor-, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: tionate depth, makes a rather bulky freight for a craft whose planks are but one, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: half-inch in thickness; for the bottom of the whale-boat is like critical ice, which, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: will bear up a considerable distributed weight, but not very much of a concen-, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: trated one. When the painted canvas cover is clapped on the american line-tub,, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: the boat looks as if it were pulling oﬀ with a prodigious great wedding-cake to, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: present to the whales., Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: Both ends of the line are exposed; the lower end terminating in an eye-splice, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: or loop coming up from the bottom against the side of the tub, and hanging over, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: its edge completely disengaged from everything. is arrangement of the lower, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: end is necessary on two accounts. First: In order to facilitate the fastening to it, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: of an additional line from a neighboring boat, in case the stricken whale should, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: sound so deep as to threaten to carry oﬀ the entire line originally attached to the, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: harpoon. In these instances, the whale of course is shifted like a mug of ale, as it, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: were, from the one boat to the other; though the ﬁrst boat always hovers at hand to, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: assist its consort. Second: is arrangement is indispensable for common safety’s, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516

Text: he sometimes does, he would not stop there, for the doomed boat would infallibly, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516

Text: of a common quill, prevents it from slipping out. From the chocks it hangs in a, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: slight festoon over the bows, and is then passed inside the boat again; and some, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516

Text: notched stick of a peculiar form, some two feet in length, which is perpendicularly, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516

Text: a rest for the wooden extremity of the harpoon, whose other naked, barbed end, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516

Text: the other may still retain a hold. It is a doubling of the chances. But it very often, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516

Text: upon receiving the ﬁrst iron, it becomes impossible for the harpooneer, however, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: lightning-like in his movements, to pitch the second iron into him. Nevertheless,, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: as the second iron is already conneed with the line, and the line is running,, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: hence that weapon must, at all events, be anticipatingly tossed out of the boat,, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516

Text: You observe that in the ordinary swimming position of the Sperm Whale, the, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: front of his head presents an almost wholly vertical plane to the water; you observe, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: that the lower part of that front slopes considerably backwards, so as to furnish, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: more of a retreat for the long socket which receives the boom-like lower jaw; you, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516

Text: as though your own mouth were entirely under your chin. Moreover you observe, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: that the whale has no external nose; and that what nose he has—his spout hole—is, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: on the top of his head; you observe that his eyes and ears are at the sides of his, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: head, nearly one third of his entire length from the front. Wherefore, you must, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516

Text: conveyance of air, and for several feet laid along, horizontally, just beneath the, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516

Text: whether this gas-pipe is also a water-pipe; in other words, whether the spout of, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: the Sperm Whale is the mere vapor of the exhaled breath, or whether that exhaled, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: breath is mixed with water taken in at the mouth, and discharged through the, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516

Text: peremptory command, “Stick to the boat, Pip, or by the Lord, I wont pick you up, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: if you jump; mind that. We can’t aﬀord to lose whales by the likes of you; a whale, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: would sell for thirty times what you would, Pip, in Alabama. Bear that in mind,, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: and don’t jump any more.“ Hereby perhaps Stubb indirely hinted, that though, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: man loved his fellow, yet man is a money-making animal, which propensity too, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516

Text: But we are all in the hands of the Gods; and Pip jumped again. It was under, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: very similar circumstances to the ﬁrst performance; but this time he did not breast, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: out the line; and hence, when the whale started to run, Pip was left behind on the, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
Text: sea, like a hurried traveller’s trunk. Alas! Stubb was but too true to his word. It, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516

Text: stretching away, all round, to the horizon, like gold-beater’s skin hammered out, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516

Text: unlike the custom of his own race, who, after embalming a dead warrior, stretched, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516

Text: cast adrift and fall all swooping to the sea. So Ahab’s proceedings in this matter, Font: AGaramondPro-Regular, Size: 10.909000396728516
