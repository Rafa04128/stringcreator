Text: Pavlovitch Karamazov, a land owner well known in our district, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: although he hardly spent a day of his life on his own estate—was, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: a strange type, yet one pretty frequently to be met with, a type, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: fact, and probably there have been not a few similar instances in, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: the last two or three generations. Adelaïda Ivanovna Miüsov's, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: action was similarly, no doubt, an echo of other people's ideas,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and was due to the irritation caused by lack of mental freedom., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: She wanted, perhaps, to show her feminine independence, to, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: override class distinctions and the despotism of her family. And, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: was one of the bold and ironical spirits of that progressive epoch,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: though he was, in fact, an ill-natured buffoon and nothing more., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: to make a career in one way or another. To attach himself to a, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: a unique case of the kind in the life of Fyodor Pavlovitch, who, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: her money up to twenty-five thousand roubles as soon as she, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: little village and the rather fine town house which formed part, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: of her dowry he did his utmost for a long time to transfer to his, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: name, by means of some deed of conveyance. He would probably, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: have succeeded, merely from her moral fatigue and desire to get, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: rid of him, and from the contempt and loathing he aroused by his, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: persistent and shameless importunity. But, fortunately, Adelaïda, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Ivanovna's family intervened and circumvented his greediness., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: It is known for a fact that frequent fights took place between, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: tempered, bold, dark-browed, impatient woman, possessed of, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: going into details too disgraceful for a husband to mention in, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: Pavlovitch, you seem so pleased in spite of your sorrow,”, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: scoffers said to him. Many even added that he was glad of a new, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: comic part in which to play the buffoon, and that it was simply to, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: make it funnier that he pretended to be unaware of his ludicrous, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: position. But, who knows, it may have been simplicity. At last, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: he succeeded in getting on the track of his runaway wife. The, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: poor woman turned out to be in Petersburg, where she had gone, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: with her divinity student, and where she had thrown herself into a, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: life of complete emancipation. Fyodor Pavlovitch at once began, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: bustling about, making preparations to go to Petersburg, with, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: [004], Font: Times-Roman, Size: 7.970099925994873

Text: entitled to fortify himself for the journey by another bout of reck-, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: less drinking. And just at that time his wife's family received the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: news of her death in Petersburg. She had died quite suddenly in, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: a garret, according to one story, of typhus, or as another version, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: had it, of starvation. Fyodor Pavlovitch was drunk when he heard, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: of his wife's death, and the story is that he ran out into the street, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and began shouting with joy, raising his hands to Heaven: “Lord,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: now lettest Thou Thy servant depart in peace,” but others say he, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: wept without restraint like a little child, so much so that people, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: were sorry for him, in spite of the repulsion he inspired. It is, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: quite possible that both versions were true, that he rejoiced at his, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: up in the belief that he had property, and that he would be, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: independent on coming of age. He spent an irregular boyhood, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and youth. He did not finish his studies at the gymnasium, he got, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: into a military school, then went to the Caucasus, was promoted,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: fought a duel, and was degraded to the ranks, earned promotion, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: again, led a wild life, and spent a good deal of money. He, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: did not begin to receive any income from Fyodor Pavlovitch, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: until he came of age, and until then got into debt. He saw and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: knew his father, Fyodor Pavlovitch, for the first time on coming, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: of age, when he visited our neighborhood on purpose to settle, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: with him about his property. He seems not to have liked his, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: away, having only succeeded in obtaining a sum of money, and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: entering into an agreement for future payments from the estate,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: of the revenues and value of which he was unable (a fact worthy, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: Fyodor Pavlovitch remarked for the first time then (this, too,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: [007], Font: Times-Roman, Size: 7.970099925994873
Text: of his property. Fyodor Pavlovitch was very well satisfied with, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: this, as it fell in with his own designs. He gathered only that the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: young man was frivolous, unruly, of violent passions, impatient,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: 9, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and dissipated, and that if he could only obtain ready money he, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: would be satisfied, although only, of course, for a short time. So, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Fyodor Pavlovitch began to take advantage of this fact, sending, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: him from time to time small doles, installments. In the end, when, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: our little town to settle up once for all with his father, it turned, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: out to his amazement that he had nothing, that it was difficult, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: to get an account even, that he had received the whole value, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: of his property in sums of money from Fyodor Pavlovitch, and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: was perhaps even in debt to him, that by various agreements, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: into which he had, of his own desire, entered at various previous, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: dates, he had no right to expect anything more, and so on, and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: people's charity, and that their father was a man of whom it was, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: infancy (so they say at least), to show a brilliant and unusual, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: the first two years at the university, as he was forced to keep, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: not even attempt to communicate with his father, perhaps from, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: pride, from contempt for him, or perhaps from his cool common, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: notice, on a subject of which he might have been supposed to, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: know nothing, as he was a student of natural science. The article, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: dealt with a subject which was being debated everywhere at the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: some sagacious persons opined that the article was nothing but an, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: impudent satirical burlesque. I mention this incident particularly, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: because this article penetrated into the famous monastery in our, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: en. First of all, I must explain that this young man, Alyosha, was, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: not a fanatic, and, in my opinion at least, was not even a mystic., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: [014], Font: Times-Roman, Size: 7.970099925994873
Text: I may as well give my full opinion from the beginning. He, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: was simply an early lover of humanity, and that he adopted the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: monastic life was simply because at that time it struck him, so to, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: 17, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: of worldly wickedness to the light of love. And the reason this life, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: struck him in this way was that he found in it at that time, as he, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: thought, an extraordinary being, our celebrated elder, Zossima,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: to whom he became attached with all the warm first love of his, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: ardent heart. But I do not dispute that he was very strange even, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: at that time, and had been so indeed from his cradle. I have, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: mentioned already, by the way, that though he lost his mother, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: in his fourth year he remembered her all his life—her face, her, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: caresses, “as though she stood living before me.” Such memories, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: may persist, as every one knows, from an even earlier age, even, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: from two years old, but scarcely standing out through a whole, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: lifetime like spots of light out of darkness, like a corner torn out, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: of a huge picture, which has all faded and disappeared except, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: that fragment. That is how it was with him. He remembered one, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: still summer evening, an open window, the slanting rays of the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: setting sun (that he recalled most vividly of all); in a corner of the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: room the holy image, before it a lighted lamp, and on her knees, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: before the image his mother, sobbing hysterically with cries and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: moans, snatching him up in both arms, squeezing him close till it, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: hurt, and praying for him to the Mother of God, holding him out, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: in both arms to the image as though to put him under the Mother's, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: protection ... and suddenly a nurse runs in and snatches him from, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: her in terror. That was the picture! And Alyosha remembered, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: his mother's face at that minute. He used to say that it was, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: frenzied but beautiful as he remembered. But he rarely cared to, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: speak of this memory to any one. In his childhood and youth, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: he was by no means expansive, and talked little indeed, but not, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: from shyness or a sullen unsociability; quite the contrary, from, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: something different, from a sort of inner preoccupation entirely, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: personal and unconcerned with other people, but so important, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: to him that he seemed, as it were, to forget others on account, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: of it. But he was fond of people: he seemed throughout his life, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: to put implicit trust in people: yet no one ever looked on him, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: as a simpleton or naïve person. There was something about him, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: that he did, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: [015], Font: Times-Roman, Size: 7.970099925994873
Text: never take it upon himself to criticize and would never condemn, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: without the least condemnation though often grieving bitterly:, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and this was so much so that no one could surprise or frighten, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: on was unbearable, but without the slightest sign of contempt or, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: position, and so was sensitive and ready to take offense, met him, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: at first with distrust and sullenness. “He does not say much,” he, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: used to say, “and thinks the more.” But soon, within a fortnight, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: indeed, he took to embracing him and kissing him terribly often,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: with drunken tears, with sottish sentimentality, yet he evidently, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: felt a real and deep affection for him, such as he had never been, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: When he entered, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: the household of his patron and benefactor, Yefim Petrovitch, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Polenov, he gained the hearts of all the family, so that they, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: looked on him quite as their own child. Yet he entered the house, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: at such a tender age that he could not have acted from design, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: nor artfulness in winning affection. So that the gift of making, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: himself loved directly and unconsciously was inherent in him, in, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: his very nature, so to speak. It was the same at school, though, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: and yet he was a general favorite all the while he was at school., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: He was rarely playful or merry, but any one could see at the first, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: 19, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: he was bright and good-tempered. He never tried to show off, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: among his schoolfellows. Perhaps because of this, he was never, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: afraid of any one, yet the boys immediately understood that he, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: was not proud of his fearlessness and seemed to be unaware that, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: forgiven the affront, but simply that he did not regard it as an af-, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: and certain conversations about women., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: There are “certain”, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: words and conversations unhappily impossible to eradicate in, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: it, and it is often looked upon among them as something refined,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: subtle, daring, and worthy of imitation. Seeing that Alyosha, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Karamazov put his fingers in his ears when they talked of “that,”, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: to the floor, tried to hide himself without uttering one word of, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: abuse, enduring their insults in silence. But at last they left him, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: alone and gave up taunting him with being a “regular girl,” and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: buffoon showed an insolent propensity for making buffoons of, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: others. His depravity with women was not simply what it used, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: to be, but even more revolting. In a short time he opened a, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: which had long been dead in his soul., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: “Do you know,” he used often to say, looking at Alyosha,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: “that you are like her, ‘the crazy woman’ ”—that was what he, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: who pointed out the “crazy woman's” grave to Alyosha. He took, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: on old-fashioned middle-class tombs. To Alyosha's amazement, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: this tomb turned out to be Grigory's doing. He had put it up, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: unmistakably to the life he had led. Besides the long fleshy, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: the Adam's apple hung below his sharp chin like a great, fleshy, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: add to that a long rapacious mouth with full lips, between which, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: could be seen little stumps of black decayed teeth. He slobbered, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: fun of his own face, though, I believe, he was well satisfied, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: with it. He used particularly to point to his nose, which was, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: not very large, but very delicate and conspicuously aquiline. “A, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: Not long after visiting his mother's grave Alyosha suddenly, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: realist, if he is an unbeliever, will always find strength and ability, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: to disbelieve in the miraculous, and if he is confronted with a, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: miracle as an irrefutable fact he would rather disbelieve his own, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: senses than admit the fact. Even if he admits it, he admits it as, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: a fact of nature till then unrecognized by him. Faith does not,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: in the realist, spring from the miracle but the miracle from faith., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: If the realist once believes, then he is bound by his very realism, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: to admit the miraculous also. The Apostle Thomas said that he, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: would not believe till he saw, but when he did see he said, “My, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Lord and my God!” Was it the miracle forced him to believe?, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Most likely not, but he believed solely because he desired to, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: believe and possibly he fully believed in his secret heart even, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: I shall be told, perhaps, that Alyosha was stupid, undeveloped,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: his studies is true, but to say that he was stupid or dull would be, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: a great injustice. I'll simply repeat what I have said above. He, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: entered upon this path only because, at that time, it alone struck, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: that he was to some extent a youth of our last epoch—that is,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: his soul, seeking for immediate action, and ready to sacrifice, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: everything, life itself, for it. Though these young men unhappily, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: fail to understand that the sacrifice of life is, in many cases, the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: easiest of all sacrifices, and that to sacrifice, for instance, five, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: cause they have set before them as their goal—such a sacrifice is, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: utterly beyond the strength of many of them. The path Alyosha, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: chose was a path going in the opposite direction, but he chose, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: it with the same thirst for swift achievement. As soon as he, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: reflected seriously he was convinced of the existence of God and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: immortality, and at once he instinctively said to himself: “I want, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: to live for immortality, and I will accept no compromise.” In the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: same way, if he had decided that God and immortality did not, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: exist, he would at once have become an atheist and a socialist., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: For socialism is not merely the labor question, it is before all, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: God, not to mount to heaven from earth but to set up heaven on, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: earth. Alyosha would have found it strange and impossible to go, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: on living as before. It is written: “Give all that thou hast to the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: poor and follow Me, if thou wouldst be perfect.”, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: ‘all,’ and only go to mass instead of ‘following Him.’ ” Perhaps, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: his memories of childhood brought back our monastery, to which, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: monasteries only, and has sometimes been almost persecuted as, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: an innovation in Russia. It flourished especially in the celebrated, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Kozelski Optin Monastery. When and how it was introduced, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: into our monastery I cannot say. There had already been three, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: such elders and Zossima was the last of them. But he was almost, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: is not founded on theory, but was established in the East from, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: the practice of a thousand years. The obligations due to an elder, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: learnt that this holy man had broken his vow of obedience and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: here is a recent instance., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: A monk was suddenly commanded by his elder to quit Athos,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: which he loved as a sacred place and a haven of refuge, and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: to go first to Jerusalem to do homage to the Holy Places and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: then to go to the north to Siberia: “There is the place for thee, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and not here.” The monk, overwhelmed with sorrow, went to, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: the Œcumenical Patriarch at Constantinople and besought him, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: to release him from his obedience. But the Patriarch replied that, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: not only was he unable to release him, but there was not and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: the people. Masses of the ignorant people as well as men of, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: distinction flocked, for instance, to the elders of our monastery to, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: confess their doubts, their sins, and their sufferings, and ask for, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: counsel and admonition. Seeing this, the opponents of the elders, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: declared that the sacrament of confession was being arbitrarily, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and frivolously degraded, though the continual opening of the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: by the fact that Father Zossima was not at all stern. On the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: months in the town, though they had met fairly often, they were, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: still not intimate. Alyosha was naturally silent, and he seemed, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: to be expecting something, ashamed about something, while his, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: and curiously at him, seemed soon to have left off thinking of, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: his brother's indifference at first to the disparity of their age and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: education. But he also wondered whether the absence of curiosity, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and sympathy in Ivan might be due to some other cause entirely, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: unknown to him., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: He kept fancying that Ivan was absorbed, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: in something—something inward and important—that he was, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: striving towards some goal, perhaps very hard to attain, and that, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: that was why he had no thought for him. Alyosha wondered,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: too, whether there was not some contempt on the part of the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: learned atheist for him—a foolish novice. He knew for certain, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: he did not himself understand, he waited for his brother to come, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: more decently come to an understanding under the conciliating, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: influence of the elder's presence. Dmitri, who had never seen the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: elder, naturally supposed that his father was trying to intimidate, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: him, but, as he secretly blamed himself for his outbursts of, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: temper with his father on several recent occasions, he accepted, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: the challenge. It must be noted that he was not, like Ivan, staying, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: with his father, but living apart at the other end of the town. It, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: happened that Pyotr Alexandrovitch Miüsov, who was staying, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: in the district at the time, caught eagerly at the idea. A Liberal, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: of the forties and fifties, a freethinker and atheist, he may have, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: been led on by boredom or the hope of frivolous diversion. He, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: was suddenly seized with the desire to see the monastery and the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: holy man. As his lawsuit with the monastery still dragged on, he, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: made it the pretext for seeing the Superior, in order to attempt to, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: settle it amicably. A visitor coming with such laudable intentions, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: might be received with more attention and consideration than, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: his, a young man of twenty, called Pyotr Fomitch Kalganov. This, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: still undecided. He was thoughtful and absent-minded. He was, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: nice-looking, strongly built, and rather tall. There was a strange, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: fixity in his gaze at times. Like all very absent-minded people he, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: would sometimes stare at a person without seeing him. He was, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: silent and rather awkward, but sometimes, when he was alone, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: They had been told that the elder was at last coming out, and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: lively black eyes. She was not more than thirty-three, and had, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: been five years a widow. Her daughter, a girl of fourteen, was, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: to the peasants who were crowded at the foot of the three steps, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: I do not know how it may be now, but in my childhood I, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: led up to it, at once the “possession” ceased, and the sick women, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: were always soothed for a time. I was greatly impressed and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: amazed at this as a child; but then I heard from country neighbors, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and from my town teachers that the whole illness was simulated, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: of being a member of the Church and sinks into despair. If he, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: no law of nature that man should love mankind, and that, if there, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: had been any love on earth hitherto, it was not owing to a natural, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: relinquish his claims to the wood-cutting and fishery rights at, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: where the wood and river in question were., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: These excellent intentions were strengthened when he entered, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: the Father Superior's dining-room, though, strictly speaking, it, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: was not a dining-room, for the Father Superior had only two, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: rooms altogether; they were, however, much larger and more, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: comfortable than Father Zossima's. But there was no great luxury, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: of mahogany, covered with leather, in the old-fashioned style of, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: with cleanliness, and there were many choice flowers in the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: windows; the most sumptuous thing in the room at the moment, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: was, of course, the beautifully decorated table. The cloth was, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: clean, the service shone; there were three kinds of well-baked, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: he already had a footing. He had a footing everywhere, and got, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: he would play a prominent part of some sort, but Alyosha, who, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: Rakitin, of course, was a person of too little consequence to, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: be invited to the dinner, to which Father Iosif, Father Païssy, and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: They were already waiting when Miüsov, Kalganov, and Ivan, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: arrived. The other guest, Maximov, stood a little aside, waiting, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: also. The Father Superior stepped into the middle of the room to, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: with black hair streaked with gray, and a long, grave, ascetic, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: approached to receive his blessing. Miüsov even tried to kiss his, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: he felt it would be unseemly to go to dinner. Yet his creaking, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: he had hardly got into it, when he suddenly stopped short. He, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: The Karamazovs' house was far from being in the center of the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: town, but it was not quite outside it. It was a pleasant-looking old, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: house of two stories, painted gray, with a red iron roof. It was, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: roomy and snug, and might still last many years. There were all, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: sorts of unexpected little cupboards and closets and staircases., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: There were rats in it, but Fyodor Pavlovitch did not altogether, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: dislike them. “One doesn't feel so solitary when one's left alone, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: in the evening,” he used to say. It was his habit to send the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: servants away to the lodge for the night and to lock himself up, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: alone. The lodge was a roomy and solid building in the yard., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Fyodor Pavlovitch used to have the cooking done there, although, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: there was a kitchen in the house; he did not like the smell of, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: cooking, and, winter and summer alike, the dishes were carried, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: in across the courtyard. The house was built for a large family;, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: there was room for five times as many, with their servants. But, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: at the time of our story there was no one living in the house but, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Fyodor Pavlovitch and his son Ivan. And in the lodge there were, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: only three servants: old Grigory, and his old wife Marfa, and a, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: young man called Smerdyakov. Of these three we must say a, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: few words. Of old Grigory we have said something already. He, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: was firm and determined and went blindly and obstinately for his, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: object, if once he had been brought by any reasons (and they were, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: often very illogical ones) to believe that it was immutably right., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: He was honest and incorruptible. His wife, Marfa Ignatyevna,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: had obeyed her husband's will implicitly all her life, yet she, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: had pestered him terribly after the emancipation of the serfs., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: She was set on leaving Fyodor Pavlovitch and opening a little, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: master, whatever he might be, for “that was now their duty.”, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: “Do you understand what duty is?” he asked Marfa Ignatyevna., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: “I understand what duty means, Grigory Vassilyevitch, but, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: why it's our duty to stay here I never shall understand,” Marfa, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: And so it was. They did not go away, and Fyodor Pavlovitch, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: promised them a small sum for wages, and paid it regularly., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Grigory knew, too, that he had an indisputable influence over his, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: master. It was true, and he was aware of it. Fyodor Pavlovitch, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: strong enough “in some of the affairs of life,” as he expressed, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: it, he found himself, to his surprise, extremely feeble in facing, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: certain other emergencies. He knew his weaknesses and was, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: afraid of them. There are positions in which one has to keep, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: a sharp look out., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: And that's not easy without a trustworthy, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: might call him in his sick moments merely to look at his face, or,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: perhaps, exchange some quite irrelevant words with him. And, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: if the old servant were not angry, he felt comforted, and if he, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: were angry, he was more dejected. It happened even (very rarely, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: however) that Fyodor Pavlovitch went at night to the lodge to, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: wake Grigory and fetch him for a moment. When the old man, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: came, Fyodor Pavlovitch would begin talking about the most, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: trivial matters, and would soon let him go again, sometimes, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: As long as the sickly infant lived he scarcely looked at it, tried, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: indeed not to notice it, and for the most part kept out of the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: Lent. He was fond of the Book of Job, and had somehow got, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: hold of a copy of the sayings and sermons of “the God-fearing, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: together, understanding very little of it, but perhaps prizing and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: loving it the more for that. Of late he had begun to listen to the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: doctrines of the sect of Flagellants settled in the neighborhood., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: He was evidently shaken by them, but judged it unfitting to go, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: over to the new faith. His habit of theological reading gave him, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: an expression of still greater gravity., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: thought it was more like some one groaning, “it might be a wom-, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: As he went down the steps, he distinctly heard groans coming, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: from the garden. But the gate from the yard into the garden was, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: locked at night, and there was no other way of entering it, for, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: it was enclosed all round by a strong, high fence. Going back, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: into the house, Grigory lighted a lantern, took the garden key,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and taking no notice of the hysterical fears of his wife, who was, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: still persuaded that she heard a child crying, and that it was her, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: There was one circumstance which struck Grigory particularly,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and confirmed a very unpleasant and revolting suspicion. This, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Lizaveta was a dwarfish creature, “not five foot within a wee, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: idiocy and the fixed stare in her eyes was unpleasant, in spite of, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: their meek expression. She wandered about, summer and winter, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: alike, barefooted, wearing nothing but a hempen smock. Her, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: coarse, almost black hair curled like lamb's wool, and formed a, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: mother had long been dead. Spiteful and diseased, Ilya used to, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: beat Lizaveta inhumanly whenever she returned to him. But she, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: rarely did so, for every one in the town was ready to look after her, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: as being an idiot, and so specially dear to God. Ilya's employers,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: to clothe her better, and always rigged her out with high boots, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: making a tour of inspection in our town, saw Lizaveta, and was, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: wounded in his tenderest susceptibilities. And though he was, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: told she was an idiot, he pronounced that for a young woman, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: of twenty to wander about in nothing but a smock was a breach, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: of the proprieties, and must not occur again. But the governor, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: went his way, and Lizaveta was left as she was. At last her, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: father died, which made her even more acceptable in the eyes of, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: the religious persons of the town, as an orphan. In fact, every, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: away. Every one was kind to her and gave her something. If she, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: were given a copper, she would take it, and at once drop it in, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: the alms-jug of the church or prison. If she were given a roll or, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: Sometimes she would stop one of the richest ladies in the town, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and give it to her, and the lady would be pleased to take it. She, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: if she saw thousands of roubles overlooked by them, she would, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: not have touched a farthing. She scarcely ever went to church., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: They stopped to look at her, laughing, and began jesting with, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: unbridled licentiousness. It occurred to one young gentleman, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: to make the whimsical inquiry whether any one could possibly, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: look upon such an animal as a woman, and so forth.... They all, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: Fyodor Pavlovitch, who was among them, sprang forward and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: declared that it was by no means impossible, and that, indeed,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: terms, of course, though in reality he was on a servile footing, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: with them. It was just at the time when he had received the news, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: of his first wife's death in Petersburg, and, with crape upon his, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: reckless among us were shocked at the sight of him. The revelers,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: of course, laughed at this unexpected opinion; and one of them, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: Of course this was no great grievance to him: he would not have, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: “It's the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: dangerous convict, who had escaped from prison and whose, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: name was well known to us, as he had hidden in our town. This, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: conjecture sounded plausible, for it was remembered that Karp, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: had been in the neighborhood just at that time in the autumn,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: about it did not estrange popular sympathy from the poor idiot., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: She was better looked after than ever. A well-to-do merchant's, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: widow named Kondratyev arranged to take her into her house, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: at the end of April, meaning not to let her go out until after the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: confinement. They kept a constant watch over her, but in spite, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: of their vigilance she escaped on the very last day, and made, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: her way into Fyodor Pavlovitch's garden. How, in her condition,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: she managed to climb over the high, strong fence remained a, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: mystery. Some maintained that she must have been lifted over by, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: somebody; others hinted at something more uncanny. The most, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: likely explanation is that it happened naturally—that Lizaveta,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: somehow managed to climb this fence, in spite of her condition,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and had leapt down, injuring herself., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Grigory rushed to Marfa and sent her to Lizaveta, while he, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: ran to fetch an old midwife who lived close by. They saved the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: baby, but Lizaveta died at dawn. Grigory took the baby, brought, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: it home, and making his wife sit down, put it on her lap. “A child, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: of God—an orphan is akin to all,” he said, “and to us above, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: So Marfa brought up the child. He was christened Pavel,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: to which people were not slow in adding Fyodorovitch (son of, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Fyodor). Fyodor Pavlovitch did not object to any of this, and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: thought it amusing, though he persisted vigorously in denying his, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: responsibility. The townspeople were pleased at his adopting the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: foundling. Later on, Fyodor Pavlovitch invented a surname for, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: the child, calling him Smerdyakov, after his mother's nickname., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: that his father's shouts, commanding him to return home “with, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: Next day, of course, when he was sober, he regretted the broken, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: cups and saucers. Alyosha knew that his father would let him, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: [107], Font: Times-Roman, Size: 7.970099925994873
Text: Moreover, he was fully persuaded that his father might hurt any, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: one else, but would not hurt him. Alyosha was certain that no, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: one in the whole world ever would want to hurt him, and, what, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: is more, he knew that no one could hurt him. This was for him, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: an axiom, assumed once for all without question, and he went, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: his way without hesitation, relying on it., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: But at that moment an anxiety of a different sort disturbed, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: him, and worried him the more because he could not formulate, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: it. It was the fear of a woman, of Katerina Ivanovna, who had, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: so urgently entreated him in the note handed to him by Madame, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Hohlakov to come and see her about something. This request, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and the necessity of going had at once aroused an uneasy feeling, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: all the morning in spite of the scenes at the hermitage and at, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: the Father Superior's. He was not uneasy because he did not, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: know what she would speak of and what he must answer. And, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: he was not afraid of her simply as a woman. Though he knew, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: little of women, he had spent his life, from early childhood till, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: he entered the monastery, entirely with women. He was afraid of, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: that woman, Katerina Ivanovna. He had been afraid of her from, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: the first time he saw her. He had only seen her two or three times,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and had only chanced to say a few words to her. He thought of, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: 123, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: her as a beautiful, proud, imperious girl. It was not her beauty, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: which troubled him, but something else. And the vagueness of, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: his apprehension increased the apprehension itself. The girl's, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: aims were of the noblest, he knew that. She was trying to save his, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: brother Dmitri simply through generosity, though he had already, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: behaved badly to her. Yet, although Alyosha recognized and did, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: justice to all these fine and generous sentiments, a shiver began, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: to run down his back as soon as he drew near her house., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: He reflected that he would not find Ivan, who was so intimate, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: a friend, with her, for Ivan was certainly now with his father., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Dmitri he was even more certain not to find there, and he had, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: a foreboding of the reason. And so his conversation would be, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: with her alone. He had a great longing to run and see his brother, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Dmitri before that fateful interview. Without showing him the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: letter, he could talk to him about it. But Dmitri lived a long way, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: off, and he was sure to be away from home too. Standing still, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: for a minute, he reached a final decision. Crossing himself with, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: [108], Font: Times-Roman, Size: 7.970099925994873
Text: a rapid and accustomed gesture, and at once smiling, he turned, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: resolutely in the direction of his terrible lady., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: He knew her house. If he went by the High Street and then, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: across the market-place, it was a long way round. Though our, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: town is small, it is scattered, and the houses are far apart. And, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: meanwhile his father was expecting him, and perhaps had not, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: yet forgotten his command. He might be unreasonable, and so he, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: had to make haste to get there and back. So he decided to take a, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: short cut by the back-way, for he knew every inch of the ground., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: This meant skirting fences, climbing over hurdles, and crossing, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: other people's back-yards, where every one he met knew him and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: him a salary, almost the whole of which Smerdyakov spent on, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: clothes, pomade, perfumes, and such things. But he seemed to, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: have as much contempt for the female sex as for men; he was, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: discreet, almost unapproachable, with them. Fyodor Pavlovitch, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: hastening to search his pockets when he saw the notes lying on, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: “Well, my lad, I've never met any one like you,” Fyodor, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: entered the very spacious and convenient house in the High Street, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: occupied by Katerina Ivanovna. Alyosha knew that she lived, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: with two aunts. One of them, a woman of little education, was, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: her in her father's house when she came from boarding-school., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: The other aunt was a Moscow lady of style and consequence,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: though in straitened circumstances. It was said that they both, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: gave way in everything to Katerina Ivanovna, and that she only, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: kept them with her as chaperons. Katerina Ivanovna herself gave, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: way to no one but her benefactress, the general's widow, who had, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: been kept by illness in Moscow, and to whom she was obliged, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: to write twice a week a full account of all her doings., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: When Alyosha entered the hall and asked the maid who opened, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: the door to him to take his name up, it was evident that they were, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: already aware of his arrival. Possibly he had been noticed from, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: the window. At least, Alyosha heard a noise, caught the sound, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: of flying footsteps and rustling skirts. Two or three women,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: perhaps, had run out of the room., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Alyosha thought it strange that his arrival should cause such, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: excitement. He was conducted however to the drawing-room at, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: once. It was a large room, elegantly and amply furnished, not at, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: all in provincial style. There were many sofas, lounges, settees,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: big and little tables. There were pictures on the walls, vases and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: lamps on the tables, masses of flowers, and even an aquarium, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: in the window. It was twilight and rather dark. Alyosha made, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: out a silk mantle thrown down on the sofa, where people had, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: The Brothers Karamazov, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: evidently just been sitting; and on a table in front of the sofa were, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: two unfinished cups of chocolate, cakes, a glass saucer with blue, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: raisins, and another with sweetmeats. Alyosha saw that he had, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: interrupted visitors, and frowned. But at that instant the portière, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: was raised, and with rapid, hurrying footsteps Katerina Ivanovna, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: came in, holding out both hands to Alyosha with a radiant smile, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: of delight. At the same instant a servant brought in two lighted, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: candles and set them on the table., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: “Thank God! At last you have come too! I've been simply, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: praying for you all day! Sit down.”, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Alyosha had been struck by Katerina Ivanovna's beauty when,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: three weeks before, Dmitri had first brought him, at Katerina, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Ivanovna's special request, to be introduced to her. There had, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: been no conversation between them at that interview, however., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Supposing Alyosha to be very shy, Katerina Ivanovna had talked, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: [158], Font: Times-Roman, Size: 7.970099925994873
Text: all the time to Dmitri to spare him. Alyosha had been silent,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: but he had seen a great deal very clearly. He was struck by the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: imperiousness, proud ease, and self-confidence of the haughty, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: girl. And all that was certain, Alyosha felt that he was not exag-, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: gerating it. He thought her great glowing black eyes were very, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: fine, especially with her pale, even rather sallow, longish face., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: But in those eyes and in the lines of her exquisite lips there was, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: something with which his brother might well be passionately, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: in love, but which perhaps could not be loved for long. He, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: expressed this thought almost plainly to Dmitri when, after the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: visit, his brother besought and insisted that he should not conceal, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: his impressions on seeing his betrothed., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: “You'll be happy with her, but perhaps—not tranquilly happy.”, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: “Quite so, brother. Such people remain always the same. They, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: don't yield to fate. So you think I shan't love her for ever.”, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: “No; perhaps you will love her for ever. But perhaps you, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: won't always be happy with her.”, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Alyosha had given his opinion at the time, blushing, and angry, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: 181, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: put such “foolish” ideas into words. For his opinion had struck, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: him as awfully foolish immediately after he had uttered it. He, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: felt ashamed too of having given so confident an opinion about, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: a woman. It was with the more amazement that he felt now, at, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: the first glance at Katerina Ivanovna as she ran in to him, that, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: he had perhaps been utterly mistaken. This time her face was, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: beaming with spontaneous good-natured kindliness, and direct, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: warm-hearted sincerity., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: The “pride and haughtiness,” which, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: had struck Alyosha so much before, was only betrayed now in, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: a frank, generous energy and a sort of bright, strong faith in, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: herself. Alyosha realized at the first glance, at the first word, that, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: all the tragedy of her position in relation to the man she loved, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: so dearly was no secret to her; that she perhaps already knew, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: everything, positively everything. And yet, in spite of that, there, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: was such brightness in her face, such faith in the future. Alyosha, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: felt at once that he had gravely wronged her in his thoughts., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: He was conquered and captivated immediately. Besides all this,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: he noticed at her first words that she was in great excitement,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: an excitement perhaps quite exceptional and almost approaching, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: “Help me now, Alexey Fyodorovitch. Now I really need your, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: and delicately nestling her milk-white neck and broad shoulders, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: in a costly cashmere shawl. She was twenty-two years old, and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: her face looked exactly that age. She was very white in the face,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: with a pale pink tint on her cheeks. The modeling of her face, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: of childlike good nature. There was a childlike look in her eyes,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: a look of childish delight. She came up to the table, beaming, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: which he could not understand, or would not have been able to, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: Under the shawl could be seen full broad shoulders, a high, still, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: though he was fascinated, yet he wondered with an unpleasant, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: his cell apart, behind the apiary, and had been greatly impressed, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: whole institution of “elders,” which he regarded as a pernicious, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: although from his practice of silence he scarcely spoke a word, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: before them—which men brought to the monastery as offerings, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: to God. Father Ferapont had been appointed to look after them, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and keep the lamps burning. It was said (and indeed it was true), Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: that he ate only two pounds of bread in three days. The beekeep-, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: er, who lived close by the apiary, used to bring him the bread, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: after the late mass by the Father Superior, made up his weekly, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: rations. The water in his jug was changed every day. He rarely, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: appeared at mass. Visitors who came to do him homage saw him, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: [181], Font: Times-Roman, Size: 7.970099925994873
Text: If he addressed them, he was brief, abrupt, strange, and almost, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: always rude. On very rare occasions, however, he would talk to, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: visitors, but for the most part he would utter some one strange, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: saying which was a complete riddle, and no entreaties would, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: induce him to pronounce a word in explanation. He was not a, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: priest, but a simple monk. There was a strange belief, chiefly, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: however among the most ignorant, that Father Ferapont had, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: The monk from Obdorsk, having been directed to the apiary, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: by the beekeeper, who was also a very silent and surly monk,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: went to the corner where Father Ferapont's cell stood. “Maybe, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: he will speak as you are a stranger and maybe you'll get nothing, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: out of him,” the beekeeper had warned him. The monk, as he, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: related afterwards, approached in the utmost apprehension. It, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: was rather late in the evening. Father Ferapont was sitting at the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: door of his cell on a low bench. A huge old elm was lightly, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: rustling overhead. There was an evening freshness in the air. The, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: monk from Obdorsk bowed down before the saint and asked his, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: blessing., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: “Do you want me to bow down to you, monk?” said Father, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Ferapont. “Get up!”, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: from?”, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: What most struck the poor monk was the fact that in spite, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: of his strict fasting and great age, Father Ferapont still looked, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: a vigorous old man. He was tall, held himself erect, and had a, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: thin, but fresh and healthy face. There was no doubt he still had, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: considerable strength. He was of athletic build. In spite of his, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: great age he was not even quite gray, and still had very thick, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: hair and a full beard, both of which had once been black. His, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: eyes were gray, large and luminous, but strikingly prominent. He, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: spoke with a broad accent. He was dressed in a peasant's long, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: reddish coat of coarse convict cloth (as it used to be called) and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: At the moment Alyosha and Madame Hohlakov entered, Ivan, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Fyodorovitch stood up to take leave. His face was rather pale, and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Alyosha looked at him anxiously. For this moment was to solve, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: a doubt, a harassing enigma which had for some time haunted, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Alyosha. During the preceding month it had been several times, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: suggested to him that his brother Ivan was in love with Katerina, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Ivanovna, and, what was more, that he meant “to carry her off”, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: from Dmitri., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Until quite lately the idea seemed to Alyosha, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: monstrous, though it worried him extremely. He loved both his, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: brothers, and dreaded such rivalry between them. Meantime,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Dmitri had said outright on the previous day that he was glad, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: that Ivan was his rival, and that it was a great assistance to him,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Dmitri. In what way did it assist him? To marry Grushenka?, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: But that Alyosha considered the worst thing possible. Besides, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: [203], Font: Times-Roman, Size: 7.970099925994873
Text: all this, Alyosha had till the evening before implicitly believed, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: that Katerina Ivanovna had a steadfast and passionate love for, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Dmitri; but he had only believed it till the evening before. He, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: had fancied, too, that she was incapable of loving a man like, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Ivan, and that she did love Dmitri, and loved him just as he was,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: in spite of all the strangeness of such a passion., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: But during yesterday's scene with Grushenka another idea had, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: struck him. The word “lacerating,” which Madame Hohlakov, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: towards daybreak that night he had cried out “Laceration, lacer-, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: ation,” probably applying it to his dream. He had been dreaming, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: all night of the previous day's scene at Katerina Ivanovna's. Now, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Alyosha was impressed by Madame Hohlakov's blunt and per-, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: sistent assertion that Katerina Ivanovna was in love with Ivan,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and only deceived herself through some sort of pose, from “self-, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: laceration,” and tortured herself by her pretended love for Dmitri, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: from some fancied duty of gratitude. “Yes,” he thought, “perhaps, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: the whole truth lies in those words.” But in that case what was, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Ivan's position? Alyosha felt instinctively that a character like, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Katerina Ivanovna's must dominate, and she could only dominate, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: some one like Dmitri, and never a man like Ivan. For Dmitri, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: might at last submit to her domination “to his own happiness”, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: (which was what Alyosha would have desired), but Ivan—no,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Ivan could not submit to her, and such submission would not give, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: him happiness. Alyosha could not help believing that of Ivan., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: And now all these doubts and reflections flitted through his mind, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: as he entered the drawing-room. Another idea, too, forced itself, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: upon him: “What if she loved neither of them—neither Ivan nor, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Dmitri?”, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: It must be noted that Alyosha felt as it were ashamed of, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: his own thoughts and blamed himself when they kept recurring, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: to him during the last month., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: “What do I know about love, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and women and how can I decide such questions?” he thought, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: reproachfully, after such doubts and surmises. And yet it was, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: impossible not to think about it. He felt instinctively that this, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: rivalry was of immense importance in his brothers' lives and that, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: a great deal depended upon it., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: “One reptile will devour the other,” Ivan had pronounced the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: looked upon Dmitri as a reptile, and perhaps had long done so., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Was it perhaps since he had known Katerina Ivanovna? That, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: Alyosha to sympathize? And what was he to wish for each of, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: in this maze, and Alyosha's heart could not endure uncertainty,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: because his love was always of an active character. He was, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: incapable of passive love. If he loved any one, he set to work, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: at once to help him. And to do so he must know what he was, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: aiming at; he must know for certain what was best for each, and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: having ascertained this it was natural for him to help them both., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: But instead of a definite aim, he found nothing but uncertainty, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and perplexity on all sides. “It was lacerating,” as was said just, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: did not understand the first word in this perplexing maze., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Seeing Alyosha, Katerina Ivanovna said quickly and joyfully, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: to Ivan, who had already got up to go, “A minute! Stay another, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: There was one point which interested him particularly about, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Katerina Ivanovna's commission; when she had mentioned the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: captain's son, the little schoolboy who had run beside his father, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: schoolboy who had bitten his finger when he, Alyosha, asked, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: certain of this, though he could not have said why. Thinking of, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: cabinet-maker, his son, and his old wife, looked with positive, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: Alyosha's persistent inquiries. Alyosha saw that he was answer-, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: ing in accordance with instructions. When he asked whether he, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: were not at Grushenka's or in hiding at Foma's (Alyosha spoke, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: so freely on purpose), all three looked at him in alarm. “They are, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: “That's good.”, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: At last he found the house in Lake Street. It was a decrepit, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: little house, sunk on one side, with three windows looking into, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: the street, and with a muddy yard, in the middle of which stood, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: a solitary cow. He crossed the yard and found the door opening, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: into the passage. On the left of the passage lived the old woman, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: [215], Font: Times-Roman, Size: 7.970099925994873
Text: of the house with her old daughter. Both seemed to be deaf. In, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: answer to his repeated inquiry for the captain, one of them at last, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: understood that he was asking for their lodgers, and pointed to a, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: door across the passage. The captain's lodging turned out to be a, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: simple cottage room. Alyosha had his hand on the iron latch to, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: open the door, when he was struck by the strange hush within., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Yet he knew from Katerina Ivanovna's words that the man had a, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: family. “Either they are all asleep or perhaps they have heard me, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: coming and are waiting for me to open the door. I'd better knock, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: first,” and he knocked. An answer came, but not at once, after an, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: interval of perhaps ten seconds., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: “Who's there?” shouted some one in a loud and very angry, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: voice., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Then Alyosha opened the door and crossed the threshold. He, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: found himself in a regular peasant's room. Though it was large, it, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: was cumbered up with domestic belongings of all sorts, and there, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: 246, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: The Brothers Karamazov, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: were several people in it. On the left was a large Russian stove., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: From the stove to the window on the left was a string running, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: across the room, and on it there were rags hanging. There was, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: a bedstead against the wall on each side, right and left, covered, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: with knitted quilts. On the one on the left was a pyramid of four, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: print-covered pillows, each smaller than the one beneath. On, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: the other there was only one very small pillow. The opposite, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: corner was screened off by a curtain or a sheet hung on a string., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Behind this curtain could be seen a bed made up on a bench and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: a chair. The rough square table of plain wood had been moved, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: into the middle window. The three windows, which consisted, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: each of four tiny greenish mildewy panes, gave little light, and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: were close shut, so that the room was not very light and rather, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: stuffy. On the table was a frying-pan with the remains of some, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: fried eggs, a half-eaten piece of bread, and a small bottle with a, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: few drops of vodka., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: A woman of genteel appearance, wearing a cotton gown, was, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: sitting on a chair by the bed on the left. Her face was thin and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: yellow, and her sunken cheeks betrayed at the first glance that, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: she was ill. But what struck Alyosha most was the expression in, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: the poor woman's eyes—a look of surprised inquiry and yet of, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: haughty pride. And while he was talking to her husband, her big, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: brown eyes moved from one speaker to the other with the same, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: haughty and questioning expression. Beside her at the window, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: [216], Font: Times-Roman, Size: 7.970099925994873
Text: stood a young girl, rather plain, with scanty reddish hair, poorly, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: but very neatly dressed. She looked disdainfully at Alyosha as he, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: came in. Beside the other bed was sitting another female figure., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: She was a very sad sight, a young girl of about twenty, but, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: hunchback and crippled “with withered legs,” as Alyosha was, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: told afterwards. Her crutches stood in the corner close by. The, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: strikingly beautiful and gentle eyes of this poor girl looked with, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: mild serenity at Alyosha. A man of forty-five was sitting at the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: table, finishing the fried eggs. He was spare, small and weakly, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: built. He had reddish hair and a scanty light-colored beard, very, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: 247, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: much like a wisp of tow (this comparison and the phrase “a wisp, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: of tow” flashed at once into Alyosha's mind for some reason, he, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: remembered it afterwards). It was obviously this gentleman who, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: had shouted to him, as there was no other man in the room. But, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: when Alyosha went in, he leapt up from the bench on which he, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: was sitting, and, hastily wiping his mouth with a ragged napkin,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: darted up to Alyosha., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: “It's a monk come to beg for the monastery. A nice place to, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: spun round instantly towards her and answered her in an excited, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and breaking voice:, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: “No, Varvara, you are wrong. Allow me to ask,” he turned, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: again to Alyosha, “what has brought you to—our retreat?”, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Alyosha looked attentively at him. It was the first time he had, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: seen him. There was something angular, flurried and irritable, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: about him. Though he had obviously just been drinking, he was, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: not drunk. There was extraordinary impudence in his expression,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and yet, strange to say, at the same time there was fear. He, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: looked like a man who had long been kept in subjection and had, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: submitted to it, and now had suddenly turned and was trying to, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: assert himself. Or, better still, like a man who wants dreadfully to, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: hit you but is horribly afraid you will hit him. In his words and in, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: the intonation of his shrill voice there was a sort of crazy humor,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: at times spiteful and at times cringing, and continually shifting, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: from one tone to another. The question about “our retreat” he, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: had asked as it were quivering all over, rolling his eyes, and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: skipping up so close to Alyosha that he instinctively drew back a, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: step. He was dressed in a very shabby dark cotton coat, patched, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: here and then no one will dare—’ Then he was silent and his lips, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: still kept trembling. ‘Father,’ he said, ‘what a horrid town this, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: us move into another town, a nice one,’ he said, ‘where people, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: ‘only I must save up for it.’ I was glad to be able to turn his, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: mind from painful thoughts, and we began to dream of how we, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: would move to another town, how we would buy a horse and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: morning, he came back depressed, terribly depressed. In the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: evening I took him by the hand and we went for a walk; he would, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: not talk. There was a wind blowing and no sun, and a feeling of, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: autumn; twilight was coming on. We walked along, both of us, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: depressed. ‘Well, my boy,’ said I, ‘how about our setting off on, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: my hand. Ah, I thought, it's a bad job; there's something fresh., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: We had reached the stone where we are now. I sat down on, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: [227], Font: Times-Roman, Size: 7.970099925994873

Text: just the season for the kites. ‘Look, Ilusha,’ said I, ‘it's time we, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: it away?’ My boy made no answer. He looked away and turned, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: sideways to me. And then a gust of wind blew up the sand. He, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: suddenly fell on me, threw both his little arms round my neck and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: and shook as though he were in convulsions, and squeezed up, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: against me as I sat on the stone. ‘Father,’ he kept crying, ‘dear, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: “Tell those who sent you that the wisp of tow does not sell, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: quickly and began to run; but he had not run five steps before he, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: when they take money, he might still endure to take it. But he, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: he is a good and truthful man—that's the worst of the whole, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: the situation he could get in another town.... And when he had, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: poured out his heart, he felt ashamed at having shown me his, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: inmost soul like that. So he began to hate me at once. He is one, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: of those awfully sensitive poor people. What had made him feel, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: most ashamed was that he had given in too soon and accepted, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: me as a friend, you see. At first he almost flew at me and tried, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: to intimidate me, but as soon as he saw the money he had begun, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: embracing me; he kept touching me with his hands. This must, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: have been how he came to feel it all so humiliating, and then, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: I made that blunder, a very important one. I suddenly said to, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: him that if he had not money enough to move to another town,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: we would give it to him, and, indeed, I myself would give him, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: as much as he wanted out of my own money. That struck him, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: all at once. Why, he thought, did I put myself forward to help, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: him? You know, Lise, it's awfully hard for a man who has been, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: injured, when other people look at him as though they were his, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: know how to put it, but I have often seen it myself. And I feel like, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: that myself, too. And the worst of it was that though he did not, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: that his right shoulder looked lower than his left. He had never, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: noticed it before. But all at once he turned too, and almost ran to, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: something new was growing up in him for which he could not ac-, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: the ancient pines murmured gloomily about him when he entered, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: The Brothers Karamazov, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: was nothing surprising at his feeling so at such a moment, when, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: he had broken off with everything that had brought him here,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and was preparing that day to make a new start and enter upon a, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: new, unknown future. He would again be as solitary as ever, and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: though he had great hopes, and great—too great—expectations, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: from life, he could not have given any definite account of his, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: hopes, his expectations, or even his desires., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Yet at that moment, though the apprehension of the new and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: unknown certainly found place in his heart, what was worrying, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: him was something quite different. “Is it loathing for my father's, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: house?” he wondered. “Quite likely; I am so sick of it; and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: though it's the last time I shall cross its hateful threshold, still I, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: loathe it.... No, it's not that either. Is it the parting with Alyosha, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and the conversation I had with him? For so many years I've, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: been silent with the whole world and not deigned to speak, and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: all of a sudden I reel off a rigmarole like that.” It certainly might, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: have been the youthful vexation of youthful inexperience and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: vanity—vexation at having failed to express himself, especially, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: with such a being as Alyosha, on whom his heart had certainly, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: been reckoning. No doubt that came in, that vexation, it must, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: have done indeed; but yet that was not it, that was not it either. “I, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: feel sick with depression and yet I can't tell what I want. Better, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: not think, perhaps.”, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Ivan tried “not to think,” but that, too, was no use. What made, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: his depression so vexatious and irritating was that it had a kind, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: of casual, external character—he felt that. Some person or thing, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: [293], Font: Times-Roman, Size: 7.970099925994873
Text: On a bench in the gateway the valet Smerdyakov was sitting, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: enjoying the coolness of the evening, and at the first glance at, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: him Ivan knew that the valet Smerdyakov was on his mind, and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: that it was this man that his soul loathed. It all dawned upon, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: him suddenly and became clear. Just before, when Alyosha had, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: been telling him of his meeting with Smerdyakov, he had felt a, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: sudden twinge of gloom and loathing, which had immediately, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: stirred responsive anger in his heart. Afterwards, as he talked,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Smerdyakov had been forgotten for the time; but still he had been, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: in his mind, and as soon as Ivan parted with Alyosha and was, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: walking home, the forgotten sensation began to obtrude itself, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: again. “Is it possible that a miserable, contemptible creature like, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: that can worry me so much?” he wondered, with insufferable, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: irritation., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: It was true that Ivan had come of late to feel an intense dislike, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: for the man, especially during the last few days. He had even, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: begun to notice in himself a growing feeling that was almost of, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: hatred for the creature. Perhaps this hatred was accentuated by, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: the fact that when Ivan first came to the neighborhood he had, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: felt quite differently. Then he had taken a marked interest in, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Smerdyakov, and had even thought him very original. He had, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: encouraged him to talk to him, although he had always won-, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: dered at a certain incoherence, or rather restlessness, in his mind,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and could not understand what it was that so continually and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: insistently worked upon the brain of “the contemplative.” They, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: discussed philosophical questions and even how there could have, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: stood. But Ivan soon saw that, though the sun, moon, and stars, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: might be an interesting subject, yet that it was quite secondary to, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Smerdyakov, and that he was looking for something altogether, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: vanity, and a wounded vanity, too, and that Ivan disliked. It had, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: first given rise to his aversion. Later on, there had been trouble in, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: the house. Grushenka had come on the scene, and there had been, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: consider—goodness knows why!—that there was some sort of, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: expressed on both sides, only known to them and beyond the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: he gave me in case anything unexpected happens. At first, two, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: knocks, and then, after an interval, another much louder. Then, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: he will understand that something has happened suddenly and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: that I must see him, and he will open to me so that I can go and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: speak to him. That's all in case Agrafena Alexandrovna can't, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: come herself, but sends a message. Besides, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: Fyodorovitch were to turn up anywhere near at the time, I should, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: be bound to let him know at once, knocking three times. So that, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: the first signal of five knocks means Agrafena Alexandrovna has, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: come, while the second signal of three knocks means ‘something, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: important to tell you.’ His honor has shown me them several, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: times and explained them. And as in the whole universe no one, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: knows of these signals but myself and his honor, so he'd open, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: the door without the slightest hesitation and without calling out, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: And in the same nervous frenzy, too, he spoke. Meeting Fyodor, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Pavlovitch in the drawing-room directly he went in, he shouted, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: to him, waving his hands, “I am going upstairs to my room, not, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: in to you. Good-by!” and passed by, trying not even to look at, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: his father. Very possibly the old man was too hateful to him at, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: that moment; but such an unceremonious display of hostility was, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: a surprise even to Fyodor Pavlovitch. And the old man evidently, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: wanted to tell him something at once and had come to meet, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: him in the drawing-room on purpose. Receiving this amiable, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: greeting, he stood still in silence and with an ironical air watched, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: just complained of to Ivan, all relating to his expected visitor,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and these questions we will omit. Half an hour later the house, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: was locked, and the crazy old man was wandering along through, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: the rooms in excited expectation of hearing every minute the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: darkness, seeing nothing., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: It was very late, but Ivan was still awake and reflecting. He, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: sat up late that night, till two o'clock. But we will not give an, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: account of his thoughts, and this is not the place to look into, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: that soul—its turn will come. And even if one tried, it would be, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: very hard to give an account of them, for there were no thoughts, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: in his brain, but something very vague, and, above all, intense, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: excitement. He felt himself that he had lost his bearings. He, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: 347, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: was fretted, too, by all sorts of strange and almost surprising, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: desires; for instance, after midnight he suddenly had an intense, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: irresistible inclination to go down, open the door, go to the lodge, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and beat Smerdyakov. But if he had been asked why, he could, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: not have given any exact reason, except perhaps that he loathed, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: the valet as one who had insulted him more gravely than any, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: one in the world. On the other hand, he was more than once, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: that night overcome by a sort of inexplicable humiliating terror,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: which he felt positively paralyzed his physical powers. His head, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: ached and he was giddy. A feeling of hatred was rankling in his, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: heart, as though he meant to avenge himself on some one. He, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: even hated Alyosha, recalling the conversation he had just had, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: with him. At moments he hated himself intensely. Of Katerina, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Ivanovna he almost forgot to think, and wondered greatly at this, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: afterwards, especially as he remembered perfectly that when he, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: had protested so valiantly to Katerina Ivanovna that he would go, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: away next day to Moscow, something had whispered in his heart,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: “That's nonsense, you are not going, and it won't be so easy to, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: tear yourself away as you are boasting now.”, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Remembering that night long afterwards, Ivan recalled with, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: peculiar repulsion how he had suddenly got up from the sofa, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and had stealthily, as though he were afraid of being watched,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: opened the door, gone out on the staircase and listened to Fyodor, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: [304], Font: Times-Roman, Size: 7.970099925994873
Text: five minutes—with a sort of strange curiosity, holding his breath, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: while his heart throbbed. And why he had done all this, why, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: he was listening, he could not have said. That “action” all his, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: life afterwards he called “infamous,” and at the bottom of his, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: heart, he thought of it as the basest action of his life. For Fyodor, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Pavlovitch himself he felt no hatred at that moment, but was, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: simply intensely curious to know how he was walking down, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: there below and what he must be doing now., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: He wondered, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and imagined how he must be peeping out of the dark windows, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and stopping in the middle of the room, listening, listening—for, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: like this., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: About two o'clock when everything was quiet, and even Fy-, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: resolved to fall asleep at once, as he felt fearfully exhausted., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: And he did fall asleep at once, and slept soundly without dreams,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: but waked early, at seven o'clock, when it was broad daylight., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Opening his eyes, he was surprised to feel himself extraordi-, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: narily vigorous. He jumped up at once and dressed quickly;, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: then dragged out his trunk and began packing immediately. His, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: Ivan positively smiled at the thought that everything was helping, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: his sudden departure. And his departure certainly was sudden., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Though Ivan had said the day before (to Katerina Ivanovna,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Alyosha, and Smerdyakov) that he was leaving next day, yet he, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: remembered that he had no thought of departure when he went, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: to bed, or, at least, had not dreamed that his first act in the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: morning would be to pack his trunk. At last his trunk and bag, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: were ready. It was about nine o'clock when Marfa Ignatyevna, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: came in with her usual inquiry, “Where will your honor take, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: your tea, in your own room or downstairs?” He looked almost, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: cheerful, but there was about him, about his words and gestures,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: something hurried and scattered. Greeting his father affably, and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: even inquiring specially after his health, though he did not wait, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: to hear his answer to the end, he announced that he was starting, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: off in an hour to return to Moscow for good, and begged him to, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: two pieces of copse land there. The Maslovs, an old merchant, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and his son, will give eight thousand for the timber. But last year, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: I just missed a purchaser who would have given twelve. There's, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: their own way. One has to take what they'll give, for no one here, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: dare bid against them. The priest at Ilyinskoe wrote to me last, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Thursday that a merchant called Gorstkin, a man I know, had, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: turned up. What makes him valuable is that he is not from these, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: parts, so he is not afraid of the Maslovs. He says he will give me, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: complaint. He is a liar. Sometimes he tells such lies that you, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: The old man was quite delighted. He wrote the note, and sent, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: for the horses. A light lunch was brought in, with brandy. When, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Fyodor Pavlovitch was pleased, he usually became expansive,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: but to-day he seemed to restrain himself. Of Dmitri, for instance,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: he did not say a word. He was quite unmoved by the parting,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and seemed, in fact, at a loss for something to say. Ivan noticed, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: this particularly. “He must be bored with me,” he thought. Only, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: when accompanying his son out on to the steps, the old man, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: began to fuss about. He would have kissed him, but Ivan made, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: haste to hold out his hand, obviously avoiding the kiss. His father, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: saw it at once, and instantly pulled himself up., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: “Well, good luck to you, good luck to you!” he repeated from, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: “You see ... I am going to Tchermashnya,” broke suddenly, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: from Ivan. Again, as the day before, the words seemed to drop of, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: themselves, and he laughed, too, a peculiar, nervous laugh. He, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: remembered it long after., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: “It's a true saying then, that ‘it's always worth while speak-, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: [308], Font: Times-Roman, Size: 7.970099925994873
Text: The carriage rolled away. Nothing was clear in Ivan's soul, but, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: he looked eagerly around him at the fields, at the hills, at the trees,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: at a flock of geese flying high overhead in the bright sky. And all, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: of a sudden he felt very happy. He tried to talk to the driver, and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: he felt intensely interested in an answer the peasant made him;, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: but a minute later he realized that he was not catching anything,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and that he had not really even taken in the peasant's answer. He, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: was silent, and it was pleasant even so. The air was fresh, pure, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and cool, the sky bright. The images of Alyosha and Katerina, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Ivanovna floated into his mind. But he softly smiled, blew softly, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: on the friendly phantoms, and they flew away. “There's plenty, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: of time for them,” he thought. They reached the station quickly,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: changed horses, and galloped to Volovya. “Why is it worth, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: while speaking to a clever man? What did he mean by that?”, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: The thought seemed suddenly to clutch at his breathing. “And, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: why did I tell him I was going to Tchermashnya?” They reached, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Volovya station. Ivan got out of the carriage, and the drivers, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: stood round him bargaining over the journey of twelve versts to, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Tchermashnya. He told them to harness the horses. He went into, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: the station house, looked round, glanced at the overseer's wife,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: “I won't go to Tchermashnya. Am I too late to reach the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: “Of course I can. I've known Fyodor Pavlovitch a long time.”, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: “And here's something for you, for I dare say he won't give, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: “You may depend on it he won't.” Mitya laughed too. “Thank, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: you, sir. I'll be sure to do it.”, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: At seven o'clock Ivan got into the train and set off to Moscow, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: “Away with the past. I've done with the old world for ever,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and may I have no news, no echo, from it. To a new life, new, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: [309], Font: Times-Roman, Size: 7.970099925994873
Text: filled with such gloom, and his heart ached with such anguish,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: as he had never known in his life before. He was thinking all, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: the night. The train flew on, and only at daybreak, when he, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: was approaching Moscow, he suddenly roused himself from his, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: meditation., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: “I am a scoundrel,” he whispered to himself., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Fyodor Pavlovitch remained well satisfied at having seen his, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: son off. For two hours afterwards he felt almost happy, and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: sat drinking brandy. But suddenly something happened which, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: was very annoying and unpleasant for every one in the house,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and completely upset Fyodor Pavlovitch's equanimity at once., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Smerdyakov went to the cellar for something and fell down from, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: the top of the steps. Fortunately, Marfa Ignatyevna was in the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: yard and heard him in time. She did not see the fall, but heard his, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: scream—the strange, peculiar scream, long familiar to her—the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: scream of the epileptic falling in a fit. They could not tell whether, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: the fit had come on him at the moment he was descending the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: steps, so that he must have fallen unconscious, or whether it was, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: 354, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: The Brothers Karamazov, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: who was known to be liable to them. They found him at the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: bottom of the cellar steps, writhing in convulsions and foaming, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: at the mouth. It was thought at first that he must have broken, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: something—an arm or a leg—and hurt himself, but “God had, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: preserved him,” as Marfa Ignatyevna expressed it—nothing of, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: the kind had happened. But it was difficult to get him out of, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: the cellar. They asked the neighbors to help and managed it, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: somehow. Fyodor Pavlovitch himself was present at the whole, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: ceremony. He helped, evidently alarmed and upset. The sick, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: man did not regain consciousness; the convulsions ceased for a, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: time, but then began again, and every one concluded that the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: same thing would happen, as had happened a year before, when, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: he accidentally fell from the garret. They remembered that ice, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: had been put on his head then. There was still ice in the cellar,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and Marfa Ignatyevna had some brought up. In the evening,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Fyodor Pavlovitch sent for Doctor Herzenstube, who arrived at, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: once. He was a most estimable old man, and the most careful and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: conscientious doctor in the province. After careful examination,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: he concluded that the fit was a very violent one and might have, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: serious consequences; that meanwhile he, Herzenstube, did not, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: fully understand it, but that by to-morrow morning, if the present, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: [310], Font: Times-Roman, Size: 7.970099925994873
Text: remedies were unavailing, he would venture to try something, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: else. The invalid was taken to the lodge, to a room next to, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Grigory's and Marfa Ignatyevna's., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Then Fyodor Pavlovitch had one misfortune after another to, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: put up with that day. Marfa Ignatyevna cooked the dinner, and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: the soup, compared with Smerdyakov's, was “no better than dish-, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: water,” and the fowl was so dried up that it was impossible to, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: masticate it. To her master's bitter, though deserved, reproaches,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Marfa Ignatyevna replied that the fowl was a very old one to, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: begin with, and that she had never been trained as a cook. In the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: evening there was another trouble in store for Fyodor Pavlovitch;, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: he was informed that Grigory, who had not been well for the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: 355, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Pavlovitch finished his tea as early as possible and locked himself, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: up alone in the house. He was in terrible excitement and sus-, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: pense. That evening he reckoned on Grushenka's coming almost, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: as a certainty. He had received from Smerdyakov that morning, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: an assurance “that she had promised to come without fail.” The, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: incorrigible old man's heart throbbed with excitement; he paced, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: up and down his empty rooms listening. He had to be on the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: alert. Dmitri might be on the watch for her somewhere, and when, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: she knocked on the window (Smerdyakov had informed him two, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: days before that he had told her where and how to knock) the door, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: must be opened at once. She must not be a second in the passage,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: for fear—which God forbid!—that she should be frightened and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: run away. Fyodor Pavlovitch had much to think of, but never, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: Father Païssy, Father Mihaïl, the warden of the hermitage, a man, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: took place then, or whether he added to it his notes of parts of, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: interrupt Father Zossima much, yet they too talked, perhaps even, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: told something themselves. Besides, Father Zossima could not, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: have carried on an uninterrupted narrative, for he was sometimes, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: gasping for breath, his voice failed him, and he even lay down, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: to rest on his bed, though he did not fall asleep and his visitors, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: did not leave their seats. Once or twice the conversation was, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: interrupted by Father Païssy's reading the Gospel. It is worthy of, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: note, too, that no one of them supposed that he would die that, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: night, for on that evening of his life after his deep sleep in the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: day he seemed suddenly to have found new strength, which kept, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: him up through this long conversation. It was like a last effort, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: of love which gave him marvelous energy; only for a little time,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: not able to go to church long, he took to his bed, so he had to, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: and beautiful, everything praying to God. Only we two were not, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: sleeping, the lad and I, and we talked of the beauty of this world, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: that the young lady looked on me with favor and my heart was, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: aflame at such an idea. Later on I saw and fully realized that I, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: perhaps was not so passionately in love with her at all, but only, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: I did drop some hint as to my feelings however, though I put off, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: were ordered off for two months to another district., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: On my return two months later, I found the young lady already, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: married to a rich neighboring landowner, a very amiable man,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: circumstance that my mind was positively clouded. The worst, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: of it all was that, as I learned then, the young landowner had, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: been a long while betrothed to her, and I had met him indeed, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: many times in her house, but blinded by my conceit I had noticed, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: nothing. And this particularly mortified me; almost everybody, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: had known all about it, while I knew nothing. I was filled with, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: sudden irrepressible fury. With flushed face I began recalling, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: how often I had been on the point of declaring my love to her,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: I concluded, have been laughing at me all the time. Later on, of, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: course, I reflected and remembered that she had been very far, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: “I can, with the greatest pleasure, and I shall look upon it as, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: “No, it's not excessive,” he answered; “believe me, such a, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: into the face and I felt all at once a complete trust in him and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: me, and how I had bowed down to the ground at his feet. “From, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: at home, and when once I had started on that road, to go farther, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: said a word, yet continually asked me about myself. In spite of, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: that I became very fond of him and spoke with perfect frankness, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: “That life is heaven,” he said to me suddenly, “that I have, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: long been thinking about”; and all at once he added, “I think of, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: through the negligence of the servants, left unlocked. He hoped, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: to find it so, and so it was. He made his way in the dark to her, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: her maids had gone off to a birthday-party in the same street,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: without asking leave. The other servants slept in the servants', Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: up at the sight of her asleep, and then vindictive, jealous anger, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: took possession of his heart, and like a drunken man, beside, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: himself, he thrust a knife into her heart, so that she did not even, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: cry out. Then with devilish and criminal cunning he contrived, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: fact that for a long time he really was at peace—he told me this, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: Is it so inconceivable that that grand and simple-hearted unity, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: I had heard from him in childhood: “Am I worth it, that another, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: should serve me and be ordered about by me in his poverty and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: [353], Font: Times-Roman, Size: 7.970099925994873
Text: self-evident ideas should be so slow to occur to our minds., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: It is impossible that there should be no servants in the world,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: but act so that your servant may be freer in spirit than if he were, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: even let him see it, and that without any pride on my part or any, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: kindred, so that I may take him into my family and rejoice in, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: doing so? Even now this can be done, but it will lead to the grand, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: unity of men in the future, when a man will not seek servants for, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: himself, or desire to turn his fellow creatures into servants as he, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: does now, but on the contrary, will long with his whole heart to, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: be the servant of all, as the Gospel teaches., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: And can it be a dream, that in the end man will find his joy, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: Christ's help we shall accomplish this great thing. And how, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: many ideas there have been on earth in the history of man which, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: destined hour had come, they came forth and spread over the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: almost repulsive to recall that event which caused such frivolous, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: agitation and was such a stumbling-block to many, though in, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: Some of those present may perhaps have inwardly noticed it,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: only to reflect that the anticipation of decay and corruption from, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: the body of such a saint was an actual absurdity, calling for, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: compassion (if not a smile) for the lack of faith and the frivolity, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: it implied. For they expected something quite different., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: And, behold, soon after midday there were signs of some-, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: thing, at first only observed in silence by those who came in and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: out and were evidently each afraid to communicate the thought, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: in his mind. But by three o'clock those signs had become so, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: clear and unmistakable, that the news swiftly reached all the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: One such, whose memory was particularly cherished, was an, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: old monk, Job, who had died seventy years before at the age of, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: a hundred and five. He had been a celebrated ascetic, rigid in, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: memory cherished in the monastery was that of the famous Father, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Varsonofy, who was only recently dead and had preceded Father, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Zossima in the eldership. He was reverenced during his lifetime, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: as a crazy saint by all the pilgrims to the monastery. There was, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: a tradition that both of these had lain in their coffins as though, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: alive, that they had shown no signs of decomposition when they, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: The Brothers Karamazov, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: that several different causes were simultaneously at work, one of, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: which was the deeply-rooted hostility to the institution of elders, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: as a pernicious innovation, an antipathy hidden deep in the hearts, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: of many of the monks. Even more powerful was jealousy of the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: dead man's saintliness, so firmly established during his lifetime, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: that it was almost a forbidden thing to question it. For though, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: the late elder had won over many hearts, more by love than by, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: miracles, and had gathered round him a mass of loving adherents,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: none the less, in fact, rather the more on that account he had, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: and open, not only in the monastery but in the world outside, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: it. He did no one any harm, but “Why do they think him so, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: saintly?” And that question alone, gradually repeated, gave rise, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: at last to an intense, insatiable hatred of him. That, I believe,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: was why many people were extremely delighted at the smell of, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: decomposition which came so quickly, for not a day had passed, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: of worldly visitors was greatly increased and this was no doubt, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: But external decorum was still preserved and Father Païssy, with, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: a stern face, continued firmly and distinctly reading aloud the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Gospel, apparently not noticing what was taking place around, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: him, though he had, in fact, observed something unusual long, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: before. But at last the murmurs, first subdued but gradually, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: louder and more confident, reached even him. “It shows God's, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: judgment is not as man's,” Father Païssy heard suddenly. The, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: first to give utterance to this sentiment was a layman, an elderly, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: official from the town, known to be a man of great piety. But he, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: only repeated aloud what the monks had long been whispering., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: They had long before formulated this damning conclusion, and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: the worst of it was that a sort of triumphant satisfaction at that, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: conclusion became more and more apparent every moment. Soon, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: they began to lay aside even external decorum and almost seemed, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: to feel they had a sort of right to discard it., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: “And for what reason can, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: corruption “was in excess of nature,” and so the finger of God, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: conclusion., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: But the meek Father's words had little effect and even pro-, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: voked a mocking retort. “That's all pedantry and innovation, no, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: forward his own opinion with little confidence as though scarcely, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: believing in it himself. He foresaw with distress that something, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: very unseemly was beginning and that there were positive signs, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: of disobedience. Little by little, all the sensible monks were, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: all who loved the elder and had accepted with devout obedience, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: blame of Father Zossima. “His teaching was false; he taught that, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: some of the oldest monks, strictest in their devotion, genuine, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: ascetics, who had kept silent during the life of the deceased elder,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: but now suddenly unsealed their lips. And this was terrible, for, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: their words had great influence on young monks who were not, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: yet firm in their convictions. The monk from Obdorsk heard all, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: this attentively, heaving deep sighs and nodding his head. “Yes,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: clearly Father Ferapont was right in his judgment yesterday,” and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: at that moment Father Ferapont himself made his appearance, as, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: overlooked this neglect on the ground of his craziness, and did, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: not keep him to the rules binding on all the rest. But if the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: whole truth is to be told, they hardly had a choice about it. For, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: it would have been discreditable to insist on burdening with the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: common regulations so great an ascetic, who prayed day and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: night (he even dropped asleep on his knees). If they had insisted,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: the monks would have said, “He is holier than all of us and he, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: it's because he knows when he ought to; he has his own rule.”, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: It was to avoid the chance of these sinful murmurs that Father, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: Father Zossima., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: And now the news had reached him in his, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: hut that “God's judgment is not the same as man's,” and that, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: something had happened which was “in excess of nature.” It may, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: well be supposed that among the first to run to him with the news, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: was the monk from Obdorsk, who had visited him the evening, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: before and left his cell terror-stricken., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: I have mentioned above, that though Father Païssy, standing, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: firm and immovable reading the Gospel over the coffin, could, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: not hear nor see what was passing outside the cell, he gauged, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: most of it correctly in his heart, for he knew the men surrounding, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: him, well. He was not shaken by it, but awaited what would, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: come next without fear, watching with penetration and insight, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: for the outcome of the general excitement., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Suddenly an extraordinary uproar in the passage in open de-, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: [371], Font: Times-Roman, Size: 7.970099925994873
Text: and Father Ferapont appeared in the doorway. Behind him there, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: could be seen accompanying him a crowd of monks, together, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: with many people from the town. They did not, however, enter, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: the cell, but stood at the bottom of the steps, waiting to see what, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Father Ferapont would say or do. For they felt with a certain, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: awe, in spite of their audacity, that he had not come for nothing., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Standing in the doorway, Father Ferapont raised his arms, and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: under his right arm the keen inquisitive little eyes of the monk, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: from Obdorsk peeped in. He alone, in his intense curiosity, could, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: not resist running up the steps after Father Ferapont. The others,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: on the contrary, pressed farther back in sudden alarm when the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: and four corners of the cell in succession. All who accompanied, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: remembered that he had felt at once a pang at heart on seeing, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: At that moment Alyosha passed him, hurrying away, but not, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: in the direction of the church. Their eyes met. Alyosha quickly, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: Païssy's sorrowful question, “Are you too with those of little, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: he is not with those of little faith. Quite the contrary.” Indeed,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: all his trouble came from the fact that he was of great faith., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: But still the trouble was there and was so agonizing that even, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: long afterwards Alyosha thought of that sorrowful day as one of, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: the bitterest and most fatal days of his life. If the question is, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: to the fact that his elder's body had shown signs of premature, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: while she talked. Grushenka snatched the letter from her and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: carried it to the candle. It was only a note, a few lines. She read, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: reached the bottom of the steps, Grushenka's bedroom window, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: Alyosha made no reply, he seemed not to have heard. He, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: walked fast beside Rakitin as though in a terrible hurry. He was, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: lost in thought and moved mechanically. Rakitin felt a sudden, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: “So you despise me now for those twenty-five roubles? I've, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: And he turned abruptly into another street, leaving Alyosha, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: after a day of such agitation for all. Alyosha timidly opened, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: the door and went into the elder's cell where his coffin was now, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: standing. There was no one in the cell but Father Païssy, reading, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: the Gospel in solitude over the coffin, and the young novice, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Porfiry, who, exhausted by the previous night's conversation, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and the disturbing incidents of the day, was sleeping the deep, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: sound sleep of youth on the floor of the other room. Though, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Father Païssy heard Alyosha come in, he did not even look in, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: his direction. Alyosha turned to the right from the door to the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: corner, fell on his knees and began to pray., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: His soul was overflowing but with mingled feelings; no single, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: sensation stood out distinctly; on the contrary, one drove out, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: another in a slow, continual rotation. But there was a sweetness, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: in his heart and, strange to say, Alyosha was not surprised at, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: it. Again he saw that coffin before him, the hidden dead figure, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: so precious to him, but the weeping and poignant grief of the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: morning was no longer aching in his soul. As soon as he came, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: in, he fell down before the coffin as before a holy shrine, but joy,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: joy was glowing in his mind and in his heart. The one window, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: of the cell was open, the air was fresh and cool. “So the smell, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: must have become stronger, if they opened the window,” thought, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Alyosha. But even this thought of the smell of corruption, which, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: had seemed to him so awful and humiliating a few hours before,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: no longer made him feel miserable or indignant. He began quietly, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: things—something steadfast and comforting—and he was aware, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: whose arrival she was expecting with such emotion and dread., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: It is true that of late Grushenka had been very silent about it., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Yet he was perfectly aware of a letter she had received a month, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: ago from her seducer, and had heard of it from her own lips. He, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: partly knew, too, what the letter contained. In a moment of spite, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Grushenka had shown him that letter, but to her astonishment, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: he attached hardly any consequence to it. It would be hard to, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: say why this was. Perhaps, weighed down by all the hideous, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: horror of his struggle with his own father for this woman, he, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: was incapable of imagining any danger more terrible, at any, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: suddenly turned up again after five years' disappearance, still, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: which had been shown to Mitya, the possibility of his new rival's, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: in which his return was alluded to more definitely. He had,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: always believing that it would come suddenly, on the impulse of, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: the moment. All of a sudden she would say to him: “Take me,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: I'm yours for ever,” and it would all be over. He would seize her, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and bear her away at once to the ends of the earth. Oh, then he, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: would bear her away at once, as far, far away as possible; to the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: farthest end of Russia, if not of the earth, then he would marry, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: her, and settle down with her incognito, so that no one would, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: know anything about them, there, here, or anywhere. Then, oh,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: then, a new life would begin at once!, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Of this different, reformed and “virtuous” life (“it must, it, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: thirsted for that reformation and renewal. The filthy morass, in, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: which he had sunk of his own free will, was too revolting to him,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and, like very many men in such cases, he put faith above all in, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: change of place. If only it were not for these people, if only it, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: were not for these circumstances, if only he could fly away from, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: this accursed place—he would be altogether regenerated, would, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: enter on a new path. That was what he believed in, and what he, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: But Mitya did not know what would happen then. Up to the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: last hour he didn't know. That must be said to his credit. He, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: watching and spying in agony, while he prepared himself for the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: If she were to say to him: “I'm yours; take me away,” how, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: [408], Font: Times-Roman, Size: 7.970099925994873

Text: Fyodor Pavlovitch, doles which had gone on without interruption, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: for so many years, ceased. Grushenka had money, of course, but, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: with regard to this Mitya suddenly evinced extraordinary pride;, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: he wanted to carry her away and begin the new life with her, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: himself, at his own expense, not at hers. He could not conceive, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: of taking her money, and the very idea caused him a pang of, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: intense repulsion. I won't enlarge on this fact or analyze it here,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: but confine myself to remarking that this was his attitude at the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: moment. All this may have arisen indirectly and unconsciously, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: from the secret stings of his conscience for the money of Kate-, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: rina Ivanovna that he had dishonestly appropriated. “I've been a, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: scoundrel to one of them, and I shall be a scoundrel again to the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: other directly,” was his feeling then, as he explained after: “and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: when Grushenka knows, she won't care for such a scoundrel.”, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Where then was he to get the means, where was he to get the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: fateful money? Without it, all would be lost and nothing could, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: be done, “and only because I hadn't the money. Oh, the shame of, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: it!”, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: To anticipate things: he did, perhaps, know where to get the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: money, knew, perhaps, where it lay at that moment. I will say, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: no more of this here, as it will all be clear later. But his chief, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text:  to take it, he must, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: common pickpocket, I'm a scoundrel, and I don't want to begin, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: a new life as a scoundrel,” Mitya decided. And so he made up, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: his mind to move heaven and earth to return Katerina Ivanovna, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text:  first of all, Font: Times-Italic, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: . The final stage of this, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: decision, so to say, had been reached only during the last hours,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: that is, after his last interview with Alyosha, two days before,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: on the high-road, on the evening when Grushenka had insulted, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Katerina Ivanovna, and Mitya, after hearing Alyosha's account, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: of it, had admitted that he was a scoundrel, and told him to tell, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Katerina Ivanovna so, if it could be any comfort to her. After, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: parting from his brother on that night, he had felt in his frenzy, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: that it would be better “to murder and rob some one than fail to, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: pay my debt to Katya. I'd rather every one thought me a robber, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: used her money to run away with Grushenka and begin a new, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: he might well fancy at times that his brain would give way. But, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: Strange to say, though one would have supposed there was, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: nothing left for him but despair—for what chance had he, with, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: nothing in the world, to raise such a sum?—yet to the very end, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: he persisted in hoping that he would get that three thousand, that, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: the money would somehow come to him of itself, as though it, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: He suddenly determined to go to Samsonov, the merchant who, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: was Grushenka's protector, and to propose a “scheme” to him,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and by means of it to obtain from him at once the whole of the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: sum required. Of the commercial value of his scheme he had no, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: the merchant by sight, he was not acquainted with him and had, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: never spoken a word to him. But for some unknown reason he, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: had long entertained the conviction that the old reprobate, who, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: Grushenka's securing a respectable position, and marrying a man, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: not object, but that this was what he desired, and, if opportunity, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: arose, that he would be ready to help. From some rumor, or, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: perhaps from some stray word of Grushenka's, he had gathered, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: at all, for it was known to every one in the town that he was only, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: It was a very large and gloomy old house of two stories, with a, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: once refused to see him. But Mitya persisted and sent his name up, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: again. Samsonov questioned the lad minutely: What he looked, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: like? Whether he was drunk? Was he going to make a row?, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: The answer he received was: that he was sober, but wouldn't go, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: away. The old man again refused to see him. Then Mitya, who, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: had foreseen this, and purposely brought pencil and paper with, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: him, wrote clearly on the piece of paper the words: “On most, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: and sent it up to the old man., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: After thinking a little Samsonov told the lad to take the visitor, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: to the drawing-room, and sent the old woman downstairs with, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: a summons to his younger son to come upstairs to him at once., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: The old man had sent for this giant, not because he, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: was afraid of the “captain” (he was by no means of a timorous, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: Supported by his son and the servant-lad, he waddled at last into, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: the drawing-room. It may be assumed that he felt considerable, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: curiosity. The drawing-room in which Mitya was awaiting him, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: was a vast, dreary room that laid a weight of depression on the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: heart. It had a double row of windows, a gallery, marbled walls,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: Mitya was sitting on a little chair at the entrance, awaiting his, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: fate with nervous impatience. When the old man appeared at the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: The Brothers Karamazov, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: with his long, military stride walked to meet him. Mitya was well, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: dressed, in a frock-coat, buttoned up, with a round hat and black, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: gloves in his hands, just as he had been three days before at the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: elder's, at the family meeting with his father and brothers. The, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: old man waited for him, standing dignified and unbending, and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Mitya felt at once that he had looked him through and through as, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: he advanced. Mitya was greatly impressed, too, with Samsonov's, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: immensely swollen face. His lower lip, which had always been, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: thick, hung down now, looking like a bun. He bowed to his guest, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: in dignified silence, motioned him to a low chair by the sofa, and,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: leaning on his son's arm he began lowering himself on to the sofa, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: opposite, groaning painfully, so that Mitya, seeing his painful, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: exertions, immediately felt remorseful and sensitively conscious, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: of his insignificance in the presence of the dignified person he, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: had ventured to disturb., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: “What is it you want of me, sir?” said the old man, deliber-, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: ately, distinctly, severely, but courteously, when he was at last, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: seated., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Mitya started, leapt up, but sat down again. Then he began at, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: once speaking with loud, nervous haste, gesticulating, and in a, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: positive frenzy. He was unmistakably a man driven into a corner,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: on the brink of ruin, catching at the last straw, ready to sink if, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: he failed. Old Samsonov probably grasped all this in an instant,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: though his face remained cold and immovable as a statue's., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: “Most honored sir, Kuzma Kuzmitch, you have no doubt heard, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: Karamazov, who robbed me of my inheritance from my mother, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: ... seeing the whole town is gossiping about it ... for here every, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: lady for whom I have the highest respect and esteem ...”, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: So Mitya began, and broke down at the first sentence. We will, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: not reproduce his speech word for word, but will only summarize, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: Chapter I. Kuzma Samsonov, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: 473, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: the gist of it. Three months ago, he said, he had of express, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: intention (Mitya purposely used these words instead of “inten-, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: “a distinguished lawyer, Kuzma Kuzmitch, Pavel Pavlovitch, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: intellect, the mind of a statesman ... he knows you, too ... spoke, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: of you in the highest terms ...” Mitya broke down again. But, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: these breaks did not deter him. He leapt instantly over the gaps,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and struggled on and on., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: This Korneplodov, after questioning him minutely, and in-, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: specting the documents he was able to bring him (Mitya alluded, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: somewhat vaguely to these documents, and slurred over the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: subject with special haste), reported that they certainly might, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: take proceedings concerning the village of Tchermashnya, which, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: ought, he said, to have come to him, Mitya, from his mother,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and so checkmate the old villain, his father ... “because every, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: door was not closed and justice might still find a loophole.” In, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: fact, he might reckon on an additional sum of six or even seven, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: thousand roubles from Fyodor Pavlovitch, as Tchermashnya was, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: worth, at least, twenty-five thousand, he might say twenty-eight, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: thousand, in fact, “thirty, thirty, Kuzma Kuzmitch, and would, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: you believe it, I didn't get seventeen from that heartless man!”, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: So he, Mitya, had thrown the business up, for the time, knowing, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: nothing about the law, but on coming here was struck dumb by, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: a cross-claim made upon him (here Mitya went adrift again and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: again took a flying leap forward), “so will not you, excellent and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: honored Kuzma Kuzmitch, be willing to take up all my claims, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: against that unnatural monster, and pay me a sum down of only, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: three thousand?... You see, you cannot, in any case, lose over it., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: On my honor, my honor, I swear that. Quite the contrary, you, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: may make six or seven thousand instead of three.” Above all, he, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: awkwardly, perhaps, but I'm not a literary man. You see, I'm on, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: the one side, and that monster on the other. So you must choose., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: “How strange it is! On the way here it seemed all right, and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: now it's nothing but nonsense.” The idea suddenly dawned on his, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: despairing mind. All the while he had been talking, the old man, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: “Everything was on the verge of ruin and my guardian angel, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: man as Samsonov (a most worthy old man, and what dignity!), Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: Secondly, he did not find the priest at home at Ilyinskoe; he had, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: to Mitya that, though the man's name really was Lyagavy, he, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: in conclusion., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Mitya was somewhat surprised for a moment, and explained, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: that that was what Samsonov had called him. On hearing this fact,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: This annoyed him, but he controlled himself., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: They went into the hut. The forester lived in one half of the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: hut, and Gorstkin was lodging in the other, the better room the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: by the arms, by the legs, shaking his head, lifting him up and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: very reasonably, that, even if he succeeded in wakening the man,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: a cricket chirped; it became insufferably close in the overheated, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: garden, the door of his father's house mysteriously opening and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Grushenka running in. He leapt up from the bench., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: “It's a tragedy!” he said, grinding his teeth. Mechanically he, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: a black waistcoat, from the pocket of which peeped the chain, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: At last he realized that the room was full of charcoal fumes, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: about to go out. Mitya cried out, and ran staggering across the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: at once that he should walk with her to Samsonov's, where she, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: said she absolutely must go “to settle his accounts,” and when, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: He was that sort of jealous man who, in the absence of the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: may be happening to her, and how she may be betraying him,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: but, when shaken, heartbroken, convinced of her faithlessness, he, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: runs back to her; at the first glance at her face, her gay, laughing,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: affectionate face, he revives at once, lays aside all suspicion and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: with joyful shame abuses himself for his jealousy., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: After leaving Grushenka at the gate he rushed home. Oh, he, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: had so much still to do that day! But a load had been lifted from, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: rival did disappear next day, he would invent another one and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: would be jealous of him. And one might wonder what there was, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: in a love that had to be so watched over, what a love could be, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: his love for the woman, there was an element of something far, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: where he could get a loan. He had a brace of fine dueling pistols, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: He did in fact jump up, and instantly contrived to catch hold of, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: the top of the fence. Then he vigorously pulled himself up and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: “Yes, the old man's bedroom is lighted up. She's there!” and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: reason rose to his mind. “If only no one heard me jump over, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: the fence! I think not.” Standing still for a minute, he walked, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: softly over the grass in the garden, avoiding the trees and shrubs., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: He walked slowly, creeping stealthily at every step, listening to, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: his own footsteps. It took him five minutes to reach the lighted, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: window, and raised himself on tiptoe. All Fyodor Pavlovitch's, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: bedroom lay open before him. It was not a large room, and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: was divided in two parts by a red screen, “Chinese,” as Fyodor, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: Mitya's mind, “and behind the screen, is Grushenka,” thought, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: his new striped-silk dressing-gown, which Mitya had never seen,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: shirt of fine linen with gold studs peeped out under the collar of, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: the dressing-gown. On his head Fyodor Pavlovitch had the same, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: red bandage which Alyosha had seen., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: His father was standing near the window, apparently lost in, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: thought. Suddenly he jerked up his head, listened a moment,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and hearing nothing went up to the table, poured out half a glass, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: of brandy from a decanter and drank it off. Then he uttered a, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: deep sigh, again stood still a moment, walked carelessly up to, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: the looking-glass on the wall, with his right hand raised the red, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: bandage on his forehead a little, and began examining his bruises, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and scars, which had not yet disappeared., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: “He's alone,” thought Mitya, “in all probability he's alone.”, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Fyodor Pavlovitch moved away from the looking-glass, turned, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: suddenly to the window and looked out. Mitya instantly slipped, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: away into the shadow., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: “She may be there behind the screen. Perhaps she's asleep by, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: now,” he thought, with a pang at his heart. Fyodor Pavlovitch, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: moved away from the window. “He's looking for her out of the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: window, so she's not there. Why should he stare out into the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: dark? He's wild with impatience.” ... Mitya slipped back at once,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and fell to gazing in at the window again. The old man was, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: Mitya watched him eagerly., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: “He's alone, he's alone!” he repeated again. “If she were here,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: his face would be different.”, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Strange to say, a queer, irrational vexation rose up in his heart, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: that she was not here. “It's not that she's not here,” he explained, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: to himself, immediately, “but that I can't tell for certain whether, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: that moment exceptionally clear, that he took in everything to the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: slightest detail, and missed no point. But a feeling of misery, the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: misery of uncertainty and indecision, was growing in his heart, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: with every instant. “Is she here or not?” The angry doubt filled, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: his heart, and suddenly, making up his mind, he put out his hand, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and softly knocked on the window frame. He knocked the signal, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: the old man had agreed upon with Smerdyakov, twice slowly and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: The old man started, jerked up his head, and, jumping up, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: quickly, ran to the window. Mitya slipped away into the shadow., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: “Grushenka, is it you? Is it you?” he said, in a sort of trembling, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: half-whisper. “Where are you, my angel, where are you?” He, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: “Where are you?” cried the old man again; and he thrust his, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: head out farther, thrust it out to the shoulders, gazing in all, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: groaning, he went out on the steps. No doubt he only intended to, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: look out from the steps, for he was hardly able to walk, the pain, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: in his back and his right leg was intolerable. But he suddenly, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: remembered that he had not locked the little gate into the garden, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: that evening. He was the most punctual and precise of men, a, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: man who adhered to an unchangeable routine, and habits that, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: lasted for years. Limping and writhing with pain he went down, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: the steps and towards the garden. Yes, the gate stood wide open., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Mechanically he stepped into the garden. Perhaps he fancied, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: something, perhaps caught some sound, and, glancing to the left, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: he saw his master's window open. No one was looking out of it, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: then., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: “What's it open for? It's not summer now,” thought Grigory,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and suddenly, at that very instant he caught a glimpse of some-, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: thing extraordinary before him in the garden. Forty paces in front, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: of him a man seemed to be running in the dark, a sort of shadow, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: was moving very fast., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: “Good Lord!” cried Grigory beside himself, and forgetting the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: pain in his back, he hurried to intercept the running figure. He, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: took a short cut, evidently he knew the garden better; the flying, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: figure went towards the bath-house, ran behind it and rushed, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: to the garden fence. Grigory followed, not losing sight of him,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and ran, forgetting everything. He reached the fence at the very, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: moment the man was climbing over it. Grigory cried out, beside, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: not in the grass but on the path, in a most conspicuous place. For, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: some seconds he examined the prostrate figure before him. The, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: old man's head was covered with blood. Mitya put out his hand, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and began feeling it. He remembered afterwards clearly, that he, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: had been awfully anxious to make sure whether he had broken, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: the old man's skull, or simply stunned him with the pestle. But, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: the blood was flowing horribly; and in a moment Mitya's fingers, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: were drenched with the hot stream. He remembered taking out, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: of his pocket the clean white handkerchief with which he had, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: provided himself for his visit to Madame Hohlakov, and putting, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: it to the old man's head, senselessly trying to wipe the blood from, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: his face and temples. But the handkerchief was instantly soaked, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: with blood., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: “Good heavens!, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: what am I doing it for?” thought Mitya,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: suddenly pulling himself together. “If I have broken his skull,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: how can I find out now? And what difference does it make, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: You've come to grief, old man, so there you must lie!” he said, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: the lane and fell to running—the handkerchief soaked with blood, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: he held, crushed up in his right fist, and as he ran he thrust it, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: into the back pocket of his coat. He ran headlong, and the few, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: passers-by who met him in the dark, in the streets, remembered, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: Just ten minutes later Dmitri went in to Pyotr Ilyitch Perhotin,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: the young official with whom he had pawned his pistols. It was, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: by now half-past eight, and Pyotr Ilyitch had finished his evening, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: tea, and had just put his coat on again to go to the “Metropolis”, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: to play billiards. Mitya caught him coming out., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Seeing him with his face all smeared with blood, the young, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: man uttered a cry of surprise., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: “Good heavens! What is the matter?”, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: “I've come for my pistols,” said Mitya, “and brought you the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: money. And thanks very much. I'm in a hurry, Pyotr Ilyitch,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: please make haste.”, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Pyotr Ilyitch grew more and more surprised; he suddenly, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: caught sight of a bundle of bank-notes in Mitya's hand, and what, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: was more, he had walked in holding the notes as no one walks in, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and no one carries money: he had them in his right hand, and held, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: them outstretched as if to show them. Perhotin's servant-boy,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: [445], Font: Times-Roman, Size: 7.970099925994873
Text: who met Mitya in the passage, said afterwards that he walked, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: into the passage in the same way, with the money outstretched, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: in his hand, so he must have been carrying them like that even in, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: the streets. They were all rainbow-colored hundred-rouble notes,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and the fingers holding them were covered with blood., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: When Pyotr Ilyitch was questioned later on as to the sum of, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: money, he said that it was difficult to judge at a glance, but that it, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: might have been two thousand, or perhaps three, but it was a big,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: “fat” bundle. “Dmitri Fyodorovitch,” so he testified afterwards,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: “seemed unlike himself, too; not drunk, but, as it were, exalted,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: lost to everything, but at the same time, as it were, absorbed,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: as though pondering and searching for something and unable to, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: come to a decision. He was in great haste, answered abruptly and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: very strangely, and at moments seemed not at all dejected but, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: quite cheerful.”, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: “But what, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text:  is, Font: Times-Italic, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text:  the matter with you? What's wrong?” cried Pyotr, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Ilyitch, looking wildly at his guest. “How is it that you're all, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: The Brothers Karamazov, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: covered with blood? Have you had a fall? Look at yourself!”, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: He took him by the elbow and led him to the glass., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Seeing his blood-stained face, Mitya started and scowled, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: wrathfully., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: “Damnation! That's the last straw,” he muttered angrily, hur-, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: riedly changing the notes from his right hand to the left, and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: impulsively jerked the handkerchief out of his pocket. But the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: handkerchief turned out to be soaked with blood, too (it was the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: handkerchief he had used to wipe Grigory's face). There was, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: scarcely a white spot on it, and it had not merely begun to dry,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: but had stiffened into a crumpled ball and could not be pulled, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: apart. Mitya threw it angrily on the floor., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: “Oh, damn it!” he said. “Haven't you a rag of some sort ... to, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: wipe my face?”, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: “So you're only stained, not wounded? You'd better wash,”, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: said Pyotr Ilyitch. “Here's a wash-stand. I'll pour you out some, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: water.”, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: “A wash-stand? That's all right ... but where am I to put this?”, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: With the strangest perplexity he indicated his bundle of hun-, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: dred-rouble notes, looking inquiringly at Pyotr Ilyitch as though, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: “In your pocket, or on the table here. They won't be lost.”, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: “In my pocket? Yes, in my pocket. All right.... But, I say,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: that's all nonsense,” he cried, as though suddenly coming out of, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: his absorption. “Look here, let's first settle that business of the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: pistols. Give them back to me. Here's your money ... because I, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: am in great need of them ... and I haven't a minute, a minute to, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: spare.”, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: And taking the topmost note from the bundle he held it out to, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Pyotr Ilyitch., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: 511, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: “No,” said Mitya, looking again at the bundle, and as though, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: not trusting his own words he turned over two or three of the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: topmost ones., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: “No, they're all alike,” he added, and again he looked inquir-, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: ingly at Pyotr Ilyitch., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: “How have you grown so rich?” the latter asked. “Wait, I'll, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: send my boy to Plotnikov's, they close late—to see if they won't, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: change it. Here, Misha!” he called into the passage., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: “To Plotnikov's shop—first-rate!” cried Mitya, as though, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: struck by an idea. “Misha,” he turned to the boy as he came, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: in, “look here, run to Plotnikov's and tell them that Dmitri Fyo-, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: ing Pyotr Ilyitch); “they know all about it, don't you trouble,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: remember, Misha, if you are called Misha—His name is Misha,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: “But listen!” Pyotr Ilyitch interrupted with some impatience., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: “I say, let him simply run and change the money and tell them, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: Pyotr Ilyitch seemed to hurry Misha off on purpose, because, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: the boy remained standing with his mouth and eyes wide open,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: apparently understanding little of Mitya's orders, gazing up with, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: amazement and terror at his blood-stained face and the trembling, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: bloodstained fingers that held the notes., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: “Well, now come and wash,” said Pyotr Ilyitch sternly. “Put, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: again:, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: “Look, your coat's covered with blood, too!”, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: “That ... it's not the coat. It's only a little here on the sleeve...., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: And that's only here where the handkerchief lay. It must have, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: soaked through. I must have sat on the handkerchief at Fenya's,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and the blood's come through,” Mitya explained at once with, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: a childlike unconsciousness that was astounding. Pyotr Ilyitch, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: listened, frowning., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: They began to wash. Pyotr Ilyitch held the jug and poured, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: out the water. Mitya, in desperate haste, scarcely soaped his, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: hands (they were trembling, and Pyotr Ilyitch remembered it, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: afterwards). But the young official insisted on his soaping them, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: thoroughly and rubbing them more. He seemed to exercise more, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and more sway over Mitya, as time went on. It may be noted in, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: invited to drink to their good understanding, he drank off his, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: glass without waiting for any one else. His whole countenance, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: suddenly changed. The solemn and tragic expression with which, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: he had entered vanished completely, and a look of something, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: childlike came into his face. He seemed to have become suddenly, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: gentle and subdued. He looked shyly and happily at every one,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: with a continual nervous little laugh, and the blissful expression, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: of a dog who has done wrong, been punished, and forgiven., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: He seemed to have forgotten everything, and was looking round, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: at every one with a childlike smile of delight. He looked at, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Grushenka, laughing continually, and bringing his chair close up, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: to her. By degrees he had gained some idea of the two Poles,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: though he had formed no definite conception of them yet., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: The Pole on the sofa struck him by his dignified demeanor, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and his Polish accent; and, above all, by his pipe. “Well, what of, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: it? It's a good thing he's smoking a pipe,” he reflected. The Pole's, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: puffy, middle-aged face, with its tiny nose and two very thin,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: pointed, dyed and impudent-looking mustaches, had not so far, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: roused the faintest doubts in Mitya. He was not even particularly, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: struck by the Pole's absurd wig made in Siberia, with love-locks, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: foolishly combed forward over the temples. “I suppose it's all, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: contempt, still only impressed Mitya by his great height, which, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: was in striking contrast to the Pole on the sofa. “If he stood up, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: [471], Font: Times-Roman, Size: 7.970099925994873

Text: It occurred to him, too, that this Pole must be the friend of the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: other, as it were, a “bodyguard,” and no doubt the big Pole was, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: at the disposal of the little Pole with the pipe. But this all seemed, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: to Mitya perfectly right and not to be questioned. In his mood of, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: chance, and he met the Poles here at the inn for the first time in, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: his life. Grushenka he knew before, and had once been with some, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: making much of him, but he seemed somehow to be unmoved, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: quite like a child, and was not at all ashamed of it, even when, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: he was aware of it himself. As a rule he was very willful, even, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: capricious, though always friendly. Sometimes there was some-, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: and listen, seeming all the while to be persistently dreaming over, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: “Only imagine, I've been taking him about with me for the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: His scattered thoughts came together; his sensations, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: blended into a whole and threw a sudden light into his mind. A, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: a minute he stood, undecided. A few hours earlier, when he had, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: terror at least was at an end: that first, rightful lover, that fateful, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: figure had vanished, leaving no trace. The terrible phantom had, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: tenant-colonel, was a widower and an excellent man. He had, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: only come to us three years previously, but had won general, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: esteem, chiefly because he “knew how to keep society together.”, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: He was never without visitors, and could not have got on without, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: them. Some one or other was always dining with him; he never, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: sat down to table without guests. He gave regular dinners, too, on, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: all sorts of occasions, sometimes most surprising ones. Though, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: as that he made conspicuous blunders in his interpretation of, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: them. This was not from any special lack of intelligence, but, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: from carelessness, for he was always in too great a hurry to go, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: by a fearful epileptic scream from Smerdyakov, who was lying, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: in the next room unconscious. That scream always preceded his, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: fits, and always terrified and upset Marfa Ignatyevna. She could, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: never get accustomed to it. She jumped up and ran half-awake, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: to Smerdyakov's room. But it was dark there, and she could, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: only hear the invalid beginning to gasp and struggle., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: husband, but suddenly realized that when she had got up, he was, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: not beside her in bed. She ran back to the bedstead and began, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: groping with her hands, but the bed was really empty. Then he, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: must have gone out—where? She ran to the steps and timidly, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: called him. She got no answer, of course, but she caught the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: sound of groans far away in the garden in the darkness. She, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: saw that the gate into the garden was open., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: “Lord, preserve us from harm!” Marfa Ignatyevna murmured,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: But she found him not by the fence where he had been knocked, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: down, but about twenty paces off. It appeared later, that he had, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: crawled away on coming to himself, and probably had been a, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: long time getting so far, losing consciousness several times. She, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: noticed at once that he was covered with blood, and screamed at, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: window was open and that there was a candle alight in the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: window, she ran there and began calling Fyodor Pavlovitch. But, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: peeping in at the window, she saw a fearful sight. Her master, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: was lying on his back, motionless, on the floor. His light-colored, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: away from the window, ran out of the garden, drew the bolt of, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: incoherently, managed to tell them the main fact, and to beg, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: diffusely Mitya told them everything about the signals invented, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: what every tap on the window meant, tapped the signals on the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: Mitya, had tapped the signal “Grushenka has come,” when he, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: one could behave like that to him, Mitya Karamazov. What was, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: worst of all, there was something humiliating in it, and on their, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: side something “supercilious and scornful.” It was nothing to take, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: off his coat, but he was asked to undress further, or rather not, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: were clothed, while he was naked, and strange to say, when he, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: was undressed he felt somehow guilty in their presence, and was, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: almost ready to believe himself that he was inferior to them, and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: were very dirty, and so were his underclothes, and now every, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: darted up and flew past. The boys rushed to Kolya. He lay, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: without moving. They began pulling at him, lifting him up. He, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: alarmed at last, promised on his honor that such pranks should, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: never be repeated. He swore on his knees before the holy image,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and swore by the memory of his father, at Madame Krassotkin's, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: instance, and the “manly” Kolya burst into tears like a boy of, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: six. And all that day the mother and son were constantly rushing, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: into each other's arms sobbing. Next day Kolya woke up as, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: “unfeeling” as before, but he had become more silent, more, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: Six weeks later, it is true, he got into another scrape, which, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: even brought his name to the ears of our Justice of the Peace, but, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: it was a scrape of quite another kind, amusing, foolish, and he, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: did not, as it turned out, take the leading part in it, but was only, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: implicated in it. But of this later. His mother still fretted and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: trembled, but the more uneasy she became, the greater were the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: hopes of Dardanelov. It must be noted that Kolya understood and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: divined what was in Dardanelov's heart and, of course, despised, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: him profoundly for his “feelings”; he had in the past been so, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: tactless as to show this contempt before his mother, hinting, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: vaguely that he knew what Dardanelov was after. But from the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: time of the railway incident his behavior in this respect also was, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: changed; he did not allow himself the remotest allusion to the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: him most was his being so short; he did not mind so much, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: his “hideous” face, as being so short. On the wall in a corner, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: at home he had the year before made a pencil-mark to show, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: his height, and every two months since he anxiously measured, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: himself against it to see how much he had gained. But alas!, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: he grew very slowly, and this sometimes reduced him almost to, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: despair. His face was in reality by no means “hideous”; on the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: contrary, it was rather attractive, with a fair, pale skin, freckled., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: His small, lively gray eyes had a fearless look, and often glowed, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: and he always left it with indignation. “But perhaps I haven't got, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: a clever face?” he sometimes thought, doubtful even of that. But, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: it must not be supposed that his mind was preoccupied with his, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: before the looking-glass were to him, he quickly forgot them,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and forgot them for a long time, “abandoning himself entirely to, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: ideas and to real life,” as he formulated it to himself., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Alyosha came out quickly and hastened up to Kolya. Before, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: We may note here, in passing, that Alyosha's appearance had, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: undergone a complete change since we saw him last. He had, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: abandoned his cassock and was wearing now a well-cut coat, a, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: soft, round hat, and his hair had been cropped short. All this, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: was very becoming to him, and he looked quite handsome. His, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: charming face always had a good-humored expression; but there, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: was a gentleness and serenity in his good-humor. To Kolya's, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: surprise, Alyosha came out to him just as he was, without an, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: “There were reasons which you shall know directly. Anyway,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: I am glad to make your acquaintance. I've long been hoping for, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: I've heard, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: asked you to come out here for, to explain the whole episode, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: to you before we go in,” he began with animation. “You see,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Karamazov, Ilusha came into the preparatory class last spring., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Well, you know what our preparatory class is—a lot of small, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: boys. They began teasing Ilusha at once. I am two classes higher, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: up, and, of course, I only look on at them from a distance. I saw, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: the boy was weak and small, but he wouldn't give in to them;, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: he fought with them. I saw he was proud, and his eyes were, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: full of fire. I like children like that. And they teased him all the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: more. The worst of it was he was horribly dressed at the time,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: his breeches were too small for him, and there were holes in his, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: boots. They worried him about it; they jeered at him. That I can't, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: stand. I stood up for him at once, and gave it to them hot. I, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: beat them, but they adore me, do you know, Karamazov?” Kolya, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: to-day. So they left off beating Ilusha and I took him under my, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: protection. I saw the boy was proud. I tell you that, the boy was, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: proud; but in the end he became slavishly devoted to me: he did, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: my slightest bidding, obeyed me as though I were God, tried to, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: I am teaching him, developing him. Why shouldn't I develop him, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: your character, which I knew by hearsay, attracted me more than, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: anything. Let us get to the point, though. I noticed that there was, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: a sort of softness and sentimentality coming over the boy, and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: you know I have a positive hatred of this sheepish sentimentality,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and I have had it from a baby. There were contradictions in him,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: too: he was proud, but he was slavishly devoted to me, and yet, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: [601], Font: Times-Roman, Size: 7.970099925994873
Text: all at once his eyes would flash and he'd refuse to agree with me;, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: he'd argue, fly into a rage. I used sometimes to propound certain, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: ideas; I could see that it was not so much that he disagreed with, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: the ideas, but that he was simply rebelling against me, because, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: I was cool in responding to his endearments. And so, in order, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: to train him properly, the tenderer he was, the colder I became., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: I did it on purpose: that was my idea. My object was to form, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: his character, to lick him into shape, to make a man of him, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: ..., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and besides ..., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: no doubt, you understand me at a word., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Suddenly I noticed for three days in succession he was downcast, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and dejected, not because of my coldness, but for something else,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: something more important. I wondered what the tragedy was., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: I have pumped him and found out that he had somehow got to, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: know Smerdyakov, who was footman to your late father—it was, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: before his death, of course—and he taught the little fool a silly, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: trick—that is, a brutal, nasty trick. He told him to take a piece, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: of bread, to stick a pin in it, and throw it to one of those hungry, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: dogs who snap up anything without biting it, and then to watch, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and see what would happen. So they prepared a piece of bread, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: like that and threw it to Zhutchka, that shaggy dog there's been, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: such a fuss about. The people of the house it belonged to never, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: fed it at all, though it barked all day. (Do you like that stupid, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: barking, Karamazov? I can't stand it.) So it rushed at the bread,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: swallowed it, and began to squeal; it turned round and round, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and ran away, squealing as it ran out of sight. That was Ilusha's, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: own account of it. He confessed it to me, and cried bitterly. He, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: The Brothers Karamazov, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: hugged me, shaking all over. He kept on repeating ‘He ran away, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: squealing’: the sight of that haunted him. He was tormented by, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: remorse, I could see that. I took it seriously. I determined to, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: give him a lesson for other things as well. So I must confess I, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: wasn't quite straightforward, and pretended to be more indignant, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: perhaps than I was. ‘You've done a nasty thing,’ I said, ‘you are, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: a scoundrel. I won't tell of it, of course, but I shall have nothing, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: more to do with you for a time. I'll think it over and let you, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: know through Smurov’—that's the boy who's just come with me;, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: he's always ready to do anything for me—‘whether I will have, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: anything to do with you in the future or whether I give you up for, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: good as a scoundrel.’ He was tremendously upset. I must own I, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: felt I'd gone too far as I spoke, but there was no help for it. I, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: [602], Font: Times-Roman, Size: 7.970099925994873
Text: did what I thought best at the time. A day or two after, I sent, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Smurov to tell him that I would not speak to him again. That's, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: what we call it when two schoolfellows refuse to have anything, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: more to do with one another. Secretly I only meant to send him, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: to Coventry for a few days and then, if I saw signs of repentance,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: to hold out my hand to him again. That was my intention. But, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: what do you think happened? He heard Smurov's message, his, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: eyes flashed. ‘Tell Krassotkin from me,’ he cried, ‘that I will, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: throw bread with pins to all the dogs—all—all of them!’ ‘So he's, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: going in for a little temper. We must smoke it out of him.’ And I, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: began to treat him with contempt; whenever I met him I turned, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: away or smiled sarcastically. And just then that affair with his, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: father happened. You remember? You must realize that he was, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: fearfully worked up by what had happened already. The boys,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: seeing I'd given him up, set on him and taunted him, shouting,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: ‘Wisp of tow, wisp of tow!’ And he had soon regular skirmishes, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: with them, which I am very sorry for. They seem to have given, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: him one very bad beating. One day he flew at them all as they, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: Troy. This was a good time ago, but he felt uneasy and could, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: not bring himself to announce publicly that he too knew who had, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: founded Troy, afraid of what might happen and of Krassotkin's, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: somehow putting him to shame over it. But now he couldn't, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: resist saying it. For weeks he had been longing to., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: “Well, who did found it?” asked Kolya, turning to him with, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: haughty superciliousness. He saw from his face that he really did, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: know and at once made up his mind how to take it. There was,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: so to speak, a discordant note in the general harmony., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: “Troy was founded by Teucer, Dardanus, Ilius and Tros,”, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: the boy rapped out at once, and in the same instant he blushed,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: blushed so, that it was painful to look at him. But the boys stared, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: at him, stared at him for a whole minute, and then all the staring, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: eyes turned at once and were fastened upon Kolya, who was still, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: scanning the audacious boy with disdainful composure., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: There was laughter. The offending boy turned from pink to, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: crimson. He was silent and on the point of tears. Kolya held him, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: so for a minute., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: “Before you talk of a historical event like the foundation of, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: a nationality, you must first understand what you mean by it,”, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: he admonished him in stern, incisive tones. “But I attach no, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: company generally., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: “Yes, universal history! It's the study of the successive follies, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: of mankind and nothing more. The only subjects I respect are, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: mathematics and natural science,” said Kolya. He was showing, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: off and he stole a glance at Alyosha; his was the only opinion he, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: was afraid of there. But Alyosha was still silent and still serious, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: as before. If Alyosha had said a word it would have stopped him,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: but Alyosha was silent and “it might be the silence of contempt,”, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and that finally irritated Kolya., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: “The classical languages, too ... they are simply madness,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: “The study of the classics, if you ask my opinion, is simply a, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: police measure, that's simply why it has been introduced into our, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: schools.” By degrees Kolya began to get breathless again. “Latin, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and Greek were introduced because they are a bore and because, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: they stupefy the intellect. It was dull before, so what could they, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: do to make things duller? It was senseless enough before, so, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: Greek and Latin. That's my opinion, I hope I shall never change, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: “That's true,” assented Smurov suddenly, in a ringing tone of, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: “Well, all the classical authors have been translated into all, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: herself together and assumed a dignified air. Alyosha went up, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: own it to this day, and declares he had no idea. But he says that, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: on purpose. Pyotr Ilyitch began to laugh at once, and fell to criti-, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: cizing it. ‘Wretched doggerel,’ he said they were, ‘some divinity, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: to say it, but I don't wish to see you in my house again.’ So I, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: turned him out. Ah! Alexey Fyodorovitch, I know myself I did, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: it? He must have written it. He went home, sat down, wrote it on, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: or rather when he was conscious, but did not know what he was, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: what a blessing reformed law courts are. I knew nothing about, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: nowadays?—you, I, all of us are in a state of aberration, and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: By the way, let us say a word or two of Ivan's feeling to his, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: times a compassion for him, and even that was mixed with great, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: contempt, almost repugnance. Mitya's whole personality, even, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: he went to see Mitya on the first day of his arrival, and that, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: interview, far from shaking Ivan's belief in his guilt, positively, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: of the charges against him; he was continually firing up and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: abusing every one. He only laughed contemptuously at Grigory's, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: evidence about the open door, and declared that it was “the devil, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: that this was not yet the case, in the full sense of the word, but, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: that certain abnormalities were perceptible. Ivan decided to find, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: only momentary. For the rest of the time he was struck, on the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: contrary, by Smerdyakov's composure. From the first glance, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Ivan had no doubt that he was very ill. He was very weak; he, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: spoke slowly, seeming to move his tongue with difficulty; he, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: was much thinner and sallower. Throughout the interview, which, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: himself unchanged. “It's always worth while speaking to a clever, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: stool at his feet. Smerdyakov, with painful effort, shifted his, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: gone a dozen steps along the corridor, he suddenly felt that there, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: was an insulting significance in Smerdyakov's last words. He, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: Smerdyakov, but Mitya, who had committed the murder, though, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: to analyze the reason for this feeling, and even felt a positive, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: of no importance, Fenya and her mother, for instance, but the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: at the tavern, and at Plotnikov's shop, as well as the witnesses, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: Ivan so plainly. This was what he had called to Alyosha “lies, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: covered with a cloth with pink patterns on it. There was a pot of, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: geranium on each of the two little windows. In the corner there, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: with many dents in it, and a tray with two cups. But Smerdyakov, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: jauntily in front, and was plastered down at the sides. He was, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: sitting in a parti-colored, wadded dressing-gown, rather dirty and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: It was over-heated as before, but there were changes in the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: there was hardly room to move. On the table lay a thick book, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: in yellow cover, but Smerdyakov was not reading it. He seemed, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: to be sitting doing nothing. He met Ivan with a slow silent gaze,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and was apparently not at all surprised at his coming. There was, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: a great change in his face; he was much thinner and sallower., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: Smerdyakov, as before, watched him curiously, with no sign, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: of fear. He could still scarcely get over his incredulity; he still, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: fancied that Ivan knew everything and was trying to “throw it all, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: on him to his face.”, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: “Wait a minute,” he said at last in a weak voice, and suddenly, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: bringing up his left leg from under the table, he began turning, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: up his trouser leg. He was wearing long white stockings and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: slippers. Slowly he took off his garter and fumbled to the bottom, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: of his stocking. Ivan gazed at him, and suddenly shuddered in a, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: paroxysm of terror., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: “He's mad!” he cried, and rapidly jumping up, he drew back,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: so that he knocked his back against the wall and stood up against, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: it, stiff and straight. He looked with insane terror at Smerdyakov,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: who, entirely unaffected by his terror, continued fumbling in, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: his stocking, as though he were making an effort to get hold of, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: something with his fingers and pull it out. At last he got hold of, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: it and began pulling it out. Ivan saw that it was a piece of paper,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: or perhaps a roll of papers. Smerdyakov pulled it out and laid it, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: on the table., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: 809, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: low tone., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Ivan stepped up to the table, took up the roll of paper and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: “Your hands keep twitching,” observed Smerdyakov, and he, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: strange grin., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: once more., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: “No, I did not know. I kept thinking of Dmitri. Brother,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: “Listen. Did you kill him alone? With my brother's help or, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: “You were bold enough then. You said ‘everything was law-, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: surprise. “Won't you have some lemonade? I'll ask for some at, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: once. It's very refreshing. Only I must hide this first.”, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: And again he motioned at the notes. He was just going to get, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: up and call at the door to Marya Kondratyevna to make some, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: lemonade and bring it them, but, looking for something to cover, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: up the notes that she might not see them, he first took out his, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: handkerchief, and as it turned out to be very dirty, took up the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: “You'd better take off your greatcoat, or you'll be too hot.”, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Ivan, as though he'd only just thought of it, took off his coat, and,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: most natural way, following your very words.”, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: “Ah! Then you intended to worry me all my life afterwards,”, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: snarled Ivan. “And what if I hadn't gone away then, but had, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: informed against you?”, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: “What could you have informed? That I persuaded you to go, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: to Tchermashnya? That's all nonsense. Besides, after our conver-, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: that you didn't want it done, and should have attempted nothing., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: As you went away, it meant you assured me that you wouldn't, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: dare to inform against me at the trial, and that you'd overlook, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: my having the three thousand. And, indeed, you couldn't have, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: prosecuted me afterwards, because then I should have told it all, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: in the court; that is, not that I had stolen the money or killed, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: him—I shouldn't have said that—but that you'd put me up to the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: theft and the murder, though I didn't consent to it. That's why, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: I needed your consent, so that you couldn't have cornered me, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: afterwards, for what proof could you have had? I could always, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: have cornered you, revealing your eagerness for your father's, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: death, and I tell you the public would have believed it all, and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: “To be sure you were, and by your consent you silently sanc-, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: was very weak and spoke slowly and wearily, but some hidden, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: inner force urged him on. He evidently had some design. Ivan, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: felt that., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: “Go on,” he said. “Tell me what happened that night.”, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: suddenly got up and came out, and he suddenly gave a scream,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and then all was silence and darkness. I lay there waiting, my, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: 814, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: The Brothers Karamazov, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: the window open on the left into the garden, and I stepped to the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: left to listen whether he was sitting there alive, and I heard the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: master moving about, sighing, so I knew he was alive. ‘Ech!’ I, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: thought. I went to the window and shouted to the master, ‘It's, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: I.’ And he shouted to me, ‘He's been, he's been; he's run away.’, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: He meant Dmitri Fyodorovitch had been. ‘He's killed Grigory!’, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: ‘Where?’ I whispered. ‘There, in the corner,’ he pointed. He, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: was whispering, too. ‘Wait a bit,’ I said. I went to the corner of, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: the garden to look, and there I came upon Grigory Vassilyevitch, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: lying by the wall, covered with blood, senseless. So it's true that, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Dmitri Fyodorovitch has been here, was the thought that came, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: into my head, and I determined on the spot to make an end of, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: it, as Grigory Vassilyevitch, even if he were alive, would see, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: nothing of it, as he lay there senseless. The only risk was that, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Marfa Ignatyevna might wake up. I felt that at the moment, but, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: the longing to get it done came over me, till I could scarcely, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: breathe. I went back to the window to the master and said, ‘She's, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: here, she's come; Agrafena Alexandrovna has come, wants to, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: be let in.’ And he started like a baby. ‘Where is she?’ he fairly, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: gasped, but couldn't believe it. ‘She's standing there,’ said I., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: ‘Open.’ He looked out of the window at me, half believing and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: half distrustful, but afraid to open. ‘Why, he is afraid of me, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: now,’ I thought. And it was funny. I bethought me to knock on, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: the window-frame those taps we'd agreed upon as a signal that, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Grushenka had come, in his presence, before his eyes. He didn't, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: seem to believe my word, but as soon as he heard the taps, he, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: ran at once to open the door. He opened it. I would have gone, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: in, but he stood in the way to prevent me passing. ‘Where is, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: she? Where is she?’ He looked at me, all of a tremble. ‘Well,’, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: thought I, ‘if he's so frightened of me as all that, it's a bad look, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: out!’ And my legs went weak with fright that he wouldn't let, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: me in or would call out, or Marfa Ignatyevna would run up, or, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: something else might happen. I don't remember now, but I must, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: have stood pale, facing him. I whispered to him, ‘Why, she's, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: 815, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: there, there, under the window; how is it you don't see her?’ I, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: [711], Font: Times-Roman, Size: 7.970099925994873
Text: said. ‘Bring her then, bring her.’ ‘She's afraid,’ said I; ‘she was, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: frightened at the noise, she's hidden in the bushes; go and call, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: to her yourself from the study.’ He ran to the window, put the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: candle in the window. ‘Grushenka,’ he cried, ‘Grushenka, are, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: you here?’ Though he cried that, he didn't want to lean out of, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: the window, he didn't want to move away from me, for he was, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: panic-stricken; he was so frightened he didn't dare to turn his, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: back on me. ‘Why, here she is,’ said I. I went up to the window, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and leaned right out of it. ‘Here she is; she's in the bush, laughing, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: at you, don't you see her?’ He suddenly believed it; he was all of, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: a shake—he was awfully crazy about her—and he leaned right, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: out of the window. I snatched up that iron paper-weight from, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: his table; do you remember, weighing about three pounds? I, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: swung it and hit him on the top of the skull with the corner of, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: it. He didn't even cry out. He only sank down suddenly, and I, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: hit him again and a third time. And the third time I knew I'd, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: broken his skull. He suddenly rolled on his back, face upwards,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: covered with blood. I looked round. There was no blood on, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: me, not a spot. I wiped the paper-weight, put it back, went up, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: to the ikons, took the money out of the envelope, and flung the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: envelope on the floor and the pink ribbon beside it. I went out, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: into the garden all of a tremble, straight to the apple-tree with a, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: hollow in it—you know that hollow. I'd marked it long before, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and put a rag and a piece of paper ready in it. I wrapped all the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: notes in the rag and stuffed it deep down in the hole. And there, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: it stayed for over a fortnight. I took it out later, when I came out, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: of the hospital. I went back to my bed, lay down and thought,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: ‘If Grigory Vassilyevitch has been killed outright it may be a, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: bad job for me, but if he is not killed and recovers, it will be, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: first-rate, for then he'll bear witness that Dmitri Fyodorovitch has, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: been here, and so he must have killed him and taken the money.’, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Then I began groaning with suspense and impatience, so as to, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: wake Marfa Ignatyevna as soon as possible. At last she got up, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: 816, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: The Brothers Karamazov, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and she rushed to me, but when she saw Grigory Vassilyevitch, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: was not there, she ran out, and I heard her scream in the garden., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: And that set it all going and set my mind at rest.”, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: He stopped. Ivan had listened all the time in dead silence, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: without stirring or taking his eyes off him. As he told his story, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Smerdyakov glanced at him from time to time, but for the most, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: [712], Font: Times-Roman, Size: 7.970099925994873
Text: part kept his eyes averted. When he had finished he was evidently, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: agitated and was breathing hard. The perspiration stood out on, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: his face. But it was impossible to tell whether it was remorse he, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: was feeling, or what., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: “Stay,” cried Ivan, pondering. “What about the door? If he, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: only opened the door to you, how could Grigory have seen it, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: open before? For Grigory saw it before you went.”, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: It was remarkable that Ivan spoke quite amicably, in a differ-, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: ent tone, not angry as before, so if any one had opened the door, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: at that moment and peeped in at them, he would certainly have, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: concluded that they were talking peaceably about some ordinary,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: though interesting, subject., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: “As for that door and Grigory Vassilyevitch's having seen it, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: open, that's only his fancy,” said Smerdyakov, with a wry smile., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: “He is not a man, I assure you, but an obstinate mule. He didn't, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: see it, but fancied he had seen it, and there's no shaking him. It's, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: just our luck he took that notion into his head, for they can't fail, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: to convict Dmitri Fyodorovitch after that.”, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: “Listen ...” said Ivan, beginning to seem bewildered again and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: making an effort to grasp something. “Listen. There are a lot of, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: questions I want to ask you, but I forget them ... I keep forgetting, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and getting mixed up. Yes. Tell me this at least, why did you, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: open the envelope and leave it there on the floor? Why didn't, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: you simply carry off the envelope?... When you were telling me,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: I thought you spoke about it as though it were the right thing to, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: do ... but why, I can't understand....”, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: “I did that for a good reason. For if a man had known all, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: about it, as I did for instance, if he'd seen those notes before, and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: 817, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: perhaps had put them in that envelope himself, and had seen the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: envelope sealed up and addressed, with his own eyes, if such a, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: man had done the murder, what should have made him tear open, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: the envelope afterwards, especially in such desperate haste, since, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: he'd know for certain the notes must be in the envelope? No, if, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: the robber had been some one like me, he'd simply have put the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: envelope straight in his pocket and got away with it as fast as he, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: could. But it'd be quite different with Dmitri Fyodorovitch. He, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: only knew about the envelope by hearsay; he had never seen it,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and if he'd found it, for instance, under the mattress, he'd have, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: [713], Font: Times-Roman, Size: 7.970099925994873
Text: torn it open as quickly as possible to make sure the notes were, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: in it. And he'd have thrown the envelope down, without having, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: time to think that it would be evidence against him. Because he, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: was not an habitual thief and had never directly stolen anything, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: before, for he is a gentleman born, and if he did bring himself to, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: steal, it would not be regular stealing, but simply taking what was, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: his own, for he'd told the whole town he meant to before, and had, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: even bragged aloud before every one that he'd go and take his, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: property from Fyodor Pavlovitch. I didn't say that openly to the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: prosecutor when I was being examined, but quite the contrary,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: I brought him to it by a hint, as though I didn't see it myself,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: The snowstorm was still raging. He walked the first few steps, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: boldly, but suddenly began staggering. “It's something physical,”, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: he thought with a grin. Something like joy was springing up in, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: peasant to the police-station, promising him three roubles. The, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: succeeded in his object, bringing the peasant to the police-station, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and arranging for a doctor to see him at once, providing with a, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: liberal hand for the expenses. I will only say that this business, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: but did not touch it. He sat on the sofa and felt giddy. He felt, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: that he was ill and helpless. He was beginning to drop asleep,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: district court., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: I hasten to emphasize the fact that I am far from esteeming, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: myself capable of reporting all that took place at the trial in full, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: detail, or even in the actual order of events. I imagine that to, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: mention everything with full explanation would fill a volume,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: even a very large one. And so I trust I may not be reproached, for, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: confining myself to what struck me. I may have selected as of, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: most interest what was of secondary importance, and may have, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: omitted the most prominent and essential details. But I see I shall, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: do better not to apologize. I will do my best and the reader will, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: see for himself that I have done all I can., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: And, to begin with, before entering the court, I will mention, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: what surprised me most on that day., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Indeed, as it appeared, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: later, every one was surprised at it, too. We all knew that the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: affair had aroused great interest, that every one was burning with, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: impatience for the trial to begin, that it had been a subject of talk,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: conjecture, exclamation and surmise for the last two months in, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: local society. Every one knew, too, that the case had become, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: known throughout Russia, but yet we had not imagined that it, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: had aroused such burning, such intense, interest in every one, not, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: only among ourselves, but all over Russia. This became evident, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: at the trial this day., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Visitors had arrived not only from the chief town of our, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: province, but from several other Russian towns, as well as from, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Moscow and Petersburg. Among them were lawyers, ladies, and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: even several distinguished personages. Every ticket of admission, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: lowed before., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: A large proportion—not less than half of the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: from all parts that they did not know where to seat them, for every, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: ticket had long since been eagerly sought for and distributed., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: I saw at the end of the room, behind the platform, a special, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: partition hurriedly put up, behind which all these lawyers were, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: admitted, and they thought themselves lucky to have standing, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: room there, for all chairs had been removed for the sake of space,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and the crowd behind the partition stood throughout the case, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: closely packed, shoulder to shoulder., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Some of the ladies, especially those who came from a distance,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: made their appearance in the gallery very smartly dressed, but the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: majority of the ladies were oblivious even of dress. Their faces, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: betrayed hysterical, intense, almost morbid, curiosity. A peculiar, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: fact—established afterwards by many observations—was that, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: almost all the ladies, or, at least the vast majority of them, were, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: on Mitya's side and in favor of his being acquitted. This was, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: perhaps chiefly owing to his reputation as a conqueror of female, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: hearts. It was known that two women rivals were to appear in, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: the case. One of them—Katerina Ivanovna—was an object of, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: general interest. All sorts of extraordinary tales were told about, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: her, amazing anecdotes of her passion for Mitya, in spite of his, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: crime. Her pride and “aristocratic connections” were particularly, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: insisted upon (she had called upon scarcely any one in the town)., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: People said she intended to petition the Government for leave, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: to accompany the criminal to Siberia and to be married to him, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: somewhere in the mines. The appearance of Grushenka in court, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: was awaited with no less impatience. The public was looking for-, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: ward with anxious curiosity to the meeting of the two rivals—the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: more familiar figure to the ladies of the district than Katerina, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Ivanovna. They had already seen “the woman who had ruined, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Fyodor Pavlovitch and his unhappy son,” and all, almost without, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: [745], Font: Times-Roman, Size: 7.970099925994873
Text: In brief, there was a great deal of talk. I know for a fact that, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: there were several serious family quarrels on Mitya's account in, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: our town. Many ladies quarreled violently with their husbands, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: over differences of opinion about the dreadful case, and it was, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: only natural that the husbands of these ladies, far from being, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: favorably disposed to the prisoner, should enter the court bitterly, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: prejudiced against him. In fact, one may say pretty certainly that, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: the masculine, as distinguished from the feminine, part of the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: audience were biased against the prisoner. There were numbers, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: of severe, frowning, even vindictive faces. Mitya, indeed, had, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: managed to offend many people during his stay in the town., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Some of the visitors were, of course, in excellent spirits and quite, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: unconcerned as to the fate of Mitya personally. But all were, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: interested in the trial, and the majority of the men were certainly, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: hoping for the conviction of the criminal, except perhaps the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: lawyers, who were more interested in the legal than in the moral, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: aspect of the case., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Everybody was excited at the presence of the celebrated, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: lawyer, Fetyukovitch. His talent was well known, and this was, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: not the first time he had defended notorious criminal cases in, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: the provinces. And if he defended them, such cases became, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: celebrated and long remembered all over Russia. There were, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: stories, too, about our prosecutor and about the President of the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Court. It was said that Ippolit Kirillovitch was in a tremor at, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: meeting Fetyukovitch, and that they had been enemies from the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: beginning of their careers in Petersburg, that though our sensitive, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: by some one in Petersburg because his talents had not been, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: The Brothers Karamazov, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: properly appreciated, was keenly excited over the Karamazov, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: case, and was even dreaming of rebuilding his flagging fortunes, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: by means of it, Fetyukovitch, they said, was his one anxiety. But, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: these rumors were not quite just. Our prosecutor was not one of, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: those men who lose heart in face of danger. On the contrary, his, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: self-confidence increased with the increase of danger. It must be, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: noted that our prosecutor was in general too hasty and morbidly, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: impressionable. He would put his whole soul into some case, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and work at it as though his whole fate and his whole fortune, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: depended on its result. This was the subject of some ridicule in, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: the legal world, for just by this characteristic our prosecutor had, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: gained a wider notoriety than could have been expected from his, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: [746], Font: Times-Roman, Size: 7.970099925994873
Text: modest position. People laughed particularly at his passion for, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: psychology. In my opinion, they were wrong, and our prosecutor, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: was, I believe, a character of greater depth than was generally, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: supposed. But with his delicate health he had failed to make his, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: mark at the outset of his career and had never made up for it later., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: As for the President of our Court, I can only say that he was a, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: humane and cultured man, who had a practical knowledge of his, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: work and progressive views. He was rather ambitious, but did, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: not concern himself greatly about his future career. The great aim, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: of his life was to be a man of advanced ideas. He was, too, a man, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: of connections and property. He felt, as we learnt afterwards,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: rather strongly about the Karamazov case, but from a social, not, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: from a personal standpoint. He was interested in it as a social, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: phenomenon, in its classification and its character as a product, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: of our social conditions, as typical of the national character, and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: so on, and so on. His attitude to the personal aspect of the case,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: to its tragic significance and the persons involved in it, including, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: the prisoner, was rather indifferent and abstract, as was perhaps, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: fitting, indeed., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: The court was packed and overflowing long before the judges, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: I don't remember. In the body of the hall, at some distance, came, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: the seats for the public. But in front of the balustrade a few chairs, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: stout, thick-set man of fifty, with a dyspeptic complexion, dark, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: hair turning gray and cut short, and a red ribbon, of what Order I, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: don't remember. The prosecutor struck me and the others, too, as, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: looking particularly pale, almost green. His face seemed to have, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: grown suddenly thinner, perhaps in a single night, for I had seen, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: him looking as usual only two days before. The President began, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: with asking the court whether all the jury were present., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: But I see I can't go on like this, partly because some things I, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: did not hear, others I did not notice, and others I have forgotten,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: the four officials in the jury were, in fact, men of no consequence, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and of low rank. Except one who was rather younger, they were, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: gray-headed men, little known in society, who had vegetated, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: on a pitiful salary, and who probably had elderly, unpresentable, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: wives and crowds of children, perhaps even without shoes and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: stockings. At most, they spent their leisure over cards and, of, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: course, had never read a single book. The two merchants looked, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: respectable, but were strangely silent and stolid. One of them, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: was close-shaven, and was dressed in European style; the other, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: had a small, gray beard, and wore a red ribbon with some sort, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: of a medal upon it on his neck. There is no need to speak of the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: artisans and the peasants. The artisans of Skotoprigonyevsk are, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: almost peasants, and even work on the land. Two of them also, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: wore European dress, and, perhaps for that reason, were dirtier, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and more uninviting-looking than the others. So that one might, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: well wonder, as I did as soon as I had looked at them, “what men, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: like that could possibly make of such a case?” Yet their faces, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: made a strangely imposing, almost menacing, impression; they, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: At last the President opened the case of the murder of Fyodor, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Pavlovitch Karamazov. I don't quite remember how he described, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: him. The court usher was told to bring in the prisoner, and Mitya, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: made his appearance. There was a hush through the court. One, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: could have heard a fly. I don't know how it was with others, but, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Mitya made a most unfavorable impression on me. He looked, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: an awful dandy in a brand-new frock-coat. I heard afterwards, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: strides, looking stiffly straight in front of him, and sat down in, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: Fetyukovitch, entered, and a sort of subdued hum passed through, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: the court. He was a tall, spare man, with long thin legs, with, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: extremely long, thin, pale fingers, clean-shaven face, demurely, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: brushed, rather short hair, and thin lips that were at times curved, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: into something between a sneer and a smile. He looked about, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: forty. His face would have been pleasant, if it had not been, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: for his eyes, which, in themselves small and inexpressive, were, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: set remarkably close together, with only the thin, long nose as, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: a dividing line between them., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: In fact, there was something, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: strikingly birdlike about his face. He was in evening dress and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: white tie., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: I remember the President's first questions to Mitya, about his, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: name, his calling, and so on. Mitya answered sharply, and his, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: voice was so unexpectedly loud that it made the President start, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and look at the prisoner with surprise. Then followed a list of, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: persons who were to take part in the proceedings—that is, of the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: witnesses and experts. It was a long list. Four of the witnesses, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: were not present—Miüsov, who had given evidence at the pre-, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: liminary inquiry, but was now in Paris; Madame Hohlakov and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Maximov, who were absent through illness; and Smerdyakov,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: through his sudden death, of which an official statement from the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: police was presented. The news of Smerdyakov's death produced, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: a sudden stir and whisper in the court. Many of the audience, of, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: course, had not heard of the sudden suicide. What struck people, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: most was Mitya's sudden outburst As soon as the statement of, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: [749], Font: Times-Roman, Size: 7.970099925994873

Text: “He was a dog and died like a dog!”, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: I remember how his counsel rushed to him, and how the Presi-, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: 858, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: regret:, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: “I won't again, I won't. It escaped me. I won't do it again.”, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: And, of course, this brief episode did him no good with the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: jury or the public. His character was displayed, and it spoke for, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: itself. It was under the influence of this incident that the opening, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: statement was read. It was rather short, but circumstantial. It, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: only stated the chief reasons why he had been arrested, why he, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: must be tried, and so on. Yet it made a great impression on me., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: The clerk read it loudly and distinctly. The whole tragedy was, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: suddenly unfolded before us, concentrated, in bold relief, in a, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: fatal and pitiless light. I remember how, immediately after it had, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: been read, the President asked Mitya in a loud impressive voice:, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: “Prisoner, do you plead guilty?”, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Mitya suddenly rose from his seat., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: “I plead guilty to drunkenness and dissipation,” he exclaimed,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: again in a startling, almost frenzied, voice, “to idleness and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: debauchery. I meant to become an honest man for good, just at, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: the moment when I was struck down by fate. But I am not guilty, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: of the death of that old man, my enemy and my father. No, no, I, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: am not guilty of robbing him! I could not be. Dmitri Karamazov, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: is a scoundrel, but not a thief.”, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: He sat down again, visibly trembling all over. The President, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: again briefly, but impressively, admonished him to answer only, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: what was asked, and not to go off into irrelevant exclamations., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Then he ordered the case to proceed. All the witnesses were led, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: up to take the oath. Then I saw them all together. The brothers, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: of the prisoner were, however, allowed to give evidence without, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: taking the oath. After an exhortation from the priest and the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: President, the witnesses were led away and were made to sit as, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: far as possible apart from one another. Then they began calling, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: peculiar characteristic of the case was conspicuous and observed, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: by all, that is, the overwhelming strength of the prosecution, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: as compared with the arguments the defense had to rely upon., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: to group themselves round a single point, and the whole horrible, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and bloody crime was gradually revealed. Every one, perhaps,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: felt from the first that the case was beyond dispute, that there was, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: no doubt about it, that there could be really no discussion, and that, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: the defense was only a matter of form, and that the prisoner was, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: guilty, obviously and conclusively guilty. I imagine that even the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: ladies, who were so impatiently longing for the acquittal of the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: convinced of his guilt. What's more, I believe they would have, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: been mortified if his guilt had not been so firmly established, as, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: in accordance with the new ideas, the new sentiments that had, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: [751], Font: Times-Roman, Size: 7.970099925994873

Text: interested in the contest between the prosecutor and the famous, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Fetyukovitch. All were wondering and asking themselves what, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: could even a talent like Fetyukovitch's make of such a desperate, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: But Fetyukovitch remained an enigma to all up to the very, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: end, up to his speech. Persons of experience suspected that he, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: had some design, that he was working towards some object, but, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: it was almost impossible to guess what it was. His confidence, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: more than three days, perhaps, among us, had so wonderfully, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: succeeded in mastering the case and “had studied it to a nicety.”, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: People described with relish, afterwards, how cleverly he had, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: “taken down” all the witnesses for the prosecution, and as far, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: as possible perplexed them and, what's more, had aspersed their, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: reputation and so depreciated the value of their evidence. But it, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: was supposed that he did this rather by way of sport, so to speak,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: for professional glory, to show nothing had been omitted of the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: the case. Thus, for example, Trifon Borissovitch made a great, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: the street, he made them presents of twenty-five roubles each,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: at least, he didn't give them less. And what a lot of money was, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: simply stolen from him! And if any one did steal, he did not leave, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: I tell you, they used to be poor.” He recalled, in fact, every item, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: of expense and added it all up. So the theory that only fifteen, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: His remark that the prisoner ought to have looked at the ladies, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: and with erudition of “aberration” and “mania,” and argued that,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: from all the facts collected, the prisoner had undoubtedly been in, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: a condition of aberration for several days before his arrest, and,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: if the crime had been committed by him, it must, even if he were, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: irritability, using strange words, ‘Bernard!’ ‘Ethics!’ and others, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: all, in the fact that the prisoner could not even speak of the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: the last touch of comedy to the difference of opinion between the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: Herzenstube, when called as a witness, was quite unexpectedly, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: of use to Mitya. As an old resident in the town who had known, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: means but wouldn't give back that fifteen hundred. And when he, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: was arrested at Mokroe he cried out—I know, I was told it—that, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: he considered it the most disgraceful act of his life that when he, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: had the means of repaying Katerina Ivanovna half (half, note!), Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: him!” Alyosha exclaimed in conclusion., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: The prosecutor, of course, intervened. He asked Alyosha to, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: describe once more how it had all happened, and several times, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: the breast?”, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: “But it was not with his fist,” cried Alyosha; “he pointed with, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: his fingers and pointed here, very high up.... How could I have, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: so completely forgotten it till this moment?”, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: The President asked Mitya what he had to say to the last, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: witness's evidence. Mitya confirmed it, saying that he had been, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: pointing to the fifteen hundred roubles which were on his breast,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: just below the neck, and that that was, of course, the disgrace, “A, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: disgrace I cannot deny, the most shameful act of my whole life,”, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: cried Mitya. “I might have repaid it and didn't repay it. I preferred, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: to remain a thief in her eyes rather than give it back. And the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: most shameful part of it was that I knew beforehand I shouldn't, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: even though this were only one tiny bit of evidence, a mere hint, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: that the prisoner had not been lying at the preliminary inquiry, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: when he alleged at Mokroe that those fifteen hundred roubles, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: were “his own.” Alyosha was glad. With a flushed face he moved, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: away to the seat assigned to him. He kept repeating to himself:, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: “How was it I forgot? How could I have forgotten it? And what, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: The, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: a stir among the men: some stood up to get a better view., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: Everybody alleged afterwards that Mitya had turned “white as, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: a sheet” on her entrance. All in black, she advanced modestly,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: almost timidly. It was impossible to tell from her face that she, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: was agitated; but there was a resolute gleam in her dark and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: gloomy eyes. I may remark that many people mentioned that, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: expressed herself with composure, or at least tried to appear, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: [770], Font: Times-Roman, Size: 7.970099925994873
Text: very respectfully, as though afraid to touch on “certain chords,”, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and showing consideration for her great unhappiness. But in, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: answer to one of the first questions Katerina Ivanovna replied, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: firmly that she had been formerly betrothed to the prisoner, “until, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: he left me of his own accord...” she added quietly. When they, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: asked her about the three thousand she had entrusted to Mitya to, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: post to her relations, she said firmly, “I didn't give him the money, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: simply to send it off. I felt at the time that he was in great need, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: of money.... I gave him the three thousand on the understanding, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: that he should post it within the month if he cared to. There was, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: no need for him to worry himself about that debt afterwards.”, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: I will not repeat all the questions asked her and all her answers, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: in detail. I will only give the substance of her evidence., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: “I was firmly convinced that he would send off that sum as, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: soon as he got money from his father,” she went on. “I have never, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: doubted his disinterestedness and his honesty ... his scrupulous, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: honesty ... in money matters. He felt quite certain that he would, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: receive the money from his father, and spoke to me several, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: times about it. I knew he had a feud with his father and have, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: always believed that he had been unfairly treated by his father. I, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: don't remember any threat uttered by him against his father. He, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: certainly never uttered any such threat before me. If he had come, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: to me at that time, I should have at once relieved his anxiety, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: about that unlucky three thousand roubles, but he had given up, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: coming to see me ... and I myself was put in such a position ..., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: that I could not invite him.... And I had no right, indeed, to be, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: exacting as to that money,” she added suddenly, and there was a, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: ring of resolution in her voice. “I was once indebted to him for, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: assistance in money for more than three thousand, and I took it,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: although I could not at that time foresee that I should ever be in, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: She concealed this from him and said nothing about it, and that, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: No, I can never forget those moments. She began telling her, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: story. She told everything, the whole episode that Mitya had, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: told Alyosha, and her bowing to the ground, and her reason. She, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: told about her father and her going to Mitya, and did not in one, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: her sister, proposed they should “send him Katerina Ivanovna”, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: run to the young officer, relying on something ... to beg him, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: for the money. It was something tremendous! I turned cold and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: trembled as I listened. The court was hushed, trying to catch, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: upon even one question on the subject. Fetyukovitch made a, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: low bow to her. Oh, he was almost triumphant! Much ground, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: generous impulse and then for the same man to murder his father, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: for the sake of robbing him of three thousand—the idea seemed, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: too incongruous. Fetyukovitch felt that now the charge of theft,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: at least, was as good as disproved. “The case” was thrown into, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: the way to the scaffold! But it was in Katya's character, and it was, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: but this time it was for another, and perhaps only now—perhaps, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: only at this moment—she felt and knew how dear that other was, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: since that bow, that the simple-hearted Mitya, who even then, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: long and so painfully in the offended woman's breast burst out all, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: at once and unexpectedly. She betrayed Mitya, but she betrayed, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: I, too, am human; I, too, can weigh the influence of home and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: childhood on the character. But the boy grows up and becomes, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: an officer; for a duel and other reckless conduct he is exiled to, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: one of the remote frontier towns of Russia. There he led a wild, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: life as an officer. And, of course, he needed money, money, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: before all things, and so after prolonged disputes he came to a, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: “Then came his meeting with a young girl of lofty character, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and brilliant education. Oh, I do not venture to repeat the details;, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: you have only just heard them. Honor, self-sacrifice were shown, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: But the other side of the medal was unexpectedly turned to us, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: immediately after in this very court. Again I will not venture, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: to conjecture why it happened so, but there were causes. The, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: same lady, bathed in tears of long-concealed indignation, alleged, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: that he, he of all men, had despised her for her action, which,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: though incautious, reckless perhaps, was still dictated by lofty, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and generous motives. He, he, the girl's betrothed, looked at, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: her with that smile of mockery, which was more insufferable, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: from him than from any one. And knowing that he had already, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: deceived her (he had deceived her, believing that she was bound, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: to endure everything from him, even treachery), she intentionally, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: offered him three thousand roubles, and clearly, too clearly, let, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: him understand that she was offering him money to deceive her., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: The Brothers Karamazov, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: ‘Well, will you take it or not, are you so lost to shame?’ was, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: the dumb question in her scrutinizing eyes. He looked at her,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: saw clearly what was in her mind (he's admitted here before, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: you that he understood it all), appropriated that three thousand, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: unconditionally, and squandered it in two days with the new, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: a rule, between two extremes one has to find the mean, but in the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: present case this is not true. The probability is that in the first case, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: he was genuinely noble, and in the second as genuinely base. And, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: why? Because he was of the broad Karamazov character—that's, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: just what I am leading up to—capable of combining the most, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: incongruous contradictions, and capable of the greatest heights, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and of the greatest depths. Remember the brilliant remark made, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: by a young observer who has seen the Karamazov family at close, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: [793], Font: Times-Roman, Size: 7.970099925994873
Text: as essential to those reckless, unbridled natures as the sense of, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: their lofty generosity.’ And that's true, they need continually this, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: unnatural mixture. Two extremes at the same moment, or they, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: “But no, he did not touch his talisman, and what is the reason, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: when she would say, ‘I am yours, take me where you will,’ he, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: the sudden desire to make a jest of them came over her, and she, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: his eye. He had realized for a month past that any object of the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: kind would serve as a weapon, so he instantly, without hesitation,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: by three persons only—the two brothers of the prisoner and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: suspicions only to-day, when he was undoubtedly suffering from, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: personality of Smerdyakov, “who had cut short his life in a fit, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: “Moreover, Smerdyakov, whose health was shaken by his, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: are tormented by pangs of conscience, often entirely without, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: cause; they exaggerate and often invent all sorts of faults and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: crimes. And here we have a man of that type who had really been, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: driven to wrong-doing by terror and intimidation., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: “It must be observed that he looked on Ivan Fyodorovitch as, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: a protector, whose presence in the house was a guarantee that, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: one. So the doctors tell us. And so, as soon as Ivan Fyodorovitch, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: had driven out of the yard, Smerdyakov, depressed by his lonely, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: did you get the linen?’ The prisoner was positively offended, he, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: thought it almost insulting to ask him such a trivial question, and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: All was hushed as the first words of the famous orator rang out., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: The eyes of the audience were fastened upon him. He began, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: very simply and directly, with an air of conviction, but not the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: slightest trace of conceit. He made no attempt at eloquence, at, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: pathos, or emotional phrases. He was like a man speaking in a, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: circle of intimate and sympathetic friends. His voice was a fine, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: one, sonorous and sympathetic, and there was something genuine, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and simple in the very sound of it. But every one realized at, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: once that the speaker might suddenly rise to genuine pathos and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: “pierce the heart with untold power.” His language was perhaps, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: more irregular than Ippolit Kirillovitch's, but he spoke without, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: long phrases, and indeed, with more precision. One thing did, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: not please the ladies: he kept bending forward, especially at the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: beginning of his speech, not exactly bowing, but as though he, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: though, at the end, these facts formed a whole., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: His speech, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: might be divided into two parts, the first consisting of criticism, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: in refutation of the charge, sometimes malicious and sarcastic., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: But in the second half he suddenly changed his tone, and even, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: his manner, and at once rose to pathos. The audience seemed on, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: He went straight to the point, and began by saying that al-, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: provincial towns to defend prisoners, of whose innocence he had, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: a conviction or at least a preconceived idea. “That is what has, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: [822], Font: Times-Roman, Size: 7.970099925994873

Text: very first accounts in the newspapers I was struck by something, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: which strongly prepossessed me in the prisoner's favor. What in-, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: terested me most was a fact which often occurs in legal practice,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: but rarely, I think, in such an extreme and peculiar form as in, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: the present case. I ought to formulate that peculiarity only at the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: end of my speech, but I will do so at the very beginning, for it is, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: my weakness to go to work directly, not keeping my effects in, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: reserve and economizing my material. That may be imprudent on, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: my part, but at least it's sincere. What I have in my mind is this:, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: there is an overwhelming chain of evidence against the prisoner,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and at the same time not one fact that will stand criticism, if it is, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: examined separately. As I followed the case more closely in the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: papers my idea was more and more confirmed, and I suddenly, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: received from the prisoner's relatives a request to undertake his, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: defense. I at once hurried here, and here I became completely, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: convinced. It was to break down this terrible chain of facts,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and to show that each piece of evidence taken separately was, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: that he had come at last. There were about twelve of them, they, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: all had their school-bags or satchels on their shoulders. “Father, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: and his eyes closed in a blue coffin with a white frill round it., Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: His thin face was hardly changed at all, and strange to say there, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: was no smell of decay from the corpse. The expression of his, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: face was serious and, as it were, thoughtful. His hands, crossed, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: over his breast, looked particularly beautiful, as though chiseled, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: and out, was decked with flowers, which had been sent early, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: in the morning by Lise Hohlakov. But there were flowers too, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: from Katerina Ivanovna, and when Alyosha opened the door, the, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: captain had a bunch in his trembling hands and was strewing, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: them again over his dear boy. He scarcely glanced at Alyosha, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: when he came in, and he would not look at any one, even at, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: She sat with her head pressed to it and she too was no doubt, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: “Mother, make the sign of the cross over him, give him your, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: like an automaton and with a face contorted with bitter grief she, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: began, without a word, beating her breast with her fist. They, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: carried the coffin past her. Nina pressed her lips to her brother's, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: and distracted after the coffin, in his short old summer overcoat,, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: with his head bare and his soft, old, wide-brimmed hat in his, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: hand. He seemed in a state of bewildered anxiety. At one minute, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: he stretched out his hand to support the head of the coffin and, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: only hindered the bearers, at another he ran alongside and tried, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: to find a place for himself there. A flower fell on the snow and he, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: when a candle fell out of the candlestick he rushed to replace it, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: “Like the Cherubim,” he joined in the singing but did not go on, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: One of the boys observed that it was awkward for him to, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: crumble the bread with the flowers in his hands and suggested he, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422

Text: even, and made his way homewards. But his steps became more, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
Text: and more hurried, he almost ran. The boys and Alyosha kept up, Font: Times-Roman, Size: 10.909099578857422
