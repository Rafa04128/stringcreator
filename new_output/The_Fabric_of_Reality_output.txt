Text:  , Font: Helvetica-Bold, Size: 15.960000038146973
Text:  If there is a single motivation for the world-view set out in this book, it is that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: thanks largely to a succession of extraordinary scientific discoveries, we now, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: possess some extremely deep theories about the structure of reality. If we, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: are to understand the world on more than a superficial level, it must be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: through those theories and through reason, and not through our, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: preconceptions, received opinion or even common sense. Our best theories, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: are not only truer than common sense, they make far more sense than, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: common sense does. We must take them seriously, not merely as pragmatic, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: foundations for their respective fields but as explanations of the world. And I, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: believe that we can achieve the greatest understanding if we consider them, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: not singly but jointly, for they are inextricably related., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: It may seem odd that this suggestion — that we should try to form a rational, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and coherent world-view on the basis of our best, most fundamental theories, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: — should be at all novel or controversial. Yet in practice it is. One reason is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that each of these theories has, when it is taken seriously, very counter-, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: intuitive implications. Consequently, all sorts of attempts have been made to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: avoid facing those implications, by making ad hoc modifications or, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: reinterpretations of the theories, or by arbitrarily narrowing their domain of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: applicability, or simply by using them in practice but drawing no wider, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: conclusions from them. I shall criticize some of these attempts (none of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: which, I believe, has much merit), but only when this happens to be a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: convenient way of explaining the theories themselves. For this book is not, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text:  I remember being told, when I was a small child, that in ancient times it was, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: still possible for a very learned person to know everything that was known. I, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: was also told that nowadays so much is known that no one could, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: conceivably learn more than a tiny fraction of it, even in a long lifetime. The, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: latter proposition surprised and disappointed me. In fact, I refused to believe, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: it. I did not know how to justify my disbelief. But I knew that I did not want, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: things to be like that, and I envied the ancient scholars., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: It was not that I wanted to memorize all the facts that were listed in the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: world’s encyclopaedias: on the contrary, I hated memorizing facts. That is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: not the sense in which I expected it to be possible to know everything that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: was known. It would not have disappointed me to be told that more, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: publications appear every day than anyone could read in a lifetime, or that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: there are 600,000 known species of beetle. I had no wish to track the fall of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: every sparrow. Nor did I imagine that an ancient scholar who supposedly, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: knew everything that was known would have known everything of that sort. I, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: had in mind a more discriminating idea of what should count as being, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: known. By ‘known’, I meant understood., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: The idea that one person might understand everything that is understood, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: may still seem fantastic, but it is distinctly less fantastic than the idea that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: one person could memorize every known fact. For example, no one could, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: possibly memorize all known observational data on even so narrow a subject, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: as the motions of the planets, but many astronomers understand those, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: motions to the full extent that they are understood. This is possible because, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: understanding does not depend on knowing a lot of facts as such, but on, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: having the right concepts, explanations and theories. One comparatively, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: simple and comprehensible theory can cover an infinity of indigestible facts., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Our best theory of planetary motions is Einstein’s general theory of relativity,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: which early in the twentieth century superseded Newton’s theories of gravity, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and motion. It correctly predicts, in principle, not only all planetary motions, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: but also all other effects of gravity to the limits of accuracy of our best, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: measurements. For a theory to predict something ‘in principle’ means that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the predictions follow logically from the theory, even if in practice the amount, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of computation that would be needed to generate some of the predictions is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: too large to be technologically feasible, or even too large for it to be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: physically possible for us to carry it out in the universe as we find it., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Being able to predict things or to describe them, however accurately, is not, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: at all the same thing as understanding them. Predictions and descriptions in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: physics are often expressed as mathematical formulae. Suppose that I, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: memorize the formula from which I could, if I had the time and the inclination,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: calculate any planetary position that has been recorded in the astronomical, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: archives. What exactly have I gained, compared with memorizing those, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: archives directly? The formula is easier to remember — but then, looking a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: number up in the archives may be even easier than calculating it from the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: formula. The real advantage of the formula is that it can be used in an infinity, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of cases beyond the archived data, for instance to predict the results of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: future observations. It may also yield the historical positions of the planets, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: more accurately, because the archived data contain observational errors., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: Yet even though the formula summarizes infinitely more facts than the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: archives do, knowing it does not amount to understanding planetary, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: motions. Facts cannot be understood just by being summarized in a formula,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: any more than by being listed on paper or committed to memory. They can, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: be understood only by being explained. Fortunately, our best theories, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: embody deep explanations as well as accurate predictions. For example, the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: general theory of relativity explains gravity in terms of a new, four-, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: dimensional geometry of curved space and time. It explains precisely how, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: this geometry affects and is affected by matter. That explanation is the entire, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: content of the theory; predictions about planetary motions are merely some, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of the consequences that we can deduce from the explanation., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: What makes the general theory of relativity so important is not that it can, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: predict planetary motions a shade more accurately than Newton’s theory, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: can, but that it reveals and explains previously unsuspected aspects of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: reality, such as the curvature of space and time. This is typical of scientific, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explanation. Scientific theories explain the objects and phenomena of our, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: experience in terms of an underlying reality which we do not experience, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: directly. But the ability of a theory to explain what we experience is not its, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: most valuable attribute. Its most valuable attribute is that it explains the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: fabric of reality itself. As we shall see, one of the most valuable, significant, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and also useful attributes of human thought generally is its ability to reveal, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and explain the fabric of reality., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Yet some philosophers — and even some scientists — disparage the role of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explanation in science. To them, the basic purpose of a scientific theory is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: not to explain anything, but to predict the outcomes of experiments: its entire, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: content lies in its predictive formulae. They consider that any consistent, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explanation that a theory may give for its predictions is as good as any other, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: — or as good as no explanation at all — so long as the predictions are true., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: This view is called instrumentalism (because it says that a theory is no more, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: than an ‘instrument’ for making predictions). To instrumentalists, the idea, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that science can enable us to understand the underlying reality that accounts, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: for our observations is a fallacy and a conceit. They do not see how anything, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: a scientific theory may say beyond predicting the outcomes of experiments, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: can be more than empty words. Explanations, in particular, they regard as, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mere psychological props: a sort of fiction which we incorporate in theories, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to make them more easily remembered and entertaining. The Nobel prize-, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Weinberg and the other instrumentalists are mistaken. What we ascribe the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: images on astronomers’ photographic plates to does matter, and it matters, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: not only to theoretical physicists like myself, whose very motivation for, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: formulating and studying theories is the desire to understand the world, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: better. (I am sure that this is Weinberg’s motivation too: he is not really, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: driven by an urge to predict images and spectra!) For even in purely practical, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: applications, the explanatory power of a theory is paramount and its, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: predictive power only supplementary. If this seems surprising, imagine that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: an extraterrestrial scientist has visited the Earth and given us an ultra-high-, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: technology ‘oracle’ which can predict the outcome of any possible, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: experiment, but provides no explanations. According to instrumentalists,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: once we had that oracle we should have no further use for scientific theories,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: except as a means of entertaining ourselves. But is that true? How would the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: oracle be used in practice? In some sense it would contain the knowledge, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: necessary to build, say, an interstellar spaceship. But how exactly would that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: help us to build one, or to build another oracle of the same kind — or even a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: better mousetrap? The oracle only predicts the outcomes of experiments., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Therefore, in order to use it at all we must first know what experiments to ask, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: it about. If we gave it the design of a spaceship, and the details of a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: proposed test flight, it could tell us how the spaceship would perform on, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: such a flight. But it could not design the spaceship for us in the first place., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: And even if it predicted that the spaceship we had designed would explode, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: on take-off, it could not tell us how to prevent such an explosion. That would, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: still be for us to work out. And before we could work it out, before we could, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: even begin to improve the design in any way, we should have to understand,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: among other things, how the spaceship was supposed to work. Only then, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: would we have any chance of discovering what might cause an explosion on, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: take-off. Prediction — even perfect, universal prediction — is simply no, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: substitute for explanation., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Similarly, in scientific research the oracle would not provide us with any new, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theory. Not until we already had a theory, and had thought of an experiment, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that would test it, could we possibly ask the oracle what would happen if the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theory were subjected to that test. Thus, the oracle would not be replacing, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theories at all: it would be replacing experiments. It would spare us the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: expense of running laboratories and particle accelerators. Instead of building, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: prototype spaceships, and risking the lives of test pilots, we could do all the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: testing on the ground with pilots sitting in flight simulators whose behaviour, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: was controlled by the predictions of the oracle., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: The oracle would be very useful in many situations, but its usefulness would, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: always depend on people’s ability to solve scientific problems in just the way, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: they have to now, namely by devising explanatory theories. It would not, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: even replace all experimentation, because its ability to predict the outcome, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of a particular experiment would in practice depend on how easy it was to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: describe the experiment accurately enough for the oracle to give a useful, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: answer, compared with doing the experiment in reality. After all, the oracle, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: would have to have some sort of ‘user interface’. Perhaps a description of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the experiment would have to be entered into it, in some standard language., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: In that language, some experiments would be harder to specify than others., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: In practice, for many experiments the specification would be too complex to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: be entered. Thus the oracle would have the same general advantages and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: disadvantages as any other source of experimental data, and it would be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: useful only in cases where consulting it happened to be more convenient, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: than using other sources. To put that another way: there already is one such, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: oracle out there, namely the physical world. It tells us the result of any, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: possible experiment if we ask it in the right language (i.e. if we do the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: experiment), though in some cases it is impractical for us to ‘enter a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: description of the experiment’ in the required form (i.e. to build and operate, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the apparatus). But it provides no explanations., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: In a few applications, for instance weather forecasting, we may be almost as, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: satisfied with a purely predictive oracle as with an explanatory theory. But, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: even then, that would be strictly so only if the oracle’s weather forecast were, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: complete and perfect. In practice, weather forecasts are incomplete and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: imperfect, and to make up for that they include explanations of how the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: forecasters arrived at their predictions. The explanations allow us to judge, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the reliability of a forecast and to deduce further predictions relevant to our, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: own location and needs. For instance, it makes a difference to me whether, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: today’s forecast that it will be windy tomorrow is based on an expectation of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: a nearby high-pressure area, or of a more distant hurricane. I would take, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: more precautions in the latter case. Meteorologists themselves also need, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explanatory theories about weather so that they can guess what, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: approximations it is safe to incorporate in their computer simulations of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: weather, what additional observations would allow the forecast to be more, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: accurate and more timely, and so on., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Thus the instrumentalist ideal epitomized by our imaginary oracle, namely a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: scientific theory stripped of its explanatory content, would be of strictly, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: limited utility. Let us be thankful that real scientific theories do not resemble, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that ideal, and that scientists in reality do not work towards that ideal., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: An extreme form of instrumentalism, called positivism (or logical positivism),, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: holds that all statements other than those describing or predicting, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: observations are not only superfluous but meaningless. Although this, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: doctrine is itself meaningless, according to its own criterion, it was, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: nevertheless the prevailing theory of scientific knowledge during the first half, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of the twentieth century! Even today, instrumentalist and positivist ideas still, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: have currency. One reason why they are superficially plausible is that,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: although prediction is not the purpose of science, it is part of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: characteristic method of science. The scientific method involves postulating, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: a new theory to explain some class of phenomena and then performing a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: crucial experimental test, an experiment for which the old theory predicts one, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: observable outcome and the new theory another. One then rejects the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theory whose predictions turn out to be false. Thus the outcome of a crucial, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: experimental test to decide between two theories does depend on the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theories’ predictions, and not directly on their explanations. This is the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: source of the misconception that there is nothing more to a scientific theory, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: than its predictions. But experimental testing is by no means the only, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: process involved in the growth of scientific knowledge. The overwhelming, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: majority of theories are rejected because they contain bad explanations, not, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: because they fail experimental tests. We reject them without ever bothering, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to test them. For example, consider the theory that eating a kilogram of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: grass is a cure for the common cold. That theory makes experimentally, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: testable predictions: if people tried the grass cure and found it ineffective,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the theory would be proved false. But it has never been tested and probably, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: never will be, because it contains no explanation — either of how the cure, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: would work, or of anything else. We rightly presume it to be false. There are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: always infinitely many possible theories of that sort, compatible with existing, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: observations and making new predictions, so we could never have the time, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: or resources to test them all. What we test are new theories that seem to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: show promise of explaining things better than the prevailing ones do., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: To say that prediction is the purpose of a scientific theory is to confuse, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: means with ends. It is like saying that the purpose of a spaceship is to burn, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: fuel. In fact, burning fuel is only one of many things a spaceship has to do to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: accomplish its real purpose, which is to transport its payload from one point, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: in space to another. Passing experimental tests is only one of many things a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theory has to do to achieve the real purpose of science, which is to explain, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the world., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: As I have said, explanations are inevitably framed partly in terms of things, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: we do not observe directly: atoms and forces; the interiors of stars and the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: rotation of galaxies; the past and the future; the laws of nature. The deeper, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: an explanation is, the more remote from immediate experience are the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: entities to which it must refer. But these entities are not fictional: on the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: contrary, they are part of the very fabric of reality., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Explanations often yield predictions, at least in principle. Indeed, if, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: something is, in principle, predictable, then a sufficiently complete, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explanation must, in principle, make complete predictions (among other, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: things) about it. But many intrinsically unpredictable things can also be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explained and understood. For example, you cannot predict what numbers, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: will come up on a fair (i.e. unbiased) roulette wheel. But if you understand, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: what it is in the wheel’s design and operation that makes it fair, then you can, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explain why predicting the numbers is impossible. And again, merely, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: knowing that the wheel is fair is not the same as understanding what makes, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: it fair., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: It is understanding, and not mere knowing (or describing or predicting), that I, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: am discussing. Because understanding comes through explanatory theories,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and because of the generality that such theories may have, the proliferation, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of recorded facts does not necessarily make it more difficult to understand, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: everything that is understood. Nevertheless most people would say — and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: this is in effect what was being said to me on the occasion I recalled from my, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: childhood — that it is not only recorded facts which have been increasing at, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: an overwhelming rate, but also the number and complexity of the theories, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: through which we understand the world. Consequently (they say), whether or, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: not it was ever possible for one person to understand everything that was, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: understood at the time, it is certainly not possible now, and it is becoming, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: less and less possible as our knowledge grows. It might seem that every, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: time a new explanation or technique is discovered that is relevant to a given, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: subject, another theory must be added to the list that anyone wishing to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: understand that subject must learn; and that when the number of such, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theories in any one subject becomes too great, specializations develop., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Physics, for example, has split into the sciences of astrophysics,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: thermodynamics, particle physics, quantum field theory, and many others., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Each of these is based on a theoretical framework at least as rich as the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: whole of physics was a hundred years ago, and many are already, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: fragmenting into sub-specializations. The more we discover, it seems, the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: further and more irrevocably we are propelled into the age of the specialist,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and the more remote is that hypothetical ancient time when a single person’s, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: understanding might have encompassed all that was understood., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: Confronted with this vast and rapidly growing menu of the collected theories, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of the human race, one may be forgiven for doubting that an individual could, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: so much as taste every dish in a lifetime, let alone, as might once have been, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: possible, appreciate all known recipes. Yet explanation is a strange sort of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: food — a larger portion is not necessarily harder to swallow. A theory may, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: be superseded by a new theory which explains more, and is more accurate,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: but is also easier to understand, in which case the old theory becomes, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: redundant, and we gain more understanding while needing to learn less than, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: before. That is what happened when Nicolaus Copernicus’s theory of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Earth travelling round the Sun superseded the complex Ptolemaic system, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: which had placed the Earth at the centre of the universe. Or a new theory, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: may be a simplification of an existing one, as when the Arabic (decimal), Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: notation for numbers superseded Roman numerals. (The theory here is an, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: implicit one. Each notation renders certain operations, statements and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: thoughts about numbers simpler than others, and hence it embodies a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theory about which relationships between numbers are useful or interesting.), Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Or a new theory may be a unification of two old ones, giving us more, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: understanding than using the old ones side by side, as happened when, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Michael Faraday and James Clerk Maxwell unified the theories of electricity, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and magnetism into a single theory of electromagnetism. More indirectly,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: better explanations in any subject tend to improve the techniques, concepts, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and language with which we are trying to understand other subjects, and so, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: our knowledge as a whole, while increasing, can become structurally more, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: amenable to being understood., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Admittedly, it often happens that even when old theories are thus subsumed, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: into new ones, the old ones are not entirely forgotten. Even Roman, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: numerals are still used today for some purposes. The cumbersome methods, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: by which people once calculated that XIX times XVII equals CCCXXIII are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: never applied in earnest any more, but they are no doubt still known and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: understood somewhere — by historians of mathematics for instance. Does, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: this mean that one cannot understand ‘everything that is understood’ without, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: knowing Roman numerals and their arcane arithmetic? It does not. A, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: modern mathematician who for some reason had never heard of Roman, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: numerals would nevertheless already possess in full the understanding of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: their associated mathematics. By learning about Roman numerals, that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mathematician would be acquiring no new understanding, only new facts —, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: historical facts, and facts about the properties of certain arbitrarily defined, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: symbols, rather than new knowledge about numbers themselves. It would be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: like a zoologist learning to translate the names of species into a foreign, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: language, or an astrophysicist learning how different cultures group stars, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: into constellations., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: It is a separate issue whether knowing the arithmetic of Roman numerals, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: might be necessary in the understanding of history. Suppose that some, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: historical theory — some explanation — depended on the specific, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: techniques used by the ancient Romans for multiplication (rather as, for, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: instance, it has been conjectured that their specific plumbing techniques,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: based on lead pipes, which poisoned their drinking water, contributed to the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: decline of the Roman Empire). Then we should have to know what those, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: techniques were if we wanted to understand history, and therefore also if we, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: wanted to understand everything that is understood. But in the event, no, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: current explanation of history draws upon multiplication techniques, so our, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: records of those techniques are mere statements of facts. Everything that is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: understood can be understood without learning those facts. We can always, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: look them up when, for instance, we are deciphering an ancient text that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mentions them., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: In continually drawing a distinction between understanding and ‘mere’, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: knowing, I do not want to understate the importance of recorded, non-, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explanatory information. This is of course essential to everything from the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: reproduction of a micro-organism (which has such information in its DNA, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: molecules) to the most abstract human thinking. So what distinguishes, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: understanding from mere knowing? What is an explanation, as opposed to a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mere statement of fact such as a correct description or prediction? In, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: practice, we usually recognize the difference easily enough. We know when, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: we do not understand something, even if we can accurately describe and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: predict it (for instance, the course of a known disease of unknown origin),, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and we know when an explanation helps us to understand it better. But it is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: hard to give a precise definition of ‘explanation’ or ‘understanding’. Roughly, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: speaking, they are about ‘why’ rather than ‘what’; about the inner workings of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: things; about how things really are, not just how they appear to be; about, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: what must be so, rather than what merely happens to be so; about laws of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: nature rather than rules of thumb. They are also about coherence, elegance, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and simplicity, as opposed to arbitrariness and complexity, though none of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: those things is easy to define either. But in any case, understanding is one, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of the higher functions of the human mind and brain, and a unique one., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Many other physical systems, such as animals’ brains, computers and other, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: machines, can assimilate facts and act upon them. But at present we know, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of nothing that is capable of understanding an explanation — or of wanting, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: one in the first place — other than a human mind. Every discovery of a new, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explanation, and every act of grasping an existing explanation, depends on, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the uniquely human faculty of creative thought., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: One can think of what happened to Roman numerals as a process of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘demotion’ of an explanatory theory to a mere description of facts. Such, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: demotions happen all the time as our knowledge grows. Originally, the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Roman system of numerals did form part of the conceptual and theoretical, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: framework through which the people who used them understood the world., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: But now the understanding that used to be obtained in that way is but a tiny, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: facet of the far deeper understanding embodied in modern mathematical, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theories, and implicitly in modern notations., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: This illustrates another attribute of understanding. It is possible to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: understand something without knowing that one understands it, or even, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: without having specifically heard of it. This may sound paradoxical, but of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: course the whole point of deep, general explanations is that they cover, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: unfamiliar situations as well as familiar ones. If you were a modern, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mathematician encountering Roman numerals for the first time, you might, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: not instantly realize that you already understood them. You would first have, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to learn the facts about what they are, and then think about those facts in the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: light of your existing understanding of mathematics. But once you had done, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that, you would be able to say, in retrospect, ‘Yes, there is nothing new to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: me in the Roman system of numerals, beyond mere facts.’ And that is what it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: means to say that Roman numerals, in their explanatory role, are fully, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: obsolete., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Similarly, when I say that I understand how the curvature of space and time, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: affects the motions of planets, even in other solar systems I may never have, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: heard of, I am not claiming that I can call to mind, without further thought, the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explanation of every detail of the loops and wobbles of any planetary orbit., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: What I mean is that I understand the theory that contains all those, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explanations, and that I could therefore produce any of them in due course,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: given some facts about a particular planet. Having done so, I should be able, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to say in retrospect, ‘Yes, I see nothing in the motion of that planet, other, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: than mere facts, which is not explained by the general theory of relativity.’, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: We understand the fabric of reality only by understanding theories that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explain it. And since they explain more than we are immediately aware of,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: we can understand more than we are immediately aware that we, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: understand., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: I am not saying that when we understand a theory it necessarily follows that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: we understand everything it can explain. With a very deep theory, the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: recognition that it explains a given phenomenon may itself be a significant, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: discovery requiring independent explanation. For example, quasars —, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: extremely bright sources of radiation at the centre of some galaxies — were, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: for many years one of the mysteries of astrophysics. It was once thought, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that new physics would be needed to explain them, but now we believe that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: they are explained by the general theory of relativity and other theories that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: were already known before quasars were discovered. We believe that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: quasars consist of hot matter in the process of falling into black holes, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: (collapsed stars whose gravitational field is so intense that nothing can, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: escape from them). Yet reaching that conclusion has required years of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: research, both observational and theoretical. Now that we believe we have, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: gained a measure of understanding of quasars, we do not think that this, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: understanding is something we already had before. Explaining quasars,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: albeit through existing theories, has given us genuinely new understanding., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Just as it is hard to define what an explanation is, it is hard to define when a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: subsidiary explanation should count as an independent component of what, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: is understood, and when it should be considered as being subsumed in the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: deeper theory. It is hard to define, but not so hard to recognize: as with, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explanations in general, in practice we know a new explanation when we are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: given one. Again, the difference has something to do with creativity., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Explaining the motion of a particular planet, when one already understands, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the general explanation of gravity, is a mechanical task, though it may be a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: very complex one. But using existing theory to account for quasars requires, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: creative thought. Thus, to understand everything that is understood in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: astrophysics today, you would have to know the theory of quasars explicitly., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: But you would not have to know the orbit of any specific planet., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: So, even though our stock of known theories is indeed snowballing, just as, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: our stock of recorded facts is, that still does not necessarily make the whole, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: structure harder to understand than it used to be. For while our specific, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theories are becoming more numerous and more detailed, they are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: continually being ‘demoted’ as the understanding they contain is taken over, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: by deep, general theories. And those theories are becoming fewer, deeper, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and more general. By ‘more general’ I mean that each of them says more,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: about a wider range of situations, than several distinct theories did, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: previously. By ‘deeper’ I mean that each of them explains more — embodies, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: more understanding — than its predecessors did, combined., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Centuries ago, if you had wanted to build a large structure such as a bridge, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: or a cathedral you would have engaged a master builder. He would have, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: had some knowledge of what it takes to give a structure strength and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: stability with the least possible expense and effort. He would not have been, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: able to express much of this knowledge in the language of mathematics and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: physics, as we can today. Instead, he relied mainly on a complex collection, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of intuitions, habits and rules of thumb, which he had learned from his, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: apprentice-master and then perhaps amended through guesswork and long, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: experience. Even so, these intuitions, habits and rules of thumb were in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: effect theories, explicit and inexplicit, and they contained real knowledge of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the subjects we nowadays call engineering and architecture. It was for the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: knowledge in those theories that you would have hired him, pitifully, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: inaccurate though it was compared with what we have today, and of very, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: narrow applicability. When admiring centuries-old structures, people often, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: forget that we see only the surviving ones. The overwhelming majority of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: structures built in medieval and earlier times have collapsed long ago, often, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: soon after they were built. That was especially so for innovative structures. It, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: was taken for granted that innovation risked catastrophe, and builders, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: seldom deviated much from designs and techniques that had been validated, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: by long tradition. Nowadays, in contrast, it is quite rare for any structure —, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: even one that is unlike anything that has ever been built before — to fail, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: because of faulty design. Anything that an ancient master builder could have, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: built, his modern colleagues can build better and with far less human effort., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: They can also build structures which he could hardly have dreamt of, such, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: as skyscrapers and space stations. They can use materials which he had, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: never heard of, such as fibreglass or reinforced concrete, and which he, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: could hardly have used even if he could somehow have been given them, for, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: he had only a scanty and inaccurate understanding of how materials work., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Progress to our current state of knowledge was not achieved by, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: accumulating more theories of the same kind as the master builder knew., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Our knowledge, both explicit and inexplicit, is not only much greater than his, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: but structurally different too. As I have said, the modern theories are fewer,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: more general and deeper. For each situation that the master builder faced, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: while building something in his repertoire — say, when deciding how thick to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: make a load-bearing wall — he had a fairly specific intuition or rule of thumb,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: which, however, could give hopelessly wrong answers if applied to novel, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: situations. Today one deduces such things from a theory that is general, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: enough for it to be applied to walls made of any material, in all situations: on, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the Moon, underwater, or wherever. The reason why it is so general is that it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: is based on quite deep explanations of how materials and structures work., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: To find the proper thickness of a wall that is to be made from an unfamiliar, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: material, one uses the same theory as for any other wall, but starts the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: calculation by assuming different facts — by using different numerical values, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: for the various parameters. One has to look up those facts, such as the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: tensile strength and elasticity of the material, but one needs no additional, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: understanding., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: That is why, despite understanding incomparably more than an ancient, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: master builder did, a modern architect does not require a longer or more, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: arduous training. A typical theory in a modern student’s syllabus may be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: harder to understand than any of the master builder’s rules of thumb; but the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: modern theories are far fewer, and their explanatory power gives them other, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: properties such as beauty, inner logic and connections with other subjects, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: which make them easier to learn. Some of the ancient rules of thumb are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: now known to be erroneous, while others are known to be true, or to be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: good approximations to the truth, and we know why that is so. A few are still, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: in use. But none of them is any longer the source of anyone’s understanding, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of what makes structures stand up., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: I am not, of course, denying that specialization is occurring in many subjects, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: in which knowledge is growing, including architecture. This is not a one-way, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: process, for specializations often disappear too: wheels are no longer, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: designed or made by wheelwrights, nor ploughs by ploughwrights, nor are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: letters written by scribes. It is nevertheless quite evident that the deepening,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: unifying tendency I have been describing is not the only one at work: a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: continual broadening is going on at the same time. That is, new ideas often, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: do more than just supersede, simplify or unify existing ones. They also, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: extend human understanding into areas that were previously not understood, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: at all — or whose very existence was not guessed at. They may open up, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: new opportunities, new problems, new specializations and even new, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: subjects. And when that happens it may give us, at least temporarily, more, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to learn in order to understand it all., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: The science of medicine is perhaps the most frequently cited case of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: increasing specialization seeming to follow inevitably from increasing, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: knowledge, as new cures and better treatments for more diseases are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: discovered. But even in medicine the opposite, unifying tendency is also, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: present, and is becoming stronger. Admittedly, many functions of the body, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: are still poorly understood, and so are the mechanisms of many diseases., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Consequently some areas of medical knowledge still consist mainly of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: collections of recorded facts, together with the skills and intuitions of doctors, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: who have experience of particular diseases and particular treatments, and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: who pass on these skills and intuitions from one generation to the next., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Much of medicine, in other words, is still in the rule-of-thumb era, and when, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: new rules of thumb are discovered there is indeed more incentive for, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: specialization. But as medical and biochemical research comes up with, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: deeper explanations of disease processes (and healthy processes) in the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: body, understanding is also on the increase. More general concepts are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: replacing more specific ones as common, underlying molecular mechanisms, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: are found for dissimilar diseases in different parts of the body. Once a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: disease can be understood as fitting into a general framework, the role of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: specialist diminishes. Instead, physicians coming across an unfamiliar, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: disease or a rare complication can rely increasingly on explanatory theories., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: They can look up such facts as are known. But then they may be able to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: apply a general theory to work out the required treatment, and expect it to be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: effective even if it has never been used before., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Thus the issue of whether it is becoming harder or easier to understand, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: everything that is understood depends on the overall balance between these, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: two opposing effects of the growth of knowledge: the increasing breadth of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: our theories, and their increasing depth. Breadth makes it harder; depth, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: makes it easier. One thesis of this book is that, slowly but surely, depth is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: winning. In other words, the proposition that I refused to believe as a child is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: indeed false, and practically the opposite is true. We are not heading away, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: from a state in which one person could understand everything that is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: understood, but towards it., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: It is not that we shall soon understand everything. That is a completely, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: different issue. I do not believe that we are now, or ever shall be, close to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: understanding everything there is. What I am discussing is the possibility of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: understanding everything that is understood. That depends more on the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: structure of our knowledge than on its content. But of course the structure of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: our knowledge — whether it is expressible in theories that fit together as a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: comprehensible whole — does depend on what the fabric of reality, as a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: whole, is like. If knowledge is to continue its open-ended growth, and if we, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: are nevertheless heading towards a state in which one person could, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: understand everything that is understood, then the depth of our theories, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: must continue to grow fast enough to make this possible. That can happen, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: only if the fabric of reality is itself highly unified, so that more and more of it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: can become understood as our knowledge grows. If that happens, then, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: eventually our theories will become so general, deep and integrated with one, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: another that they will effectively become a single theory of a unified fabric of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: reality. This theory will still not explain every aspect of reality: that is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: unattainable. But it will encompass all known explanations, and will apply to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the whole fabric of reality in so far as it is understood. Whereas all previous, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theories related to particular subjects, this will be a theory of all subjects: a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Theory of Everything., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: It will not, of course, be the last such theory, only the first. In science we take, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: it for granted that even our best theories are bound to be imperfect and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: problematic in some ways, and we expect them to be superseded in due, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: course by deeper, more accurate theories. Such progress is not brought to a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: halt when we discover a universal theory. For example, Newton gave us the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: first universal theory of gravity and a unification of, among other things,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: celestial and terrestrial mechanics. But his theories have been superseded, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: by Einstein’s general theory of relativity which additionally incorporates, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: geometry (formerly regarded as a branch of mathematics) into physics, and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: in so doing provides far deeper explanations as well as being more accurate., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: The first fully universal theory — which I shall call the Theory of Everything, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: — will, like all our theories before and after it, be neither perfectly true nor, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: infinitely deep, and so will eventually be superseded. But it will not be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: superseded through unifications with theories about other subjects, for it will, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: already be a theory of all subjects. In the past, some great advances in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: understanding came about through great unifications. Others came through, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: structural changes in the way we were understanding a particular subject —, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: as when we ceased to think of the Earth as being the centre of the universe., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: After the first Theory of Everything, there will be no more great unifications., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: All subsequent great discoveries will take the form of changes in the way we, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: understand the world as a whole: shifts in our world-view. The attainment of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: a Theory of Everything will be the last great unification, and at the same time, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: it will be the first across-the-board shift to a new world-view. I believe that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: such a unification and shift are now under way. The associated world-view is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the theme of this book. I must stress immediately that I am not referring, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: merely to the ‘theory of everything’ which some particle physicists hope they, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: will soon discover. Their ‘theory of everything’ would be a unified theory of all, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the basic forces known to physics, namely gravity, electromagnetism and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: nuclear forces. It would also describe all the types of subatomic particles that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: exist, their masses, spins, electric charges and other properties, and how, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: they interact. Given a sufficiently precise description of the initial state of any, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: isolated physical system, it would in principle predict the future behaviour of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the system. Where the exact behaviour of a system was intrinsically, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: unpredictable, it would describe all possible behaviours and predict their, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: probabilities. In practice, the initial states of interesting systems often cannot, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: be ascertained very accurately, and in any case the calculation of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: predictions would be too complicated to be carried out in all but the simplest, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: cases. Nevertheless, such a unified theory of particles and forces, together, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: with a specification of the initial state of the universe at the Big Bang (the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: violent explosion with which the universe began), would in principle contain, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: all the information necessary to predict everything that can be predicted, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: (Figure 1.1)., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: But prediction is not explanation. The hoped-for ‘theory of everything’, even, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: if combined with a theory of the initial state, will at best provide only a tiny, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: facet of a real Theory of Everything. It may predict everything (in principle)., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: But it cannot be expected to explain much more than existing theories do,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: except for a few phenomena that are dominated by the nuances of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: subatomic interactions, such as collisions inside particle accelerators, and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the exotic history of particle transmutations in the Big Bang. What motivates, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the use of the term ‘theory of everything’ for such a narrow, albeit, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: fascinating, piece of knowledge? It is, I think, another mistaken view of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: nature of science, held disapprovingly by many critics of science and (alas), Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: approvingly by many scientists, namely that science is essentially, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: reductionist. That is to say, science allegedly explains things reductively —, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: by analysing them into components. For example, the resistance of a wall to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: being penetrated or knocked down is explained by regarding the wall as a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: vast aggregation of interacting molecules. The properties of those molecules, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: are themselves explained in terms of their constituent atoms, and the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: interactions of these atoms with one another, and so on down to the smallest, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: particles and most basic forces. Reductionists think that all scientific, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explanations, and perhaps all sufficiently deep explanations of any kind, take, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that form., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: Figure 1.1. An inadequate conception of the ‘theory of everything’., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text:   , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: The reductionist conception leads naturally to a classification of objects and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theories in a hierarchy, according to how close they are to the ‘lowest-level’, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: predictive theories that are known. In this hierarchy, logic and mathematics, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: form the immovable bedrock on which the edifice of science is built. The, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: foundation stone would be a reductive ‘theory of everything’, a universal, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theory of particles, forces, space and time, together with some theory of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: what the initial state of the universe was. The rest of physics forms the first, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: few storeys. Astrophysics and chemistry are at a higher level, geology even, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: higher, and so on. The edifice branches into many towers of increasingly, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: high-level subjects like biochemistry, biology and genetics. Perched at the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: tottering, stratospheric tops are subjects like the theory of evolution,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: economics, psychology and computer science, which in this picture are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: almost inconceivably derivative. At present, we have only approximations to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: a reductive ‘theory of everything’. These can already predict quite accurate, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: laws of motion for individual subatomic particles. From these laws, present-, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: day computers can calculate the motion of any isolated group of a few, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: interacting particles in some detail, given their initial state. But even the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: smallest speck of matter visible to the naked eye contains trillions of atoms,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: each composed of many subatomic particles, and is continually interacting, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: with the outside world; so it is quite infeasible to predict its behaviour particle, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: by particle. By supplementing the exact laws of motion with various, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: approximation schemes, we can predict some aspects of the gross, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: behaviour of quite large objects — for instance, the temperature at which a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: given chemical compound will melt or boil. Much of basic chemistry has, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: been reduced to physics in this way. But for higher-level sciences the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: reductionist programme is a matter of principle only. No one expects actually, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to deduce many principles of biology, psychology or politics from those of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: physics. The reason why higher-level subjects can be studied at all is that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: under special circumstances the stupendously complex behaviour of vast, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: numbers of particles resolves itself into a measure of simplicity and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: comprehensibility. This is called emergence: high-level simplicity ‘emerges’, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: from low-level complexity. High-level phenomena about which there are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: comprehensible facts that are not simply deducible from lower-level theories, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: are called emergent phenomena. For example, a wall might be strong, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: because its builders feared that their enemies might try to force their way, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: through it. This is a high-level explanation of the wall’s strength, not, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: deducible from (though not incompatible with) the low-level explanation I, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: gave above. ‘Builders’, ‘enemies’, ‘fear’ and ‘trying’ are all emergent, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: phenomena. The purpose of high-level sciences is to enable us to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: understand emergent phenomena, of which the most important are, as we, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: shall see, life, thought and computation., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: By the way, the opposite of reductionism, holism — the idea that the only, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: legitimate explanations are in terms of higher-level systems — is an even, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: greater error than reductionism. What do holists expect us to do? Cease our, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: search for the molecular origin of diseases? Deny that human beings are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: made of subatomic particles? Where reductive explanations exist, they are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: just as desirable as any other explanations. Where whole sciences are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: reducible to lower-level sciences, it is just as incumbent upon us as, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: scientists to find those reductions as it is to discover any other knowledge., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: A reductionist thinks that science is about analysing things into components., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: An instrumentalist thinks that it is about predicting things. To either of them,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the existence of high-level sciences is merely a matter of convenience., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Complexity prevents us from using fundamental physics to make high-level, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: predictions, so instead we guess what those predictions would be if we could, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: make them — emergence gives us a chance of doing that successfully —, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and supposedly that is what the higher-level sciences are about. Thus to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: reductionists and instrumentalists, who disregard both the real structure and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the real purpose of scientific knowledge, the base of the predictive hierarchy, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of physics is by definition the ‘theory of everything’. But to everyone else, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: scientific knowledge consists of explanations, and the structure of scientific, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explanation does not reflect the reductionist hierarchy. There are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explanations at every level of the hierarchy. Many of them are autonomous,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: referring only to concepts at that particular level (for instance, ‘the bear ate, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the honey because it was hungry’). Many involve deductions in the opposite, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: direction to that of reductive explanation. That is, they explain things not by, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: analysing them into smaller, simpler things but by regarding them as, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: components of larger, more complex things — about which we nevertheless, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: have explanatory theories. For example, consider one particular copper, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: atom at the tip of the nose of the statue of Sir Winston Churchill that stands, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: in Parliament Square in London. Let me try to explain why that copper atom, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: is there. It is because Churchill served as prime minister in the House of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Commons nearby; and because his ideas and leadership contributed to the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Allied victory in the Second World War; and because it is customary to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: honour such people by putting up statues of them; and because bronze, a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: traditional material for such statues, contains copper, and so on. Thus we, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explain a low-level physical observation — the presence of a copper atom at, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: a particular location — through extremely high-level theories about emergent, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: phenomena such as ideas, leadership, war and tradition. There is no reason, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: why there should exist, even in principle, any lower-level explanation of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: presence of that copper atom than the one I have just given. Presumably a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: reductive ‘theory of everything’ would in principle make a low-level prediction, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of the probability that such a statue will exist, given the condition of (say) the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: solar system at some earlier date. It would also in principle describe how the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: statue probably got there. But such descriptions and predictions (wildly, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: infeasible, of course) would explain nothing. They would merely describe the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: trajectory that each copper atom followed from the copper mine, through the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: smelter and the sculptor’s studio, and so on. They could also state how, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: those trajectories were influenced by forces exerted by surrounding atoms,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: such as those comprising the miners’ and sculptor’s bodies, and so predict, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the existence and shape of the statue. In fact such a prediction would have, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to refer to atoms all over the planet, engaged in the complex motion we call, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the Second World War, among other things. But even if you had the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: superhuman capacity to follow such lengthy predictions of the copper atom’s, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: being there, you would still not be able to say, ‘Ah yes, now I understand, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: why it is there.’ You would merely know that its arrival there in that way was, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: inevitable (or likely, or whatever), given all the atoms’ initial configurations, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and the laws of physics. If you wanted to understand why, you would still, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: have no option but to take a further step. You would have to inquire into, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: what it was about that configuration of atoms, and those trajectories, that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: gave them the propensity to deposit a copper atom at this location. Pursuing, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: this inquiry would be a creative task, as discovering new explanations, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: always is. You would have to discover that certain atomic configurations, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: support emergent phenomena such as leadership and war, which are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: related to one another by high-level explanatory theories. Only when you, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: knew those theories could you understand fully why that copper atom is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: where it is., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: In the reductionist world-view, the laws governing subatomic particle, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: interactions are of paramount importance, as they are the base of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: hierarchy of all knowledge. But in the real structure of scientific knowledge,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and in the structure of our knowledge generally, such laws have a much, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: more humble role., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: What is that role? It seems to me that none of the candidates for a ‘theory of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: everything’ that has yet been contemplated contains much that is new by, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: way of explanation. Perhaps the most innovative approach from the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explanatory point of view is superstring theory, in which extended objects,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘strings’, rather than point-like particles, are the elementary building blocks of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: matter. But no existing approach offers an entirely new mode of explanation, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: — new in the sense of Einstein’s explanation of gravitational forces in terms, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of curved space and time. In fact, the ‘theory of everything’ is expected to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: inherit virtually its entire explanatory structure — its physical concepts, its, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: language, its mathematical formalism and the form of its explanations —, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: from the existing theories of electromagnetism, nuclear forces and gravity., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Therefore we may look to this underlying structure, which we already know, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: from existing theories, for the contribution of fundamental physics to our, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: overall understanding., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: There are two theories in physics which are considerably deeper than all, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: others. The first is the general theory of relativity, which as I have said is our, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: best theory of space, time and gravity. The second, quantum theory, is even, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: deeper. Between them, these two theories (and not any existing or currently, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: envisaged theory of subatomic particles) provide the detailed explanatory, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and formal framework within which all other theories in modern physics are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: expressed, and they contain overarching physical principles to which all, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: other theories conform. A unification of general relativity and quantum theory, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: — to give a quantum theory of gravity — has been a major quest of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theoretical physicists for several decades, and would have to form part of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: any theory of everything in either the narrow or the broad sense of the term., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: As we shall see in the next chapter, quantum theory, like relativity, provides, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: a revolutionary new mode of explanation of physical reality. The reason why, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: quantum theory is the deeper of the two lies more outside physics than, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: within it, for its ramifications are very wide, extending far beyond physics —, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and even beyond science itself as it is normally conceived. Quantum theory, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: is one of what I shall call the four main strands of which our current, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: understanding of the fabric of reality is composed., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Before I say what the other three strands are, I must mention another way in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: which reductionism misrepresents the structure of scientific knowledge. Not, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: only does it assume that explanation always consists of analysing a system, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: into smaller, simpler systems, it also assumes that all explanation is of later, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: events in terms of earlier events; in other words, that the only way of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explaining something is to state its causes. And this implies that the earlier, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the events in terms of which we explain something, the better the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: explanation, so that ultimately the best explanations of all are in terms of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: initial state of the universe., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: A ‘theory of everything’ which excludes a specification of the initial state of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the universe is not a complete description of physical reality because it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: provides only laws of motion; and laws of motion, by themselves, make only, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: conditional predictions. That is, they never state categorically what happens,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: but only what will happen at one time given what was happening at another, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: time. Only if a complete specification of the initial state is provided can a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: complete description of physical reality in principle be deduced. Current, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: cosmological theories do not provide a complete specification of the initial, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: state, even in principle, but they do say that the universe was initially very, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: small, very hot and very uniform in structure. We also know that it cannot, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: have been perfectly uniform because that would be incompatible, according, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to the theory, with the distribution of galaxies we observe across the sky, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: today. The initial variations in density, ‘lumpiness’, would have been greatly, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: enhanced by gravitational clumping (that is, relatively dense regions would, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: have attracted more matter and become denser), so they need only have, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: been very slight initially. But, slight though they were, they are of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: greatest significance in any reductionist description of reality, because, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: almost everything that we see happening around us, from the distribution of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: stars and galaxies in the sky to the appearance of bronze statues on planet, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Earth, is, from the point of view of fundamental physics, a consequence of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: those variations. If our reductionist description is to cover anything more than, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the grossest features of the observed universe, we need a theory specifying, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: those all-important initial deviations from uniformity., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Let me try to restate this requirement without the reductionist bias. The laws, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of motion for any physical system make only conditional predictions, and are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: therefore compatible with many possible histories of that system. (This issue, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: is independent of the limitations on predictability that are imposed by, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: quantum theory, which I shall discuss in the next chapter.) For instance, the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: laws of motion governing a cannon-ball fired from a gun are compatible with, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: many possible trajectories, one for every possible direction and elevation in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: which the gun could have been pointing when it was fired (Figure 1.2)., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Mathematically, the laws of motion can be expressed as a set of equations, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: called the equations of motion. These have many different solutions, one, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: describing each possible trajectory. To specify which solution describes the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: actual trajectory, we must provide supplementary data — some data about, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: what actually happens. One way of doing that is to specify the initial state, in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: this case the direction in which the gun was pointing. But there are other, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ways too. For example, we could just as well specify the final state — the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: position and direction of motion of the cannon-ball at the moment it lands. Or, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: we could specify the position of the highest point of the trajectory. It does not, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: matter what supplementary data we give, so long as they pick out one, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: particular solution of the equations of motion. The combination of any such, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: supplementary data with the laws of motion amounts to a theory that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: describes everything that happens to the cannon-ball between firing and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: impact., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:   , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Similarly, the laws of motion for physical reality as a whole would have many, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: solutions, each corresponding to a distinct history. To complete the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: description, we should have to specify which history is the one that has, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: actually occurred, by giving enough supplementary data to yield one of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: many solutions of the equations of motion. In simple cosmological models at, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: least, one way of giving such data is to specify the initial state of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: universe. But alternatively we could specify the final state, or the state at any, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: other time; or we could give some information about the initial state, some, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: about the final state, and some about states in between. In general, the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: combination of enough supplementary data of any sort with the laws of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: motion would amount to a complete description, in principle, of physical, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: reality., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: For the cannon-ball, once we have specified, say, the final state it is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: straightforward to calculate the initial state, and vice versa, so there is no, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: practical difference between different methods of specifying the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: supplementary data. But for the universe most such calculations are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: intractable. I have said that we infer the existence of ‘lumpiness’ in the initial, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: conditions from observations of ‘lumpiness’ today. But that is exceptional:, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: most of our knowledge of supplementary data — of what specifically, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: happens — is in the form of high-level theories about emergent phenomena,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and is therefore by definition not practically expressible in the form of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: statements about the initial state. For example, in most solutions of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: equations of motion the initial state of the universe does not have the right, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: properties for life to evolve from it. Therefore our knowledge that life has, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: evolved is a significant piece of the supplementary data. We may never, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: know what, specifically, this restriction implies about the detailed structure of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the Big Bang, but we can draw conclusions from it directly. For example, the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: earliest accurate estimate of the age of the Earth was made on the basis of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the biological theory of evolution, contradicting the best physics of the day., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Only a reductionist prejudice could make us feel that this was somehow a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: less valid form of reasoning, or that in general it is more ‘fundamental’ to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theorize about the initial state than about emergent features of reality., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Even in the domain of fundamental physics, the idea that theories of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: initial state contain our deepest knowledge is a serious misconception. One, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: reason is that it logically excludes the possibility of explaining the initial state, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: itself — why the initial state was what it was — but in fact we have, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explanations of many aspects of the initial state. And more generally, no, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theory of time can possibly explain it in terms of anything ‘earlier’; yet we do, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: have deep explanations, from general relativity and even more from, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: quantum theory, of the nature of time (see Chapter 11)., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Thus the character of many of our descriptions, predictions and explanations, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of reality bear no resemblance to the ‘initial state plus laws of motion’ picture, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that reductionism leads to. There is no reason to regard high-level theories, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: as in any way ‘second-class citizens’. Our theories of subatomic physics,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and even of quantum theory or relativity, are in no way privileged relative to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theories about emergent properties. None of these areas of knowledge can, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: possibly subsume all the others. Each of them has logical implications for the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: others, but not all the implications can be stated, for they are emergent, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: properties of the other theories’ domains. In fact, the very terms ‘high level’, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and ‘low level’ are misnomers. The laws of biology, say, are high-level,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: emergent consequences of the laws of physics. But logically, some of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: laws of physics are then ‘emergent’ consequences of the laws of biology. It, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: could even be that, between them, the laws governing biological and other, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: emergent phenomena would entirely determine the laws of fundamental, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: physics. But in any case, when two theories are logically related, logic does, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: not dictate which of them we ought to regard as determining, wholly or partly,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the other. That depends on the explanatory relationships between the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theories. The truly privileged theories are not the ones referring to any, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: particular scale of size or complexity, nor the ones situated at any particular, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: level of the predictive hierarchy — but the ones that contain the deepest, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explanations. The fabric of reality does not consist only of reductionist, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ingredients like space, time and subatomic particles, but also of life, thought,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: computation and the other things to which those explanations refer. What, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: makes a theory more fundamental, and less derivative, is not its closeness, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to the supposed predictive base of physics, but its closeness to our deepest, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explanatory theories., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Quantum theory is, as I have said, one such theory. But the other three main, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: strands of explanation through which we seek to understand the fabric of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: reality are all ‘high level’ from the point of view of quantum physics. They are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the theory of evolution (primarily the evolution of living organisms),, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: epistemology (the theory of knowledge) and the theory of computation, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: (about computers and what they can and cannot, in principle, compute). As I, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: shall show, such deep and diverse connections have been discovered, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: between the basic principles of these four apparently independent subjects, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that it has become impossible to reach our best understanding of any one of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: them without also understanding the other three. The four of them taken, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: together form a coherent explanatory structure that is so far-reaching, and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: has come to encompass so much of our understanding of the world, that in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: my view it may already properly be called the first real Theory of Everything., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Thus we have arrived at a significant moment in the history of ideas — the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: moment when the scope of our understanding begins to be fully universal., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Up to now, all our understanding has been about some aspect of reality,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: untypical of the whole. In the future it will be about a unified conception of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: reality: all explanations will be understood against the backdrop of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: universality, and every new idea will automatically tend to illuminate not just, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: a particular subject, but, to varying degrees, all subjects. The dividend of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: understanding that we shall eventually reap from this last great unification, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: may far surpass that yielded by any previous one. For we shall see that it is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: not only physics that is being unified and explained here, and not only, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: science, but also potentially the far reaches of philosophy, logic and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: only for conducting crucial experimental tests to discriminate between, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: competing scientific theories that have already passed the test of being good, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explanations. As new theories supersede old ones, our knowledge is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: becoming both broader (as new subjects are created) and deeper (as our, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: winning. Thus we are not heading away from a state in which one person, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: could understand everything that was understood, but towards it. Our, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: order not to complicate the experiment with reflected light, the walls of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: Figure 2.1 does show that the light is brightest near the torch, and gets, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: the reflector would appear ever smaller and then, when it could only be seen, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: as a single point, ever fainter. Or would it? Can light really be spread more, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and more thinly without limit? The answer is no. At a distance of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: approximately ten thousand kilometres from the torch, its light would be too, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: faint for the human eye to detect and the observer would see nothing. That, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: is, a human observer would see nothing; but what about an animal with, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: more sensitive vision? Frogs’ eyes are several times more sensitive than, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: human eyes — just enough to make a significant difference in this, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: experiment. If the observer were a frog, and it kept moving ever farther away, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: from the torch, the moment at which it entirely lost sight of the torch would, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: never come. Instead, the frog would see the torch begin to flicker. The, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: flickers would come at irregular intervals that would become longer as the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: frog moved farther away. But the brightness of the individual flickers would, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: not diminish. At a distance of one hundred million kilometres from the torch,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the frog would see on average only one flicker of light per day, but that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: flicker would be as bright as any that it observed at any other distance., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Frogs cannot tell us what they see. So in real experiments we use, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: photomultipliers (light detectors which are even more sensitive than frogs’, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: eyes), and we thin out the light by passing it through dark filters, rather than, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: by observing it from a hundred million kilometres away. But the principle is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the same, and so is the result: neither apparent darkness nor uniform, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: dimness, but flickering, with the individual flickers equally bright no matter, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: how dark a filter we use. This flickering indicates that there is a limit to how, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: thinly light can be evenly spread. Borrowing the terminology of goldsmiths,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: one might say that light is not infinitely ‘malleable’. Like gold, a small amount, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of light can be evenly spread over a very large area, but eventually if one, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: tries to spread it out further it gets lumpy. Even if gold atoms could somehow, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: be prevented from clumping together, there is a point beyond which they, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: cannot be subdivided without ceasing to be gold. So the only way in which, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: one can make a one-atom-thick gold sheet even thinner is to space the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: atoms farther apart, with empty space between them. When they are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: sufficiently far apart it becomes misleading to think of them as forming a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: continuous sheet. For example, if each gold atom were on average several, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: centimetres from its nearest neighbour, one might pass one’s hand through, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the ‘sheet’ without touching any gold at all. Similarly, there is an ultimate, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: lump or ‘atom’ of light, a photon. Each flicker seen by the frog is caused by a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: photon striking the retina of its eye. What happens when a beam of light gets, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: fainter is not that the photons themselves get fainter, but that they get farther, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: apart, with empty space between them (Figure 2.2). When the beam is very, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: faint it can be misleading to call it a ‘beam’, for it is not continuous. During, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: periods when the frog sees nothing it is not because the light entering its eye, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: is too weak to affect the retina, but because no light has entered its eye at, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: all., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: This property of appearing only in lumps of discrete sizes is called, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: quantization. An individual lump, such as a photon, is called a quantum, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: (plural quanta). Quantum theory gets its name from this property, which it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: attributes to all measurable physical quantities — not just to things like the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: amount of light, or the mass of gold, which are quantized because the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: entities concerned, though apparently continuous, are really made of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: particles. Even for quantities like distance (between two atoms, say), the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: There are many new effects in quantum physics, and on the face of it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: quantization is one of the tamest, as we shall see. Yet in a sense it remains, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the key to all the others, for if everything is quantized, how does any quantity, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: change from one value to another? How does any object get from one place, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to another if there is not a continuous range of intermediate places for it to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: be on the way? I shall explain how in Chapter 9 , but let me set that question, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: aside for the moment and return to the vicinity of the torch, where the beam, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: Is the boundary between the light and the shadow perfectly sharp, or is there, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: a grey area? There is usually a fairly wide grey area, and one reason for this, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: is shown in Figure 2.3. There is a dark region (called the umbra) where light, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: from the filament cannot reach. There is a bright region which can receive, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: light from anywhere on the filament. And because the filament is not a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: geometrical point, but has a certain size, there is also a penumbra between, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the bright and dark regions: a region which can receive light from some parts, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of the filament but not from others. If one observes from within the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: penumbra, one can see only part of the filament and the illumination is less, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: there than in the fully illuminated, bright region., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: However, the size of the filament is not the only reason why real torchlight, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: casts penumbras. The light is affected in all sorts of other ways by the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: reflector behind the bulb, by the glass front of the torch, by various seams, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and imperfections, and so on. So we expect quite a complicated pattern of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: light and shadow from a real torch, just because the torch itself is quite, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: complicated. But the incidental properties of torches are not the subject of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: these experiments. Behind our question about torchlight there is a more, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: fundamental question about light in general: is there, in principle, any limit on, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: how sharp a shadow can be (in other words, on how narrow a penumbra can, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: be)? For instance, if the torch were made of perfectly black (non-reflecting), Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: material, and if one were to use smaller and smaller filaments, could one, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: assumption about light, namely that it travels only in straight lines. From, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: everyday experience we know that it does, for we cannot see round corners., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: But careful experiments show that light does not always travel in straight, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: lines. Under some circumstances it bends., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: This is hard to demonstrate with a torch alone, just because it is difficult to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: make very tiny filaments and very black surfaces. These practical difficulties, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mask the limits that fundamental physics imposes on the sharpness of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: shadows. Fortunately, the bending of light can also be demonstrated in a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: different way. Suppose that the light of a torch passes through two, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: successive small holes in otherwise opaque screens, as shown in Figure, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: 2.4, and that the emerging light falls on a third screen beyond. Our question, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: now is this: if the experiment is repeated with ever smaller holes and with, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ever greater separation between the first and second screens, can one bring, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the umbra — the region of total darkness — ever closer, without limit, to the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: straight line through the centres of the two holes? Can the illuminated region, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: between the second and third screens be confined to an arbitrarily narrow, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: cone? In goldsmiths’ terminology, we are now asking something like ‘how, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: small as a ten-thousandth of a millimetre, in fact even with holes as large as, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: a millimetre or so in diameter, the light begins noticeably to rebel. Instead of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: passing through the holes in straight lines, it refuses to be confined and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: spreads out after each hole. And as it spreads, it ‘frays’. The smaller the hole, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: is, the more the light spreads out from its straight-line path. Intricate patterns, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of light and shadow appear. We no longer see simply a bright region and a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: dark region on the third screen, with a penumbra in between, but instead, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: concentric rings of varying thickness and brightness. There is also colour,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: because white light consists of a mixture of photons of various colours, and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: each colour spreads and frays in a slightly different pattern. Figure 2.5, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: shows a typical pattern that might be formed on the third screen by white, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: light that has passed through holes in the first two screens. Remember,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: matters for our present purposes is that it does bend. This means that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: Figure 2.6 shows, at roughly its actual size, a part of the pattern of shadows, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: cast three metres from a pair of straight, parallel slits in an otherwise opaque, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: barrier. The slits are one-fifth of a millimetre apart, and illuminated by a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: parallel-sided beam of pure red light from a laser on the other side of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: barrier. Why laser light and not torchlight? Only because the precise shape, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of a shadow also depends on the colour of the light in which it is cast; white, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: light, as produced by a torch, contains a mixture of all visible colours, so it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: can cast shadows with multicoloured fringes. Therefore in experiments about, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the precise shapes of shadows we are better off using light of a single, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: colour. We could put a coloured filter (such as a pane of coloured glass) over, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: distinguish on this scale), with sharp edges and with the rest of the screen in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: shadow. But in reality the light bends in such a way as to make many bright, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: second, identical pair of slits in the barrier, interleaved with the existing pair,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: so that we have four slits at intervals of one-tenth of a millimetre? We might, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: expect the pattern to look almost exactly like Figure 2.6. After all, the first, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: pair of slits, by itself, casts the shadows in Figure 2.6, and as I have just, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: said, the second pair, by itself, would cast the same pattern, shifted about a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: tenth of a millimetre to the side — in almost the same place. We even know, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that light beams normally pass through each other unaffected. So the two, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: comparison I have repeated, below it, the illustration of the two-slit pattern, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: (Figure 2.7(b)). Clearly, the four-slit shadow is not a combination of two, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: slightly displaced two-slit shadows, but has a new and more complicated, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: pattern. In this pattern there are places, such as the point marked X, which, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: are dark on the four-slit pattern, but bright on the two-slit pattern. These, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: places were bright when there were two slits in the barrier, but went dark, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: when we cut a second pair of slits for the light to pass through. Opening, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: those slits has interfered with the light that was previously arriving at X., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: So, adding two more light sources darkens the point X; removing them, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: illuminates it again. How? One might imagine two photons heading towards, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: X and bouncing off each other like billiard balls. Either photon alone would, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: have hit X, but the two together interfere with each other so that they both, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: end up elsewhere. I shall show in a moment that this explanation cannot be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: coming through that second pair of slits to prevent the light from the first pair, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: words, the interfering entity is obstructed by anything that obstructs light,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: slits. But you may be inclined to doubt the obvious after the next experiment,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the denouement of the series., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: What should we expect to happen when these experiments are performed, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: with only one photon at a time? For instance, suppose that our torch is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: moved so far away that only one photon per day is falling on the screen., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: What will our frog, observing from the screen, see? If it is true that what, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: interferes with each photon is other photons, then shouldn’t the interference, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: be lessened when the photons are very sparse? Should it not cease, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: altogether when there is only one photon passing through the apparatus at, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: any one time? We might still expect penumbras, since a photon might be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: capable of changing course when passing through a slit (perhaps by striking, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: a glancing blow at the edge). But what we surely could not observe is any, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: place on the screen, such as X, that receives photons when two slits are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: open, but which goes dark when two more are opened., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: Yet that is exactly what we do observe. However sparse the photons are, the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: shadow pattern remains the same. Even when the experiment is done with, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: one photon at a time, none of them is ever observed to arrive at X when all, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: four slits are open. Yet we need only close two slits for the flickering at X to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: resume., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Could it be that the photon splits into fragments which, after passing through, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the slits, change course and recombine? We can rule that possibility out too., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: If, again, we fire one photon through the apparatus, but use four detectors,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: one at each slit, then at most one of them ever registers anything. Since in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: such an experiment we never observe two of the detectors going off at once,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: we can tell that the entities that they detect are not splitting up., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: So, if the photons do not split into fragments, and are not being deflected by, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: other photons, what does deflect them? When a single photon at a time is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: passing through the apparatus, what can be coming through the other slits to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: interfere with it?, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Let us take stock. We have found that when one photon passes through this, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: apparatus,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:   , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: it passes through one of the slits, and then something interferes with it,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: deflecting it in a way that depends on what other slits are open;, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the interfering entities have passed through some of the other slits;, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the interfering entities behave exactly like photons …, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: … except that they cannot be seen., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: I shall now start calling the interfering entities ‘photons’. That is what they, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: are, though for the moment it does appear that photons come in two sorts,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: which I shall temporarily call tangible photons and shadow  photons., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Tangible photons are the ones we can see, or detect with instruments,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: whereas the shadow photons are intangible (invisible) — detectable only, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: indirectly through their interference effects on the tangible photons. (Later,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: we shall see that there is no intrinsic difference between tangible and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: shadow photons: each photon is tangible in one universe and intangible in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: all the other parallel universes — but I anticipate.) What we have inferred so, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: far is only that each tangible photon has an accompanying retinue of shadow, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: photons, and that when a photon passes through one of our four slits, some, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: shadow photons pass through the other three slits. Since different, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: interference patterns appear when we cut slits at other places in the screen,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: provided that they are within the beam, shadow photons must be arriving all, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: over the illuminated part of the screen whenever a tangible photon arrives., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Therefore there are many more shadow photons than tangible ones. How, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: many? Experiments cannot put an upper bound on the number, but they do, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: set a rough lower bound. In a laboratory the largest area that we could, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: conveniently illuminate with a laser might be about a square metre, and the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: smallest manageable size for the holes might be about a thousandth of a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: millimetre. So there are about 10 12  (one trillion) possible hole-locations on, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the screen. Therefore there must be at least a trillion shadow photons, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: accompanying each tangible one., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Thus we have inferred the existence of a seething, prodigiously complicated,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: hidden world of shadow photons. They travel at the speed of light, bounce, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: off mirrors, are refracted by lenses, and are stopped by opaque barriers or, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: filters of the wrong colour. Yet they do not trigger even the most sensitive, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: detectors. The only thing in the universe that a shadow photon can be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: observed to affect is the tangible photon that it accompanies. That is the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: phenomenon of interference. Shadow photons would go entirely unnoticed, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: were it not for this phenomenon and the strange patterns of shadows by, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: which we observe it., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Interference is not a special property of photons alone. Quantum theory, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: predicts, and experiment confirms, that it occurs for every sort of particle. So, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: there must be hosts of shadow neutrons accompanying every tangible, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: neutron, hosts of shadow electrons accompanying every electron, and so, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: on. Each of these shadow particles is detectable only indirectly, through its, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: interference with the motion of its tangible counterpart., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: It follows that reality is a much bigger thing than it seems, and most of it is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: invisible. The objects and events that we and our instruments can directly, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: observe are the merest tip of the iceberg., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Now, tangible particles have a property that entitles us to call them,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: collectively, a universe. This is simply their defining property of being, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: tangible, that is, of interacting with each other, and hence of being directly, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: detectable by instruments and sense organs made of other tangible, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: particles. Because of the phenomenon of interference, they are not wholly, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: partitioned off from the rest of reality (that is, from the shadow particles). If, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: they were, we should never have discovered that there is more to reality, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: than tangible particles. But to a good approximation they do resemble the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: universe that we see around us in everyday life, and the universe referred to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: in classical (pre-quantum) physics., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: For similar reasons, we might think of calling the shadow particles,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: collectively, a parallel universe, for they too are affected by tangible particles, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: only through interference phenomena. But we can do better than that. For it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: turns out that shadow particles are partitioned among themselves in exactly, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the same way as the universe of tangible particles is partitioned from them., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: In other words, they do not form a single, homogeneous parallel universe, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: vastly larger than the tangible one, but rather a huge number of parallel, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: universes, each similar in composition to the tangible one, and each obeying, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the same laws of physics, but differing in that the particles are in different, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: positions in each universe., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: A remark about terminology. The word ‘universe’ has traditionally been used, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to mean ‘the whole of physical reality’. In that sense there can be at most, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: one universe. We could stick to that definition, and say that the entity we, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: have been accustomed to calling ‘the universe’ — namely, all the directly, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: perceptible matter and energy around us, and the surrounding space — is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: not the whole universe after all, but only a small portion of it. Then we should, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: have to invent a new name for that small, tangible portion. But most, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: physicists prefer to carry on using the word ‘universe’ to denote the same, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: entity that it has always denoted, even though that entity now turns out to be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: only a small part of physical reality. A new word, multiverse, has been coined, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to denote physical reality as a whole., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Single-particle interference experiments such as I have been describing, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: show us that the multiverse exists and that it contains many counterparts of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: each particle in the tangible universe. To reach the further conclusion that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: the multiverse is roughly partitioned into parallel universes, we must consider, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: interference phenomena involving more than one tangible particle. The, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: simplest way of doing this is to ask, by way of a ‘thought experiment’, what, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: must be happening at the microscopic level when shadow photons strike an, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: opaque object. They are stopped, of course: we know that because, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: interference ceases when an opaque barrier is placed in the paths of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: shadow photons. But why? What stops them? We can rule out the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: straightforward answer — that they are absorbed, like tangible photons, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: would be, by the tangible atoms in the barrier. For one thing, we know that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: shadow photons do not interact with tangible atoms. For another, we can, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: verify by measuring the atoms in the barrier (or more precisely, by replacing, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the barrier by a detector) that they neither absorb energy nor change their, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: state in any way unless they are struck by tangible photons. Shadow, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: photons have no effect., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: To put that another way, shadow photons and tangible photons are affected, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: in identical ways when they reach a given barrier, but the barrier itself is not, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: identically affected by the two types of photon. In fact, as far as we can tell, it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: is not affected by shadow photons at all. That is indeed the defining property, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of shadow photons, for if any material were observably affected by them,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that material could be used as a shadow-photon detector and the entire, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: phenomenon of shadows and interference would not be as I have described, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: it. , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Hence there is some sort of shadow barrier at the same location as the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: tangible barrier. It takes no great leap of imagination to conclude that this, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: shadow barrier is made up of the shadow atoms that we already know must, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: be present as counterparts of the tangible atoms in the barrier. There are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: very many of them present for each tangible atom. Indeed, the total density, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of shadow atoms in even the lightest fog would be more than sufficient to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: stop a tank, let alone a photon, if they could all affect it. Since we find that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: partially transparent barriers have the same degree of transparency for, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: shadow photons as for tangible ones, it follows that not all the shadow atoms, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: in the path of a particular shadow photon can be involved in blocking its, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: passage. Each shadow photon encounters much the same sort of barrier as, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: its tangible counterpart does, a barrier consisting of only a tiny proportion of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: all the shadow atoms that are present., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: For the same reason, each shadow atom in the barrier can be interacting, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: with only a small proportion of the other shadow atoms in its vicinity, and the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ones it does interact with form a barrier much like the tangible one. And so, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: on. All matter, and all physical processes, have this structure. If the tangible, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: barrier is the frog’s retina, then there must be many shadow retinas, each, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: capable of stopping only one of the shadow-counterparts of each photon., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Each shadow retina only interacts strongly with the corresponding shadow, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: photons, and with the corresponding shadow frog, and so on. In other words,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: particles are grouped into parallel universes. They are ‘parallel’ in the sense, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that within each universe particles interact with each other just as they do in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the tangible universe, but each universe affects the others only weakly,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: through interference phenomena., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Thus we have reached the conclusion of the chain of reasoning that begins, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: with strangely shaped shadows and ends with parallel universes. Each step, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: takes the form of noting that the behaviour of objects that we observe can be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: explained only if there are unobserved objects present, and if those, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: unobserved objects have certain properties. The heart of the argument is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that single-particle interference phenomena unequivocally rule out the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: possibility that the tangible universe around us is all that exists. There is no, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: disputing the fact that such interference phenomena occur. Yet the existence, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of the multiverse is still a minority view among physicists. Why?, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: The answer, I regret to say, does not reflect well upon the majority. I shall, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: have more to say about this in Chapter 13, but for the moment let me point, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: out that the arguments I have presented in this chapter are compelling only, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to those who seek explanations. Those who are satisfied with mere, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: prediction, and who have no strong desire to understand how the predicted, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: outcomes of experiments come about, may if they wish simply deny the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: existence of anything other than what I have been calling ‘tangible’ entities., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Some people, such as instrumentalists and positivists, take this line as a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: matter of philosophical principle. I have already said what I think of such, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: principles, and why. Other people just don’t want to think about it. After all, it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: is such a large conclusion, and such a disturbing one on first hearing. But I, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: think that those people are making a mistake. As I hope to persuade readers, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: who bear with me, understanding the multiverse is a precondition for, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: understanding reality as best we can. Nor is this said in a spirit of grim, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: determination to seek the truth no matter how unpalatable it may be (though, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: I hope I would take that attitude if it came to it). It is, on the contrary,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: because the resulting world-view is so much more integrated, and makes, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: more sense in so many ways, than any previous world-view, and certainly, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: more than the cynical pragmatism which too often nowadays serves as a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: surrogate for a world-view among scientists., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘Why can’t we just say,’ some pragmatic physicists ask, ‘that photons behave, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: as if they were interacting with invisible entities? Why can we not leave it at, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that? Why do we have to go on to take a position about whether those, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: invisible entities are really there?’ A more exotic variant of what is essentially, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the same idea is the following. ‘A tangible photon is real; a shadow photon is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: merely a way in which the real photon could possibly have behaved, but did, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: not. Thus quantum theory is about the interaction of the real with the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: possible.’ This, at least, sounds suitably profound. But unfortunately the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: people who take either of these views — including some eminent scientists, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: who ought to know better — invariably lapse into mumbo-jumbo at that point., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: So let us keep cool heads. The key fact is that a real, tangible photon, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: behaves differently according to what paths are open, elsewhere in the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: apparatus, for something to travel along and eventually intercept the tangible, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: photon. Something does travel along those paths, and to refuse to call it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘real’ is merely to play with words. ‘The possible’ cannot interact with the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: real: non-existent entities cannot deflect real ones from their paths. If a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: photon is deflected, it must have been deflected by something, and I have, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: called that thing a ‘shadow photon’. Giving it a name does not make it real,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: but it cannot be true that an actual event, such as the arrival and detection of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: a tangible photon, is caused by an imaginary event such as what that photon, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘could have done’ but did not do. It is only what really happens that can, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: cause other things really to happen. If the complex motions of the shadow, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: photons in an interference experiment were mere possibilities that did not in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: fact take place, then the interference phenomena we see would not, in fact,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: take place., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: The reason why interference effects are usually so weak and hard to detect, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: can be found in the quantum-mechanical laws that govern them. Two, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: particular implications of those laws are relevant. First, every subatomic, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: particle has counterparts in other universes, and is interfered with only by, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: those counterparts. It is not directly affected by any other particles in those, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: universes. Therefore interference is observed only in special situations, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: where the paths of a particle and its shadow counterparts separate and then, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: reconverge (as when a photon and shadow photon are heading towards the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: same point on the screen). Even the timing must be right: if one of the two, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: paths involves a delay, the interference is reduced or prevented. Second,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the detection of interference between any two universes requires an, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: interaction to take place between all the particles whose positions and other, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: attributes are not identical in the two universes. In practice this means that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: interference is strong enough to be detected only between universes that are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: very alike. For example, in all the experiments I have described, the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: interfering universes differ only in the position of one photon. If a photon, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: affects other particles in its travels, and in particular if it is observed, then, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: those particles or the observer will also become differentiated in different, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: universes. If so, subsequent interference involving that photon will be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: undetectable in practice because the requisite interaction between all the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: affected particles is too complicated to arrange. I must mention here that the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: standard phrase for describing this fact, namely ‘observation destroys, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: interference’, is very misleading in three ways. First, it suggests some sort of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: psychokinetic effect of the conscious ‘observer’ on basic physical, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: phenomena, though there is no such effect. Second, the interference is not, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘destroyed’: it is just (much!) harder to observe because doing so involves, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: controlling the precise behaviour of many more particles. And third, it is not, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: just ‘observation’, but any effect of the photon on its surroundings that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: depends on which path the photon has taken, that does this. For the benefit, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of readers who may have seen other accounts of quantum physics, I must, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: briefly make contact between the argument I have given in this chapter and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the way the subject is usually presented. Perhaps because the debate, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: began among theoretical physicists, the traditional starting-point has been, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: quantum theory itself. One states the theory as carefully as possible, and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: then one tries to understand what it tells us about reality. That is the only, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: possible approach if one wants to understand the finer details of quantum, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: phenomena. But as regards the issue of whether reality consists of one, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: universe or many, it is an unnecessarily complicated approach. That is why I, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: have not followed it in this chapter. I have not even stated any of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: postulates of quantum theory — I have merely described some physical, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: phenomena and drawn inescapable conclusions. But if one does start from, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theory, there are two things that everyone agrees on. The first is that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: quantum theory is unrivalled in its ability to predict the outcomes of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: experiments, even if one blindly uses its equations without worrying much, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: about what they mean. The second is that quantum theory tells us, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: something new and bizarre about the nature of reality. The dispute is only, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: about what exactly this is. The physicist Hugh Everett was the first to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: It seems to me that this question, and therefore the whole prevailing tone of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the debate on this issue, is wrong-headed. Admittedly, it is right and proper, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: for theoretical physicists such as myself to devote a great deal of effort to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: trying to understand the formal structure of quantum theory, but not at the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: expense of losing sight of our primary objective, which is to understand, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: reality. Even if the predictions of quantum theory could, somehow, be made, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: without referring to more than one universe, individual photons would still, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: cast shadows in the way I have described. Without knowing anything of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: quantum theory, one can see that those shadows could not be the result of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: any single history of the photon as it travels from the torch to the observer’s, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: eye. They are incompatible with any explanation in terms of only the photons, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that we see. Or in terms of only the barrier that we see. Or in terms of only, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the universe that we see. Therefore, if the best theory available to physics, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: did not refer to parallel universes, it would merely mean that we needed a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: better theory, one that did refer to parallel universes, in order to explain what, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: we see., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: So, does accepting the predictions of quantum theory force us to accept the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: existence of parallel universes? Not in itself. We can always reinterpret any, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theory along instrumentalist lines so that it does not force us to accept, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: anything about reality. But that is beside the point. As I have just said, we do, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: not need deep theories to tell us that parallel universes exist — single-, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: particle interference phenomena tell us that. What we need deep theories for, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: is to explain and predict such phenomena: to tell us what the other universes, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: are like, what laws they obey, how they affect one another, and how all this, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: fits in with the theoretical foundations of other subjects. That is what, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: quantum theory does. The quantum theory of parallel universes is not the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: problem, it is the solution. It is not some troublesome, optional interpretation, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: emerging from arcane theoretical considerations. It is the explanation — the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: only one that is tenable — of a remarkable and counter-intuitive reality., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: So far, I have been using temporary terminology which suggests that one of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the many parallel universes differs from the others by being ‘tangible’. It is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: time to sever that last link with the classical, single-universe conception of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: reality. Let us go back to our frog. We have seen that the story of the frog, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that stares at the distant torch for days at a time, waiting for the flicker that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: comes on average once a day, is not the whole story, because there must, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: also be shadow frogs, in shadow universes that co-exist with the tangible, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: one, also waiting for photons. Suppose that our frog is trained to jump when, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: it sees a flicker. At the beginning of the experiment, the tangible frog will, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: have a large set of shadow counterparts, all initially alike. But shortly, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: afterwards they will no longer all be alike. Any particular one of them is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: unlikely to see a photon immediately. But what is a rare event in any one, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: universe is a common event in the multiverse as a whole. At any instant,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: somewhere in the multiverse, there are a few universes in which one of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: photons is currently striking the retina of the frog in that universe. And that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: frog jumps., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: Why exactly does it jump? Because within its universe it obeys the same, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: laws of physics as tangible frogs do, and its shadow retina has been struck, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: by a shadow photon belonging to that universe. One of the light-sensitive, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: shadow molecules in that shadow retina has responded by undergoing, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: complex chemical changes, to which the shadow frog’s optic nerve has in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: turn responded. It has transmitted a message to the shadow frog’s brain,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and the frog has consequently experienced the sensation of seeing a flicker., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Or should I say ‘the shadow sensation of seeing a flicker’? Surely not. If, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘shadow’ observers, be they frogs or people, are real, then their sensations, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: must be real too. When they observe what we might call a shadow object,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: they observe that it is tangible. They observe this by the same means, and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: according to the same definition, as we apply when we say that the universe, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: we observe is ‘tangible’. Tangibility is relative to a given observer. So, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: objectively there are not two kinds of photon, tangible and shadow, nor two, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: kinds of frog, nor two kinds of universe, one tangible and the rest shadow., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: There is nothing in the description I have given of the formation of shadows,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: or any of the related phenomena, that distinguishes between the ‘tangible’, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and the ‘shadow’ objects, apart from the mere assertion that one of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: copies is ‘tangible’. When I introduced tangible and shadow photons I, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: apparently distinguished them by saying that we can see the former, but not, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the latter. But who are ‘we’? While I was writing that, hosts of shadow Davids, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: were writing it too. They too drew a distinction between tangible and shadow, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: photons; but the photons they called ‘shadow’ include the ones I called, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘tangible’, and the photons they called ‘tangible’ are among those I called, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: In interference experiments there can be places in a shadow-pattern that go, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: dark when new openings are made in the barrier casting the shadow. This, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: remains true even when the experiment is performed with individual, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: particles. A chain of reasoning based on this fact rules out the possibility that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: fact that contemplating a few patterns of light and shadow can force us to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: revise so radically our conception of the structure of reality. The argument I, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: have outlined in the previous chapter is, notwithstanding its controversial, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: conclusion, a typical piece of scientific reasoning. It is worth reflecting on the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: character of this reasoning, which is itself a natural phenomenon at least as, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: surprising and full of ramifications as the physics of shadows., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: To those who would prefer reality to have a more prosaic structure, it may, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: seem somehow out of proportion — unfair, even — that such momentous, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: consequences can flow from the fact that a tiny spot of light on a screen, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: should be here rather than there. Yet they do, and this is by no means the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: first time in the history of science that such a thing has happened. In this, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: respect the discovery of other universes is quite reminiscent of the discovery, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of other planets by early astronomers. Before we sent space probes to the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Moon and planets, all our information about planets came from spots of light, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: (or other radiation) being observed in one place rather than another., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Consider how the original, defining fact about planets — the fact that they, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: are not stars — was discovered. Watching the night sky for a few hours, one, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: sees that the stars appear to revolve about a particular point in the sky. They, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: revolve rigidly, holding fixed positions relative to one another. The traditional, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explanation was that the night sky was a huge ‘celestial sphere’ revolving, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: around the fixed Earth, and that the stars were either holes in the sphere or, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: glowing embedded crystals. However, among the thousands of points of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: light in the sky visible to the naked eye, there are a handful of the brightest, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: which, over longer periods, do not move as if they were fixed on a celestial, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: sphere. They wander about the sky in more complex motions. They are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: called ‘planets’, from the Greek word meaning ‘wanderer’. Their wandering, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: was a sign that the celestial-sphere explanation was inadequate., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Successive explanations of the motions of planets have played an important, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: role in the history of science. Copernicus’s heliocentric theory placed the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: planets and the Earth in circular orbits round the Sun. Kepler discovered that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the orbits are ellipses rather than circles. Newton explained the ellipses, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: through his inverse-square law of gravitational forces, and his theory was, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: later used to predict that the mutual gravitational attraction of planets would, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: cause small deviations from elliptical orbits. The observation of such, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: deviations led to the discovery in 1846 of a new planet, Neptune, one of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: many discoveries that spectacularly corroborated Newton’s theory., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Nevertheless, a few decades later Einstein’s general theory of relativity gave, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: us a fundamentally different explanation of gravity, in terms of curved space, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and time, and thereby predicted slightly different motions again. For, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: instance, it correctly predicted that every year the planet Mercury would drift, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: by about one ten-thousandth of a degree away from where Newton’s theory, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: said it should be. It also implied that starlight passing close to the Sun would, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: be deflected twice as much by gravity as Newton’s theory would predict. The, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: observation of this deflection by Arthur Eddington in 1919 is often deemed to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mark the moment at which the Newtonian world-view ceased to be rationally, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: tenable. (Ironically, modern reappraisals of the accuracy of Eddington’s, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: experiment suggest that this may have been premature.) The experiment,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: which has since been repeated with great accuracy, involved measuring the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: positions of spots (the images of stars close to the limb of the Sun during an, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: eclipse) on a photographic plate., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: As astronomical predictions became more accurate, the differences between, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: what successive theories predicted about the appearance of the night sky, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: diminished. Ever more powerful telescopes and measuring instruments have, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: had to be constructed to detect the differences. However, the explanations, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: underlying these predictions have not been converging. On the contrary, as I, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: have just outlined, there has been a succession of revolutionary changes., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Thus observations of ever smaller physical effects have been forcing ever, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: greater changes in our world-view. It may therefore seem that we are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: inferring ever grander conclusions from ever scantier evidence. What, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: justifies these inferences? Can we be sure that just because a star appeared, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: millimetrically displaced on Eddington’s photographic plate, space and time, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: must be curved; or that because a photodetector at a certain position does, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: not register a ‘hit’ in weak light, there must be parallel universes?, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Indeed, what I have just said understates both the fragility and the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: indirectness of all experimental evidence. For we do not directly perceive the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: stars, spots on photographic plates, or any other external objects or events., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: We see things only when images of them appear on our retinas, and we do, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: not perceive even those images until they have given rise to electrical, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: impulses in our nerves, and those impulses have been received and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: interpreted by our brains. Thus the physical evidence that directly sways us,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and causes us to adopt one theory or world-view rather than another, is less, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: than millimetric: it is measured in thousandths of a millimetre (the separation, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of nerve fibres in the optic nerve), and in hundredths of a volt (the change in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: electric potential in our nerves that makes the difference between our, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: perceiving one thing and perceiving another)., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: However, we do not accord equal significance to all our sensory, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: impressions. In scientific experiments we go to great lengths to bring to our, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: perceptions those aspects of external reality that we think might help us to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: distinguish between rival theories we are considering. Before we even make, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: an observation, we decide carefully where and when we should look, and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: what we should look for. Often we use complex, specially constructed, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: instruments, such as telescopes and photomultipliers. Yet however, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: sophisticated the instruments we use, and however substantial the external, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: causes to which we attribute their readings, we perceive those readings, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: exclusively through our own sense organs. There is no getting away from the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: fact that we human beings are small creatures with only a few inaccurate,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: incomplete channels through which we receive all information from outside, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ourselves. We interpret this information as evidence of a large and complex, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: external universe (or multiverse). But when we are weighing up this, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: evidence, we are literally contemplating nothing more than patterns of weak, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: electric current trickling through our own brains., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: What justifies the inferences we draw from these patterns? It is certainly not, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: a matter of logical deduction. There is no way of proving from these or from, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: any other observations that the external universe, or multiverse, exists at all,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: let alone that the electric currents received by our brains stand in any, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: particular relationship to it. Anything or everything that we perceive might be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: an illusion or a dream. Illusions and dreams are, after all, common., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Solipsism, the theory that only one mind exists and that what appears to be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: external reality is only a dream taking place in that mind, cannot be logically, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: disproved. Reality might consist of one person, presumably you, dreaming a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: lifetime’s experiences. Or it might consist of just you and me. Or just the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: planet Earth and its inhabitants. And if we dreamed evidence — any, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: evidence — of the existence of other people, or other planets, or other, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: universes, that would prove nothing about how many of those things there, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: really are., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Since solipsism, and an infinity of related theories, are logically consistent, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: with your perceiving any possible observational evidence, it follows that you, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: can logically deduce nothing about reality from observational evidence. How,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: then, could I say that the observed behaviour of shadows ‘rules out’ the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theory that there is only one universe, or that eclipse observations make the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Newtonian world-view ‘rationally untenable’? How can that be so? If ‘ruling, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: out’ does not mean ‘disproving’, what does it mean? Why should we feel, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: compelled to change our world-view, or indeed any opinion at all, on account, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of something being ‘ruled out’ in that sense? This critique seems to cast, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: doubt on the whole of science — on any reasoning about external reality that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: appeals to observational evidence. If scientific reasoning does not amount to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: Why should we accept its conclusions?, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: This is known as the ‘problem of induction’. The name derives from what, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: was, for most of the history of science, the prevailing theory of how science, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: works. The theory was that there exists, short of mathematical proof, a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: lesser but still worthy form of justification called induction. Induction was, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: contrasted, on the one hand, with the supposedly perfect justification, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: provided by deduction, and on the other hand with supposedly weaker, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: philosophical or intuitive forms of reasoning that do not even have, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: observational evidence to back them up. In the inductivist theory of scientific, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: knowledge, observations play two roles: first, in the discovery of scientific, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theories, and second, in their justification. A theory is supposed to be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: discovered by ‘extrapolating’ or ‘generalizing’ the results of observations., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Then, if large numbers of observations conform to the theory, and none, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: deviates from it, the theory is supposed to be justified — made more, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: believable, probable or reliable. The scheme is illustrated in Figure 3.1., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: The inductivist analysis of my discussion of shadows would therefore go, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: something like this: ‘We make a series of observations of shadows, and see, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: interference phenomena (stage 1). The results conform to what would be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: expected if there existed parallel universes which affect one another in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: certain ways. But at first no one notices this. Eventually (stage 2) someone, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: forms the generalization that interference will always be observed under the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: given circumstances, and thereby induces the theory that parallel universes, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: are responsible. With every further observation of interference (stage 3) we, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: become a little more convinced of that theory. After a sufficiently long, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: sequence of such observations, and provided that none of them ever, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: contradicts the theory, we conclude (stage 4) that the theory is true., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: It is hard to know where to begin in criticizing the inductivist conception of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: science — it is so profoundly false in so many different ways. Perhaps the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: worst flaw, from my point of view, is the sheer non sequitur that a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: generalized prediction is tantamount to a new theory. Like all scientific, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theories of any depth, the theory that there are parallel universes simply, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: does not have the form of a generalization from the observations. Did we, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: observe first one universe, then a second and a third, and then induce that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: there are trillions of them? Was the generalization that planets will ‘wander’, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: round the sky in one pattern rather than another, equivalent to the theory, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that planets are worlds, in orbit round the Sun, and that the Earth is one of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: them? It is also not true that repeating our observations is the way in which, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: we become convinced of scientific theories. As I have said, theories are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explanations, not merely predictions. If one does not accept a proposed, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explanation of a set of observations, making the observations over and over, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: again is seldom the remedy. Still less can it help us to create a satisfactory, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: Furthermore, even mere predictions can never be justified by observational, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: evidence, as Bertrand Russell illustrated in his story of the chicken. (To, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: avoid any possible misunderstanding, let me stress that this was a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: metaphorical, anthropomorphic chicken, representing a human being trying, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to understand the regularities of the universe.) The chicken noticed that the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: farmer came every day to feed it. It predicted that the farmer would continue, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to bring food every day. Inductivists think that the chicken had ‘extrapolated’, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: its observations into a theory, and that each feeding time added justification, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to that theory. Then one day the farmer came and wrung the chicken’s neck., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: The disappointment experienced by Russell’s chicken has also been, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: experienced by trillions of other chickens. This inductively justifies the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: conclusion that induction cannot justify any conclusions!, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: However, this line of criticism lets inductivism off far too lightly. It does, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: illustrate the fact that repeated observations cannot justify theories, but in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: doing so it entirely misses (or rather, accepts) a more basic misconception:, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: namely, that the inductive extrapolation of observations to form new theories, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: is even possible. In fact, it is impossible to extrapolate observations unless, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: one has already placed them within an explanatory framework. For example,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: in order to ‘induce’ its false prediction, Russell’s chicken must first have had, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: in mind a false explanation of the farmer’s behaviour. Perhaps it guessed, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that the farmer harboured benevolent feelings towards chickens. Had it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: guessed a different explanation — that the farmer was trying to fatten the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: chickens up for slaughter, for instance — it would have ‘extrapolated’ the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: behaviour differently. Suppose that one day the farmer starts bringing the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: chickens more food than usual. How one extrapolates this new set of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: observations to predict the farmer’s future behaviour depends entirely on, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: how one explains it. According to the benevolent-farmer theory, it is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: evidence that the farmer’s benevolence towards chickens has increased,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and that therefore the chickens have even less to worry about than before., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: But according to the fattening-up theory, the behaviour is ominous — it is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: evidence that slaughter is imminent., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: The fact that the same observational evidence can be ‘extrapolated’ to give, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: two diametrically opposite predictions according to which explanation one, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: adopts, and cannot justify either of them, is not some accidental limitation of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the farmyard environment: it is true of all observational evidence under all, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: circumstances. Observations could not possibly play either of the roles, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: assigned to them in the inductivist scheme, even in respect of mere, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: predictions, let alone genuine explanatory theories. Admittedly, inductivism is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: based on the common-sense theory of the growth of knowledge — that we, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: learn from experience — and historically it was associated with the liberation, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of science from dogma and tyranny. But if we want to understand the true, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: nature of knowledge, and its place in the fabric of reality, we must face up to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the fact that inductivism is false, root and branch. No scientific reasoning,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and indeed no successful reasoning of any kind, has ever fitted the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: inductivist description., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: What, then, is the pattern of scientific reasoning and discovery? We have, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: seen that inductivism and all other prediction-centred theories of knowledge, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: are based on a misconception. What we need is an explanation-centred, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theory of knowledge: a theory of how explanations come into being and how, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: they are justified; a theory of how, why and when we should allow our, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: perceptions to change our world-view. Once we have such a theory, we, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: need no separate theory of predictions. For, given an explanation of some, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: observable phenomenon, it is no mystery how one obtains predictions. And, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: if one has justified an explanation, then any predictions derived from that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explanation are automatically justified too., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Fortunately, the prevailing theory of scientific knowledge, which in its modern, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: form is due largely to the philosopher Karl Popper (and which is one of my, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: four ‘main strands’ of explanation of the fabric of reality), can indeed be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: regarded as a theory of explanations in this sense. It regards science as a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: problem-solving process. Inductivism regards the catalogue of our past, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: observations as a sort of skeletal theory, supposing that science is all about, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: filling in the gaps in that theory by interpolation and extrapolation. Problem-, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: solving does begin with an inadequate theory — but not with the notional, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘theory’ consisting of past observations. It begins with our best existing, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theories. When some of those theories seem inadequate to us, and we want, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: new ones, that is what constitutes a problem. Thus, contrary to the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: inductivist scheme shown in Figure 3.1, scientific discovery need not begin, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: with observational evidence. But it does always begin with a problem. By a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘problem’ I do not necessarily mean a practical emergency, or a source of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: anxiety. I just mean a set of ideas that seems inadequate and worth trying to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: improve. The existing explanation may seem too glib, or too laboured; it may, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: seem unnecessarily narrow, or unrealistically ambitious. One may glimpse a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: possible unification with other ideas. Or a satisfactory explanation in one, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: field may appear to be irreconcilable with an equally satisfactory explanation, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: in another. Or it may be that there have been some surprising observations, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: — such as the wandering of planets — which existing theories did not, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: predict and cannot explain., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: This last type of problem resembles stage 1 of the inductivist scheme, but, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: only superficially. For an unexpected observation never initiates a scientific, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: discovery unless the pre-existing theories already contain the seeds of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: problem. For example, clouds wander even more than planets do. This, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: unpredictable wandering was presumably familiar long before planets were, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: discovered. Moreover, predicting the weather would always have been, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: valuable to farmers, seafarers and soldiers, so there would always have, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: been an incentive to theorize about how clouds move. Yet it was not, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: meteorology that blazed the trail for modern science, but astronomy., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Observational evidence about meteorology was far more readily available, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: than in astronomy, but no one paid much attention to it, and no one induced, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: any theories from it about cold fronts or anticyclones. The history of science, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: was not crowded with disputes, dogmas, heresies, speculations and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: elaborate theories about the nature of clouds and their motion. Why?, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Because under the established explanatory structure for weather, it was, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: perfectly comprehensible that cloud motion should be unpredictable., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Common sense suggests that clouds move with the wind. When they drift in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: other directions, it is reasonable to surmise that the wind can be different at, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: different altitudes, and is rather unpredictable, and so it is easy to conclude, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that there is no more to be explained. Some people, no doubt, took this view, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: about planets, and assumed that they were just glowing objects on the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: celestial sphere, blown about by high-altitude winds, or perhaps moved by, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: angels, and that there was no more to be explained. But others were not, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: satisfied with that, and guessed that there were deeper explanations behind, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the wandering of planets. So they searched for such explanations, and found, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: them. At various times in the history of astronomy there appeared to be a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mass of unexplained observational evidence; at other times only a scintilla,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: or none at all. But always, if people had chosen what to theorize about, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: according to the cumulative number of observations of particular, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: phenomena, they would have chosen clouds rather than planets. Yet they, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: chose planets, and for diverse reasons. Some reasons depended on, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: preconceptions about how cosmology ought to be, or on arguments, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: advanced by ancient philosophers, or on mystical numerology. Some were, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: based on the physics of the day, others on mathematics or geometry. Some, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: have turned out to have objective merit, others not. But every one of them, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: amounted to this: it seemed to someone that the existing explanations could, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and should be improved upon., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: One solves a problem by finding new or amended theories, containing, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explanations which do not have the deficiencies, but do retain the merits, of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: existing explanations (Figure 3.2). Thus, after a problem presents itself, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: (stage 1), the next stage always involves conjecture: proposing new, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theories, or modifying or reinterpreting old ones, in the hope of solving the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: problem (stage 2). The conjectures are then criticized which, if the criticism, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: is rational, entails examining and comparing them to see which offers the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: best explanations, according to the criteria inherent in the problem (stage 3)., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: When a conjectured theory fails to survive criticism — that is, when it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: appears to offer worse explanations than other theories do — it is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: abandoned. If we find ourselves abandoning one of our originally held, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theories in favour of one of the newly proposed ones (stage 4), we, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: tentatively deem our problem-solving enterprise to have made progress. I, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: say ‘tentatively’, because subsequent problem-solving will probably involve, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: altering or replacing even these new, apparently satisfactory theories, and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: sometimes even resurrecting some of the apparently unsatisfactory ones., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Thus the solution, however good, is not the end of the story: it is a starting-, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: point for the next problem-solving process (stage 5). This illustrates another, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of the misconceptions behind inductivism. In science the object of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: exercise is not to find a theory that will, or is likely to, be deemed true for, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ever; it is to find the best theory available now, and if possible to improve on, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: all available theories. A scientific argument is intended to persuade us that a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: given explanation is the best one available. It does not and could not say, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: anything about how that explanation will fare when, in the future, it is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: subjected to new types of criticism and compared with explanations that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: have yet to be invented. A good explanation may make good predictions, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: about the future, but the one thing that no explanation can even begin to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: predict is the content or quality of its own future rivals., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: subject-matter or techniques of rational criticism that are involved. Scientific, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: problem-solving always includes a particular method of rational criticism,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: namely experimental testing. Where two or more rival theories make, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: conflicting predictions about the outcome of an experiment, the experiment, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: is performed and the theory or theories that made false predictions are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: abandoned. The very construction of scientific conjectures is focused on, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: finding explanations that have experimentally testable predictions. Ideally we, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: are always seeking crucial experimental tests — experiments whose, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: outcomes, whatever they are, will falsify one or more of the contending, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theories. This process is illustrated in Figure 3.3. Whether or not, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: observations were involved in the instigating problem (stage 1), and whether, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: or not (in stage 2) the contending theories were specifically designed to be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: tested experimentally, it is in this critical phase of scientific discovery (stage, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: 3) that experimental tests play their decisive and characteristic role. That role, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: is to render some of the contending theories unsatisfactory by revealing that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: their explanations lead to false predictions. Here I must mention an, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: asymmetry which is important in the philosophy and methodology of science:, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the asymmetry between experimental refutation and experimental, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: confirmation. Whereas an incorrect prediction automatically renders the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: underlying explanation unsatisfactory, a correct prediction says nothing at all, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: about the underlying explanation. Shoddy explanations that yield correct, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: predictions are two a penny, as UFO enthusiasts, conspiracy-theorists and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: pseudo-scientists of every variety should (but never do) bear in mind., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: If a theory about observable events is untestable — that is, if no possible, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: observation would rule it out — then it cannot by itself explain why those, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: events happen in the way they are observed to and not in some other way., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: For example, the ‘angel’ theory of planetary motion is untestable because no, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: matter how planets moved, that motion could be attributed to angels;, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: therefore the angel theory cannot explain the particular motions that we see,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: unless it is supplemented by an independent theory of how angels move., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: That is why there is a methodological rule in science which says that once, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: an experimentally testable theory has passed the appropriate tests, any less, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: testable rival theories about the same phenomena are summarily rejected,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: for their explanations are bound to be inferior. This rule is often cited as, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: distinguishing science from other types of knowledge-creation. But if we take, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the view that science is about explanations, we see that this rule is really a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: special case of something that applies naturally to all problem-solving:, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theories that are capable of giving more detailed explanations are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: automatically preferred. They are preferred for two reasons. One is that a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theory that ‘sticks its neck out’ by being more specific about more, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: phenomena opens up itself and its rivals to more forms of criticism, and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: therefore has more chance of taking the problem-solving process forward., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: of experimental testing. That is because most scientific criticism is directed, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: not at a theory’s predictions but directly at the underlying explanations., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Testing the predictions is just an indirect way (albeit an exceptionally, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: powerful one, when available) of testing the explanations. In Chapter 1, I, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: gave the example of the ‘grass cure’ — the theory that eating a kilogram of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: grass is a cure for the common cold. That theory and an infinity of others of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the same ilk are readily testable. But we can criticize and reject them without, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: bothering to do any experiments, purely on the grounds that they explain no, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: more than the prevailing theories which they contradict, yet make new,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: The stages of a scientific discovery shown in Figure 3.3 are seldom, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: completed in sequence at the first attempt. There is usually repeated, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: backtracking before each stage is completed — or rather, solved, for each, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: stage may present a problem whose solution itself requires all five stages of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: a subsidiary problem-solving process. This applies even to stage 1, for the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: initiating problem itself is not immutable. If we cannot think of good, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: candidate solutions we may return to stage 1 and try to reformulate the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: problem, or even choose a different problem. Indeed, apparent insolubility is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: only one of many reasons why we often find it desirable to modify problems, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: we are solving. Some variants of a problem are inevitably more interesting,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: or more relevant to other problems; some are better formulated; some seem, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to be potentially more fruitful, or more urgent — or whatever. In many cases, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: solutions., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: Similarly, if our criticisms at stage 3 fail to distinguish between rival theories,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: we try to invent new methods of criticism. If that does not seem to work we, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: may backtrack to stage 2 and try to sharpen our proposed solutions (and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: existing theories) so as to get more explanations and predictions out of them, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and make it easier to find fault with them. Or we may again backtrack to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Not only is there constant backtracking, but the many sub-problems all, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: remain simultaneously active and are addressed opportunistically. It is only, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: when the discovery is complete that a fairly sequential argument, in a pattern, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: something like Figure 3.3, can be presented. It can begin with the latest and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: best version of the problem; then it can show how some of the rejected, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theories fail criticism; then it can set out the winning theory, and say why it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: survives criticism; then it can explain how one copes without the superseded, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: as they are altered or replaced by new ones. So all the theories are being, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: subjected to variation and selection, according to criteria which are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text:   , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: In fundamental areas of science, observations of ever smaller, more subtle, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: effects are driving us to ever more momentous conclusions about the nature, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of reality. Yet these conclusions cannot be deduced by pure logic from the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: observations. So what makes them compelling? This is the ‘problem of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: induction’. According to inductivism, scientific theories are discovered by, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: extrapolating the results of observations, and justified when corroborating, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: observations are obtained. In fact, inductive reasoning is invalid, and it is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: impossible to extrapolate observations unless one already has an, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explanatory framework for them. But the refutation of inductivism, and also, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the real solution of the problem of induction, depends on recognizing that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: science is a process not of deriving predictions from observations, but of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: finding explanations. We seek explanations when we encounter a problem, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: with existing ones. We then embark on a problem-solving process. New, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explanatory theories begin as unjustified conjectures, which are criticized, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and compared according to the criteria inherent in the problem. Those that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: fail to survive this criticism are abandoned. The survivors become the new, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: prevailing theories, some of which are themselves problematic and so lead, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: us to seek even better explanations. The whole process resembles biological, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text:  The great physicist Galileo Galilei, who was arguably also the first physicist, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: in the modern sense, made many discoveries not only in physics itself but, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: also in the methodology of science. He revived the ancient idea of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: expressing general theories about nature in mathematical form, and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: improved upon it by developing the method of systematic experimental, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: testing, which characterizes science as we know it. He aptly called such, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: tests cimenti, or ‘ordeals’. He was one of the first to use telescopes to study, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: celestial objects, and he collected and analysed evidence for the heliocentric, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theory, the theory that the Earth moves in orbit around the Sun and spins, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: about its own axis. He is best known for his advocacy of that theory, and for, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the bitter conflict with the Church into which that advocacy brought him. In, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: 1633 the Inquisition tried him for heresy, and forced him under the threat of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: torture to kneel and read aloud a long, abject recantation saying that he, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘abjured, cursed and detested’ the heliocentric theory. (Legend has it,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: probably incorrectly, that as he rose to his feet he muttered the words ‘, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: eppur si muove…’, meaning ‘and yet, it does move…’.) Despite his, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: recantation, he was convicted and sentenced to house arrest, under which, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: he remained for the rest of his life. Although this punishment was, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: comparatively lenient, it achieved its purpose handsomely. As Jacob, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Bronowski put it:, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:   , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: The result was silence among Catholic scientists everywhere from then on, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: … The effect of the trial and of the imprisonment was to put a total stop to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: How could a dispute about the layout of the solar system have such far-, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: reaching consequences, and why did the participants pursue it so, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: passionately? Because the real dispute was not about whether the solar, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: system had one layout rather than another: it was about Galileo’s brilliant, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: advocacy of a new and dangerous way of thinking about reality. Not about, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the existence of reality, for both Galileo and the Church believed in realism,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the common-sense view that an external physical universe really does exist, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and does affect our senses, including senses enhanced by instruments such, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: as telescopes. Where Galileo differed was in his conception of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: relationship between physical reality on the one hand, and human ideas,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: observations and reason on the other. He believed that the universe could, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: be understood in terms of universal, mathematically formulated laws, and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that reliable knowledge of these laws was accessible to human beings if they, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: applied his method of mathematical formulation and systematic experimental, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: testing. As he put it, ‘the Book of Nature is written in mathematical symbols’., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: This was in conscious comparison with that other Book on which it was more, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: conventional to rely., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Galileo understood that if his method was indeed reliable, then wherever it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: was applicable its conclusions had to be preferable to those obtained by any, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: other method. Therefore he insisted that scientific reasoning took, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: precedence not only over intuition and common sense, but also over, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: religious doctrine and revelation. It was specifically that idea, and not the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: heliocentric theory as such, that the authorities considered dangerous. (And, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: they were right, for if any idea can be said to have initiated the scientific, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: revolution and the Enlightenment, and to have provided the secular, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: foundation of modern civilization, it is that one.) It was forbidden to ‘hold or, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: defend’ the heliocentric theory as an explanation of the appearance of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: night sky. But using the heliocentric theory, writing about it, holding it ‘as a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mathematical supposition’ or defending it as a method of making predictions, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: were all permitted. That was why Galileo’s book Dialogue of the Two Chief, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: World Systems, which compared the heliocentric theory with the official, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: geocentric theory, had been cleared for printing by the Church censors. The, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Pope had even acquiesced in advance to Galileo’s writing such a book, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: (though at the trial a misleading document was produced, claiming that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Galileo had been forbidden to discuss the issue at all)., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: It is an interesting historical footnote that in Galileo’s time it was not yet, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: indisputable that the heliocentric theory gave better predictions than the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: geocentric theory. The available observations were not very accurate. Ad, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: hoc modifications had been proposed to improve the accuracy of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: geocentric theory, and it was hard to quantify the predictive powers of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: two rival theories. Furthermore, when it comes to details, there is more than, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: one heliocentric theory. Galileo believed that the planets move in circles,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: while in fact their orbits are very nearly ellipses. So the data did not fit the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: particular heliocentric theory that Galileo was defending either. (So much,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: then, for his having been convinced by accumulated observations!) But for, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: all that, the Church took no position in this controversy. The Inquisition did, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: not care where the planets appeared to be; what they cared about was, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: reality. They cared where the planets really were, and they wanted to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: understand the planets through explanations, just as Galileo did., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Instrumentalists and positivists would say that since the Church was, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: perfectly willing to accept Galileo’s observational predictions, further, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: argument between them was pointless, and that his muttering ‘eppur si, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: muove’ was strictly meaningless. But Galileo knew better, and so did the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Inquisition. When they denied the reliability of scientific knowledge, it was, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: precisely the explanatory part of that knowledge that they had in mind., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Their world-view was false, but it was not illogical. Admittedly they believed, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: in revelation and traditional authority as sources of reliable knowledge. But, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: they also had an independent reason for criticizing the reliability of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: knowledge obtained by Galileo’s methods. They could simply point out that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: no amount of observation or argument can ever prove that one explanation, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of a physical phenomenon is true and another false. As they would put it,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: God could produce the same observed effects in an infinity of different ways,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: so it is pure vanity and arrogance to claim to possess a way of knowing,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: merely through one’s own fallible observation and reason, which way He, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: chose., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: To some extent they were merely arguing for modesty, for a recognition of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: human fallibility. And if Galileo was claiming that the heliocentric theory was, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: somehow proven, or nearly so, in some inductive sense, they had a point. If, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Galileo thought that his methods could confer on any theory an authority, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: comparable to that which the Church claimed for its doctrines, they were, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: right to criticize him as arrogant (or, as they would have put it,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: blasphemous), though of course by the same standard they were much, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: more arrogant themselves., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: So how can we defend Galileo against the Inquisition? What should Galileo’s, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: defence have been in the face of this charge of claiming too much when he, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: claimed that scientific theories contain reliable knowledge of reality? The, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Popperian defence of science as a process of problem-solving and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explanation-seeking is not sufficient in itself. For the Church too was, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: primarily interested in explanations and not predictions, and it was quite, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: willing to let Galileo solve problems using any theory he chose. It was just, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that they did not accept that Galileo’s solutions (which they would call mere, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘mathematical hypotheses’) had any bearing on external reality. Problem-, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: solving, after all, is a process that takes place entirely within human minds., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Galileo may have seen the world as a book in which the laws of nature are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: written in mathematical symbols. But that is strictly a metaphor; there are no, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explanations in orbit out there with the planets. The fact is that all our, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: problems and solutions are located within ourselves, having been created by, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ourselves. When we solve problems in science we arrive through argument, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: at theories whose explanations seem best to us. So, without in any way, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: denying that it is right and proper, and useful, for us to solve problems, the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Inquisition and modern sceptics might legitimately ask what scientific, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: problem-solving has to do with reality. We may find our ‘best explanations’, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: psychologically satisfying. We may find them helpful in making predictions., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: We certainly find them essential in every area of technological creativity. All, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: this does justify our continuing to seek them and to use them in those ways., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: But why should we be obliged to take them as fact? The proposition that the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Inquisition forced Galileo to endorse was in effect this: that the Earth is in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: fact at rest, with the Sun and planets in motion around it; but that the paths, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: on which these astronomical bodies travel are laid out in a complex way, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: which, when viewed from the vantage-point of the Earth, is also consistent, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: with the Sun being at rest and the Earth and planets being in motion. Let me, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: call that the ‘Inquisition’s theory’ of the solar system. If the Inquisition’s, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theory were true, we should still expect the heliocentric theory to make, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: accurate predictions of the results of all Earth-based astronomical, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: observations, even though it would be factually false. It would therefore, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: seem that any observations that appear to support the heliocentric theory, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: lend equal support to the Inquisition’s theory., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: One could extend the Inquisition’s theory to account for more detailed, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: observations that support the heliocentric theory, such as observations of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the phases of Venus, and of the small additional motions (called ‘proper, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: motions’) of some stars relative to the celestial sphere. To do this one would, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: have to postulate even more complex manoeuvrings in space, governed by, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: laws of physics very different from those that operate on our supposedly, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: stationary Earth. But they would be different in precisely such a way as to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: remain observationally consistent with the Earth being in motion and the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: laws being the same out there as they are here. Many such theories are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: possible. Indeed, if making the right predictions were our only constraint, we, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: could invent theories which say that anything we please is going on in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: space. For example, observations alone can never rule out the theory that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the Earth is enclosed in a giant planetarium showing us a simulation of a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: heliocentric solar system; and that outside the planetarium there is anything, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: you like, or nothing at all. Admittedly, to account for present-day, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: observations the planetarium would also have to redirect our radar and laser, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: pulses, capture our space probes, and indeed astronauts, send back fake, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: messages from them and return them with appropriate moonrock samples,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: altered memories, and so on. It may be an absurd theory, but the point is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that it cannot be ruled out by experiment. Nor is it valid to rule out any theory, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: solely on the grounds that it is ‘absurd’: the Inquisition, together with most of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the human race in Galileo’s time, thought it the epitome of absurdity to claim, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that the Earth is moving. After all, we cannot feel it moving, can we? When it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: does move, as in an earthquake, we feel that unmistakably. It is said that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Galileo delayed publicly advocating the heliocentric theory for some years,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: not for fear of the Inquisition but simply for fear of ridicule., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: To us, the Inquisition’s theory looks hopelessly contrived. Why should we, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: accept such a complicated and ad hoc account of why the sky looks as it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: does, when the unadorned heliocentric cosmology does the same job with, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: less fuss? We may cite the principle of Occam’s razor: ‘do not multiply, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: entities beyond necessity’ — or, as I prefer to put it, ‘do not complicate, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explanations beyond necessity’, because if you do, the unnecessary, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: complications themselves remain unexplained. However, whether an, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explanation is or is not ‘contrived’ or ‘unnecessarily complicated’ depends on, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: all the other ideas and explanations that make up one’s world-view. The, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Inquisition would have argued that the idea of the Earth moving is an, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: unnecessary complication. It contradicts common sense; it contradicts, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Scripture; and (they would have said) there is a perfectly good explanation, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that does without it., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: But is there? Does the Inquisition’s theory really provide alternative, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explanations without having to introduce the counter-intuitive ‘complication’, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of the heliocentric system? Let us take a closer look at how the Inquisition’s, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theory explains things. It explains the apparent stationarity of the Earth by, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: saying that it is stationary. So far, so good. On the face of it that explanation, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: is better than Galileo’s, for he had to work very hard, and contradict some, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: common-sense notions of force and inertia, to explain why we do not feel the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Earth move. But how does the Inquisition’s theory cope with the more, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: difficult task of explaining planetary motions?, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: The heliocentric theory explains them by saying that the planets are seen to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: move in complicated loops across the sky because they are really moving in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: simple circles (or ellipses) in space, but the Earth is moving as well. The, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Inquisition’s explanation is that the planets are seen to move in complicated, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: loops because they really are moving in complicated loops in space; but, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: (and here, according to the Inquisition’s theory, comes the essence of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explanation) this complicated motion is governed by a simple underlying, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: principle: namely, that the planets move in such a way that, when viewed, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: from the Earth, they appear just as they would if they and the Earth were in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: simple orbits round the Sun., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: To understand planetary motions in terms of the Inquisition’s theory, it is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: essential that one should understand this principle, for the constraints it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: imposes are the basis of every detailed explanation that one can make, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: under the theory. For example, if one were asked why a planetary, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: conjunction occurred on such-and-such a date, or why a planet backtracked, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: across the sky in a loop of a particular shape, the answer would always be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘because that is how it would look if the heliocentric theory were true’. So, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: here is a cosmology — the Inquisition’s cosmology — that can be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: understood only in terms of a different cosmology, the heliocentric, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: cosmology that it contradicts but faithfully mimics., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: If the Inquisition had seriously tried to understand the world in terms of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theory they tried to force on Galileo, they would also have understood its, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: fatal weakness, namely that it fails to solve the problem it purports to solve. It, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: does not explain planetary motions ‘without having to introduce the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: complication of the heliocentric system’. On the contrary, it unavoidably, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: incorporates that system as part of its own principle for explaining planetary, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: motions. One cannot understand the world through the Inquisition’s theory, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: unless one understands the heliocentric theory first., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Therefore we are right to regard the Inquisition’s theory as a convoluted, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: elaboration of the heliocentric theory, rather than vice versa. We have, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: arrived at this conclusion not by judging the Inquisition’s theory against, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: modern cosmology, which would have been a circular argument, but by, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: insisting on taking the Inquisition’s theory seriously, in its own terms, as an, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explanation of the world. I have mentioned the grass-cure theory, which can, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: be ruled out without experimental testing because it contains no explanation., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Here we have a theory which can also be ruled out without experimental, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: testing, because it contains a bad explanation — an explanation which, in its, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: own terms, is worse than its rival., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: As I have said, the Inquisition were realists. Yet their theory has this in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: common with solipsism: both of them draw an arbitrary boundary beyond, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: which, they claim, human reason has no access — or at least, beyond which, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: problem-solving is no path to understanding. For solipsists, the boundary, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: tightly encloses their own brains, or perhaps just their abstract minds or, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: incorporeal souls. For the Inquisition, it enclosed the entire Earth. Some, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: present-day Creationists believe in a similar boundary, not in space but in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: time, for they believe that the universe was created only six thousand years, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ago, complete with misleading evidence of earlier events. Behaviourism is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the doctrine that it is not meaningful to explain human behaviour in terms of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: inner mental processes. To behaviourists, the only legitimate psychology is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the study of people’s observable responses to external stimuli. Thus they, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: draw exactly the same boundary as solipsists, separating the human mind, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: from external reality; but while solipsists deny that it is meaningful to reason, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: about anything outside that boundary, behaviourists deny that it is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: meaningful to reason about anything inside., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: There is a large class of related theories here, but we can usefully regard, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: them all as variants of solipsism. They differ in where they draw the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: boundary of reality (or the boundary of that part of reality which is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: comprehensible through problem-solving), and they differ in whether, and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: how, they seek knowledge outside that boundary. But they all consider, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: scientific rationality and other problem-solving to be inapplicable outside the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: boundary — a mere game. They might concede that it can be a satisfying, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and useful game, but it is nevertheless only a game from which no valid, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: conclusion can be drawn about the reality outside., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: They are also alike in their basic objection to problem-solving as a means of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: creating knowledge, which is that it does not deduce its conclusions from, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: any ultimate source of justification. Within the respective boundaries that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: they choose, the adherents of all these theories do rely on the methodology, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of problem-solving, confident that seeking the best available explanation is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: also the way of finding the truest available theory. But for the truth of what, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: lies outside those boundaries, they look elsewhere, and what they all seek is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: a source of ultimate justification. For religious people, divine revelation can, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: play that role. Solipsists trust only the direct experience of their own, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: thoughts, as expressed in Rene Descartes’s classic argument cogito ergo, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: sum (‘I think, therefore I exist’)., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Despite Descartes’s desire to base his philosophy on this supposedly firm, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: foundation, he actually allowed himself many other assumptions, and he was, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: certainly no solipsist. Indeed, there can have been very few, if any, genuine, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: solipsists in history. Solipsism is usually defended only as a means of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: attacking scientific reasoning, or as a stepping-stone to one of its many, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: variants. By the same token, a good way of defending science against a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: variety of criticisms, and of understanding the true relationship between, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: reason and reality, is to consider the argument against solipsism., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: There is a standard philosophical joke about a professor who gives a lecture, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: in defence of solipsism. So persuasive is the lecture that as soon as it ends,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: several enthusiastic students hurry forward to shake the professor’s hand., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘Wonderful. I agreed with every word,’ says one student earnestly. ‘So did I,’, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: says another. ‘I am very gratified to hear it,’ says the professor. ‘One so, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: seldom has the opportunity to meet fellow solipsists.’, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Implicit in this joke there is a genuine argument against solipsism. One could, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: put it like this. What, exactly, was the theory that the students in the story, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: were agreeing with? Was it the professor’s theory, that they themselves do, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: not exist because only the professor exists? To believe that, they would first, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: have had to find some way round Descartes’s cogito ergo sum argument., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: And if they managed that, they would not be solipsists, for the central thesis, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of solipsism is that the solipsist exists. Or has each student been persuaded, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of a theory contradicting the professor’s, the theory that that particular, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: student exists, but the professor and the other students do not? That would, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: indeed make them all solipsists, but none of the students would be agreeing, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: with the theory that the professor was defending. Therefore neither of these, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: two possibilities amounts to the students’ having been persuaded by the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: professor’s defence of solipsism. If they adopt the professor’s opinion, they, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: will not be solipsists, and if they become solipsists, they will have become, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: convinced that the professor is mistaken., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: This argument is trying to show that solipsism is literally indefensible,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: because by accepting such a defence one is implicitly contradicting it. But, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: our solipsistic professor could try to evade that argument by saying, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: something like this: ‘I can and do consistently defend solipsism. Not against, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: other people, for there are no other people, but against opposing arguments., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: These arguments come to my attention through dream-people, who behave, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: as if they were thinking beings whose ideas often oppose mine. My lecture, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and the arguments it contains were not intended to persuade these dream-, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: people, but to persuade myself — to help me to clarify my ideas.’, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: However, if there are sources of ideas that behave as if they were, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: independent of oneself, then they necessarily are independent of oneself., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: For if I define ‘myself as the conscious entity that has the thoughts and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: feelings I am aware of having, then the ‘dream-people’ I seem to interact, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: with are by definition something other than that narrowly defined self, and so, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: I must concede that something other than myself exists. My only other, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: option, if I were a committed solipsist, would be to regard the dream-people, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: as creations of my unconscious mind, and therefore as part of ‘myself in a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: looser sense. But then I should be forced to concede that ‘myself had a very, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: rich structure, most of which is independent of my conscious self. Within that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: structure are entities — dream-people — who, despite being mere, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: constituents of the mind of a supposed solipsist, behave exactly as if they, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: were committed anti-solipsists. So I could not call myself wholly a solipsist,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: for only my narrowly defined self would take that view. Many, apparently, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: most, of the opinions held within my mind as a whole would oppose, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: solipsism. I could study the ‘outer’ region of myself and find that it seems to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: obey certain laws, the same laws as the dream-textbooks say apply to what, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: they call the physical universe. I would find that there is far more of the outer, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: region than the inner region. Aside from containing more ideas, it is also, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: more complex, more varied, and has more measurable variables, by a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: literally astronomical factor, than the inner region., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Moreover, this outer region is amenable to scientific study, using the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: methods of Galileo. Because I have now been forced to define that region as, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: part of myself, solipsism no longer has any argument against the validity of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: such study, which is now defined as no more than a form of introspection., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Solipsism allows, indeed assumes, that knowledge of oneself can be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: obtained through introspection. It cannot declare the entities and processes, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: being studied to be unreal, since the reality of the self is its basic postulate., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Thus we see that if we take solipsism seriously — if we assume that it is true, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and that all valid explanations must scrupulously conform to it — it self-, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: destructs. How exactly does solipsism, taken seriously, differ from its, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: common-sense rival, realism? The difference is based on no more than a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: renaming scheme. Solipsism insists on referring to objectively different, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: things (such as external reality and my unconscious mind, or introspection, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and scientific observation) by the same names. But then it has to reintroduce, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the distinction through explanations in terms of something like the ‘outer part, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of myself.’ But no such extra explanations would be necessary without its, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: insistence on an inexplicable renaming scheme. Solipsism must also, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: postulate the existence of an additional class of processes — invisible,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: inexplicable processes which give the mind the illusion of living in an, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: external reality. The solipsist, who believes that nothing exists other than the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: contents of one mind, must also believe that that mind is a phenomenon of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: greater multiplicity than is normally supposed. It contains other-people-like, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: thoughts, planet-like thoughts and laws-of-physics-like thoughts. These, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: thoughts are real. They develop in a complex way (or pretend to), and they, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: have enough autonomy to surprise, disappoint, enlighten or thwart that other, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: class of thoughts which call themselves ‘I.’ Thus the solipsist’s explanation of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the world is in terms of interacting thoughts rather than interacting objects., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: But those thoughts are real, and interact according to the same rules that the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: realist says govern the interaction of objects. Thus solipsism, far from being, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: a world-view stripped to its essentials, is actually just realism disguised and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: weighed down by additional unnecessary assumptions — worthless, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: baggage, introduced only to be explained away., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: By this argument we can dispense with solipsism and all the related theories., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: They are all indefensible. Incidentally, we have already rejected one world-, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: view on these grounds, namely positivism (the theory that all statements, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: other than those describing or predicting observations are meaningless). As I, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: remarked in Chapter 1, positivism asserts its own meaninglessness, and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: therefore cannot be consistently defended., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: So we can continue, reassured, with common-sense realism and the pursuit, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of explanations by scientific methods. But in the light of this conclusion, what, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: can we say about the arguments that made solipsism and its relatives, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: superficially plausible, namely that they could neither be proved false nor, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ruled out by experiment? What is the status of those arguments now? If we, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: have neither proved solipsism false nor ruled it out by experiment, what have, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: we done?, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: There is an assumption built into this question. It is that theories can be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: classified in a hierarchy, ‘mathematical’ —> ‘scientific’ —> ‘philosophical’, of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: decreasing intrinsic reliability. Many people take the existence of this, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: hierarchy for granted, despite the fact that these judgements of comparative, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: reliability depend entirely on philosophical arguments, arguments that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: classify themselves as quite unreliable! In fact, the idea of this hierarchy is a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: cousin of the reductionist mistake I discussed in Chapter 1 (the theory that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: microscopic laws and phenomena are more fundamental than emergent, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ones). The same assumption occurs in inductivism, which supposes that we, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: can be absolutely certain of the conclusions of mathematical arguments, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: because they are deductive, reasonably sure of scientific arguments, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: because they are ‘inductive’, and forever undecided about philosophical, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: arguments, which it sees as little more than matters of taste., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: But none of that is true. Explanations are not justified by the means by which, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: they were derived; they are justified by their superior ability, relative to rival, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explanations, to solve the problems they address. That is why the argument, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that a theory is indefensible can be so compelling. A prediction, or any, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: assertion, that cannot be defended might still be true, but an explanation that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: cannot be defended is not an explanation. The rejection of ‘mere’, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explanations on the grounds that they are not justified by any ultimate, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explanation inevitably propels one into futile searches for an ultimate source, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of justification. There is no such source., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Nor is there that hierarchy of reliability from mathematical to scientific to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: philosophical arguments. Some philosophical arguments, including the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: argument against solipsism, are far more compelling than any scientific, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: argument. Indeed, every scientific argument assumes the falsity not only of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: solipsism, but also of other philosophical theories including any number of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: variants of solipsism that might contradict specific parts of the scientific, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: argument. I shall also show (in Chapter 10) that even purely mathematical, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: arguments derive their reliability from the physical and philosophical theories, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that underpin them, and therefore that they cannot, after all, yield absolute, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: certainty., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Having embraced realism, we are continually faced with decisions as to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: whether entities referred to in competing explanations are real or not., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Deciding that they are not real — as we did in the case of the ‘angel’ theory, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of planetary motion — is equivalent to rejecting the corresponding, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explanation. Thus, in searching for and judging explanations, we need more, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: than just a refutation of solipsism. We need to develop reasons for accepting, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: or rejecting the existence of entities that may appear in contending theories;, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: in other words, we need a criterion for reality. We should not, of course,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: expect to find a final or an infallible criterion. Our judgements of what is or is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: not real always depend on the various explanations that are available to us,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and sometimes change as our explanations improve. In the nineteenth, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: century, few things would have been regarded more confidently as real than, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the force of gravity. Not only did it figure in Newton’s then-unrivalled system, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of laws, but everyone could feel it, all the time, even with their eyes shut —, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: or so they thought. Today we understand gravity through Einstein’s theory, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: rather than Newton’s, and we know that no such force exists. We do not feel, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: it! What we feel is the resistance that prevents us from penetrating the solid, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ground beneath our feet. Nothing is pulling us downwards. The only reason, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: why we fall downwards when unsupported is that the fabric of space and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: time in which we exist is curved., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Not only do explanations change, but our criteria and ideas about what, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: should count as an explanation are gradually changing (improving) too. So, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the list of acceptable modes of explanation will always be open-ended, and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: consequently the list of acceptable criteria for reality must be open-ended, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: too. But what is it about an explanation — given that, for whatever reasons,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: we find it satisfactory — that should make us classify some things as real, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and others as illusory or imaginary?, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: James Boswell relates in his Life of Johnson how he and Dr Johnson were, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: discussing Bishop Berkeley’s solipsistic theory of the non-existence of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: material world. Boswell remarked that although no one believed the theory,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: no one could refute it either. Dr Johnson kicked a large rock and said, as his, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: foot rebounded, ‘I refute it thus.’ Dr Johnson’s point was that Berkeley’s, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: denial of the rock’s existence is incompatible with finding an explanation of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the rebound that he himself felt. Solipsism cannot accommodate any, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explanation of why that experiment — or any experiment — should have one, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: outcome rather than another. To explain the effect that the rock had on him,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Dr Johnson was forced to take a position on the nature of rocks. Were they, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: part of an autonomous external reality, or were they figments of his, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: imagination? In the latter case he would have to conclude that ‘his, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: imagination’ was itself a vast, complex, autonomous universe. The same, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: dilemma confronted the solipsistic professor who, if pressed for, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explanations, would be forced to take a position on the nature of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: audience. And the Inquisition would have had to take a position on the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: source of the underlying regularity in the motion of planets, a regularity that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: is explicable only by reference to the heliocentric theory. For all these, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: people, taking their own position seriously as an explanation of the world, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: would lead them directly to realism and Galilean rationality., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: But Dr Johnson’s idea is more than a refutation of solipsism. It also, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: illustrates the criterion for reality that is used in science, namely, if something, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: can kick back, it exists. ‘Kicking back’ here does not necessarily mean that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the alleged object is responding to being kicked — to being physically, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: affected as Dr Johnson’s rock was. It is enough that when we ‘kick’, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: something, the object affects us in ways that require independent, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explanation. For example, Galileo had no means of affecting planets, but he, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: could affect the light that came from them. His equivalent of kicking the rock, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: was refracting that light through the lenses of his telescopes and eyes. That, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: light responded by ‘kicking’ his retina back. The way it kicked back allowed, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: him to conclude not only that the light was real, but that the heliocentric, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: planetary motions required to explain the patterns in which the light arrived, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: were also real., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: By the way, Dr Johnson did not directly kick the rock either. A person is a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mind, not a body. The Dr Johnson who performed the experiment was a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mind, and that mind directly ‘kicked’ only some nerves, which transmitted, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: signals to muscles, which propelled his foot towards the rock. Shortly, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: afterwards, Dr Johnson perceived being ‘kicked back’ by the rock, but again, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: only indirectly, after the impact had set up a pressure pattern in his shoe,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and then in his skin, and had then led to electrical impulses in his nerves,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and so forth. Dr Johnson’s mind, like Galileo’s and everyone else’s, ‘kicked’, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: nerves and ‘was kicked back’ by nerves, and inferred the existence and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: properties of reality from those interactions alone. What Dr Johnson was, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: entitled to infer about reality depends on how he could best explain what had, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: happened. For example, if the sensation had seemed to depend only on the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: extension of his leg, and not on external factors, then he would probably, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: have concluded that it was a property of his leg, or of his mind alone. He, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: might have been suffering from a disease which gave him a rebounding, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: sensation whenever he extended his leg in a certain way. But in fact the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: rebounding depended on what the rock did, such as being in a certain place,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: which was in turn related to other effects that the rock had, such as being, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: seen, or affecting other people who kicked it. Dr Johnson perceived these, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: effects to be autonomous (independent of himself) and quite complicated., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Therefore the realist explanation of why the rock produces the rebounding, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: sensation involves a complicated story about something autonomous. But so, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: does the solipsist explanation. In fact, any explanation that accounts for the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: foot-rebounding phenomenon is necessarily a ‘complicated story about, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: something autonomous’. It must in effect be the story of the rock. The, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: solipsist would call it a dream-rock, but apart from that claim the solipsist’s, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: story and the realist’s could share the same script., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: My discussion of shadows and parallel universes in Chapter 2 revolved, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: around questions of what does or does not exist, and implicitly around what, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: should or should not count as evidence of existence. I used Dr Johnson’s, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: criterion. Consider again the point X on the screen in Figure 2.7 (p. 41),, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: which is illuminated when only two slits are open but goes dark when two, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: further slits are opened. I said that it is an ‘inescapable’ conclusion that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: something must be coming through the second pair of slits to prevent the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: light from the first pair from reaching X. It is not logically inescapable, for if, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: we were not looking for explanations we could just say that the photons we, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: see behave as if something passing through other slits had deflected them,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: but that in fact there is nothing there. Similarly, Dr Johnson could have said, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that his foot rebounded as if a rock had been there, but that in fact there was, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: nothing there. The Inquisition did say that the planets were seen to move as, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: if they and the Earth were in orbit round the Sun, but that in fact they moved, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: round the fixed Earth. But if the object of the exercise is to explain the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: motion of planets, or the motion of photons, we must do as Dr Johnson did., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: We must adopt a methodological rule that if something behaves as if it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: existed, by kicking back, then one regards that as evidence that it does exist., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Shadow photons kick back by interfering with the photons that we see, and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: therefore shadow photons exist., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Can we likewise conclude from Dr Johnson’s criterion that ‘planets move as, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: if they were being pushed by angels; therefore angels exist’? No, but only, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: because we have a better explanation. The angel theory of planetary motion, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: is not wholly without merit. It does explain why planets move independently, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of the celestial sphere, and that does indeed make it superior to solipsism., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: But it does not explain why the angels should push the planets along one set, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of orbits rather than another, or, in particular, why they should push them as, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: if their motion were determined by a curvature of space and time, as, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: specified in every detail by the universal laws of the general theory of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: relativity. That is why the angel theory cannot compete as an explanation, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: with the theories of modern physics., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Similarly, to postulate that angels come through the other slits and deflect, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: our photons would be better than nothing. But we can do better than that., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: We know exactly how those angels would have to behave: very much like, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: photons. So we have a choice between an explanation in terms of invisible, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: angels pretending to be photons, and one in terms of invisible photons. In, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the absence of an independent explanation for why angels should pretend to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: be photons, that latter explanation is superior., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: We do not feel the presence of our counterparts in other universes. Nor did, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the Inquisition feel the Earth moving beneath their feet. And yet, it moves!, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Now, consider what it would feel like if we did exist in multiple copies,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: interacting only through the imperceptibly slight effects of quantum, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: interference. This is the equivalent of what Galileo did when he analysed, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: how the Earth would feel to us if it were moving in accordance with the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: heliocentric theory. He discovered that the motion would be imperceptible., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Yet perhaps ‘imperceptible’ is not quite the right word here. Neither the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: motion of the Earth nor the presence of parallel universes is directly, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: perceptible, but then neither is anything else (except perhaps, if Descartes’s, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: argument holds, your own bare existence). But both things are perceptible in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the sense that they perceptibly ‘kick back’ at us if we examine them through, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: scientific instruments. We can see a Foucault pendulum swing in a plane, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that gradually seems to turn, revealing the rotation of the Earth beneath it., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: And we can detect photons that have been deflected by interference from, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: their other-universe counterparts. It is only an accident of evolution, as it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: were, that the senses we are born with are not adapted to feel such things, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘directly’., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: It is not how hard something kicks back that makes the theory of its, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: existence compelling. What matters is its role in the explanations that such a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theory provides. I have given examples from physics where very tiny ‘kicks’, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: lead us to momentous conclusions about reality because we have no other, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explanation. The converse can also happen: if there is no clear-cut winner, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: among the contending explanations, then even a very powerful ‘kick’ may, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: not convince us that the supposed source has independent reality. For, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: example, you may one day see terrifying monsters attacking you — and then, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: wake up. If the explanation that they originated within your own mind seems, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: adequate, it would be irrational for you to conclude that there really are such, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: monsters out there. If you feel a sudden pain in your shoulder as you walk, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: down a busy street, and look around, and see nothing to explain it, you may, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: wonder whether the pain was caused by an unconscious part of your own, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mind, or by your body, or by something outside. You may consider it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: possible that a hidden prankster has shot you with an air-gun, yet come to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: no conclusion as to the reality of such a person. But if you then saw an air-, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: gun pellet rolling away on the pavement, you might conclude that no, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explanation solved the problem as well as the air-gun explanation, in which, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: case you would adopt it. In other words, you would tentatively infer the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: existence of a person you had not seen, and might never see, just because, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of that person’s role in the best explanation available to you. Clearly the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theory of such a person’s existence is not a logical consequence of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: observed evidence (which, incidentally, would consist of a single, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: observation). Nor does that theory have the form of an ‘inductive, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: generalization’, for example that you will observe the same thing again if you, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: perform the same experiment. Nor is the theory experimentally testable:, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: experiment could never prove the absence of a hidden prankster. Despite all, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that, the argument in favour of the theory could be overwhelmingly, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: convincing, if it were the best explanation., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Whenever I have used Dr Johnson’s criterion to argue for the reality of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: something, one attribute in particular has always been relevant, namely, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: complexity. We prefer simpler explanations to more complex ones. And we, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: prefer explanations that are capable of accounting for detail and complexity, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to explanations that can account only for simple aspects of phenomena. Dr, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Johnson’s criterion tells us to regard as real those complex entities which, if, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: we did not regard them as real, would complicate our explanations. For, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: instance, we must regard the planets as real, because if we did not we, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: should be forced into complicated explanations of a cosmic planetarium, or, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of altered laws of physics, or of angels, or of whatever else would, under that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: assumption, be giving us the illusion that there are planets out there in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: space., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Thus the observed complexity in the structure or behaviour of an entity is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: part of the evidence that that entity is real. But it is not sufficient evidence., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: We do not, for example, deem our reflections in a mirror to be real people., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Of course, illusions themselves are real physical processes. But the illusory, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: entities they show us need not be considered real, because they derive their, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: complexity from somewhere else. They are not autonomously complex. Why, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: do we accept the ‘mirror’ theory of reflections, but reject the ‘planetarium’, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theory of the solar system? It is because, given a simple explanation of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: action of mirrors, we can understand that nothing of what we see in them, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: genuinely lies behind them. No further explanation is needed because the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: reflections, though complex, are not autonomous — their complexity is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: merely borrowed from our side of the mirror. That is not so for planets. The, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theory that the cosmic planetarium is real, and that nothing lies beyond it,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: only makes the problem worse. For if we accepted it, then instead of asking, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: only how the solar system works we should first have to ask how the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: planetarium works, and then how the solar system it is displaying works. We, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: could not avoid the latter question, and it is effectively a repetition of what we, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: were trying to answer in the first place. Now we can rephrase Dr Johnson’s, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: criterion thus:, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:   , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: If, according to the simplest explanation, an entity is complex and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: autonomous, then that entity is real., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Computational complexity theory is the branch of computer science that is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: concerned with what resources (such as time, memory capacity or energy), Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: are required to perform given classes of computations. The complexity of a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: piece of information is defined in terms of the computational resources (such, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: as the length of the program, the number of computational steps or the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: amount of memory) that a computer would need if it was to reproduce that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: piece of information. Several different definitions of complexity are in use,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: each with its own domain of applicability. The exact definitions need not, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: concern us here, but they are all based on the idea that a complex process, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: is one that in effect presents us with the results of a substantial computation., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: The sense in which the motion of the planets ‘presents us with the results of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: a substantial computation’ is well illustrated by a planetarium. Consider a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: planetarium controlled by a computer which calculates the exact image that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the projectors should display to represent the night sky. To do this, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: authentically, the computer has to use the formulae provided by, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: astronomical theories; in fact the computation is identical to the one that it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: would perform if it were calculating predictions of where an observatory, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: should point its telescopes to see real planets and stars. What we mean by, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: saying that the appearance of the planetarium is ‘as complex’ as that of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: night sky it depicts is that those two computations — one describing the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: night sky, the other describing the planetarium — are largely identical. So we, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: can re-express Dr Johnson’s criterion again, in terms of hypothetical, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: computations:, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:   , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: If a substantial amount of computation would be required to give us the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: illusion that a certain entity is real, then that entity is real., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: If Dr Johnson’s leg invariably rebounded when he extended it, then the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: source of his illusions (God, a virtual-reality machine, or whatever) would, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: need to perform only a simple computation to determine when to give him, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the rebounding sensation (something like ‘if leg-is-extended then rebound, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: …’). But to reproduce what Dr Johnson experienced in a realistic experiment, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: it would be necessary to take into account where the rock is, and whether Dr, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Johnson’s foot is going to hit or miss it, and how heavy, how hard and how, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: firmly lodged it is, and whether anyone else has just kicked it out of the way,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and so on — a vast computation., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Physicists trying to cling to a single-universe world-view sometimes try to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explain quantum interference phenomena as follows: ‘No shadow photons, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: exist,’ they say, ‘and what carries the effect of the distant slits to the photon, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: we see is — nothing. Some sort of Action at a distance (as in Newton’s law, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of gravity) simply makes photons change course when a distant slit is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: opened.’ But there is nothing ‘simple’ about this supposed action at a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: distance. The appropriate physical law would have to say that a photon is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: affected by distant objects exactly as if something were passing through the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: distant gaps and bouncing off the distant mirrors so as to intercept that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: photon at the right time and place. Calculating how a photon reacts to these, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: distant objects would require the same computational effort as working out, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the history of large numbers of shadow photons. The computation would, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: have to work its way through a story of what each shadow photon does: it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: bounces off this, is stopped by that, and so on. Therefore, just as with Dr, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Johnson’s rock, and just as with Galileo’s planets, a story that is in effect, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: about shadow photons necessarily appears in any explanation of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: observed effects. The irreducible complexity of that story makes it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: philosophically untenable to deny that the objects exist., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: The physicist David Bohm constructed a theory with predictions identical to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: those of quantum theory, in which a sort of wave accompanies every photon,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: washes over the entire barrier, passes through the slits and interferes with, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the photon that we see. Bohm’s theory is often presented as a single-, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: universe variant of quantum theory. But according to Dr Johnson’s criterion,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that is a mistake. Working out what Bohm’s invisible wave will do requires, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the same computations as working out what trillions of shadow photons will, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: do. Some parts of the wave describe us, the observers, detecting and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: reacting to the photons; other parts of the wave describe other versions of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: us, reacting to photons in different positions. Bohm’s modest nomenclature, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: — referring to most of reality as a ‘wave’ — does not change the fact that in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: his theory reality consists of large nets of complex entities, each of which, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: I have described Galileo’s new conception of our relationship with external, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: reality as a great methodological discovery. It gave us a new, reliable form of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: reasoning involving observational evidence. That is indeed one aspect of his, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: discovery: scientific reasoning is reliable, not in the sense that it certifies that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: any particular theory will survive unchanged, even until tomorrow, but in the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: sense that we are right to rely on it. For we are right to seek solutions to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: problems rather than sources of ultimate justification. Observational, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: evidence is indeed evidence, not in the sense that any theory can be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: deduced, induced or in any other way inferred from it, but in the sense that it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: can constitute a genuine reason for preferring one theory to another., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: But there is another side to Galileo’s discovery which is much less often, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: appreciated. The reliability of scientific reasoning is not just an attribute of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: us, of our knowledge and our relationship with reality. It is also a new fact, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: about physical reality itself, a fact which Galileo expressed in the phrase ‘the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Book of Nature is written in mathematical symbols’. As I have said, it is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: impossible literally to ‘read’ any shred of a theory in nature: that is the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: inductivist mistake. But what is genuinely out there is evidence, or, more, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: precisely, a reality that will respond with evidence if we interact appropriately, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: with it. Given a shred of a theory, or rather, shreds of several rival theories,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the evidence is available out there to enable us to distinguish between them., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Anyone can search for it, find it and improve upon it if they take the trouble., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: They do not need authorization, or initiation, or holy texts. They need only be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: looking in the right way — with fertile problems and promising theories in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mind. This open accessibility, not only of evidence but of the whole, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mechanism of knowledge acquisition, is a key attribute of Galileo’s, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: conception of reality., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Galileo may have thought this self-evident, but it is not. It is a substantive, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: assertion about what physical reality is like. Logically, reality need not have, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: had this science-friendly property, but it does — and in abundance. Galileo’s, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: universe is saturated with evidence. Copernicus had assembled evidence for, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: his heliocentric theory in Poland. Tycho Brahe had collected his evidence in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Denmark, and Kepler had in Germany. And by pointing his telescope at the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: skies over Italy, Galileo gained greater access to the same evidence. Every, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: part of the Earth’s surface, on every clear night, for billions of years, has, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: been deluged with evidence about the facts and laws of astronomy. For, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: many other sciences evidence has similarly been on display, to be viewed, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: more clearly in modern times by microscopes and other instruments. Where, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: evidence is not already physically present, we can bring it into existence with, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: devices such as lasers and pierced barriers — devices which it is open to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: anyone, anywhere and at any time, to build. And the evidence will be the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: same, regardless of who reveals it. The more fundamental a theory is, the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: more readily available is the evidence that bears upon it (to those who know, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: how to look), not just on Earth but throughout the multiverse., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Thus physical reality is self-similar on several levels: among the stupendous, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: complexities of the universe and multiverse, some patterns are nevertheless, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: endlessly repeated. Earth and Jupiter are in many ways dramatically, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: dissimilar planets, but they both move in ellipses, and they are made of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: same set of a hundred or so chemical elements (albeit in different, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: proportions), and so are their parallel-universe counterparts. The evidence, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that so impressed Galileo and his contemporaries also exists on other, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: planets and in distant galaxies. The evidence being considered at this, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: moment by physicists and astronomers would also have been available a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: billion years ago, and will still be available a billion years hence. The very, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: existence of general, explanatory theories implies that disparate objects and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: events are physically alike in some ways. The light reaching us from distant, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: galaxies is, after all, only light, but it looks to us like galaxies. Thus reality, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: contains not only evidence, but also the means (such as our minds, and our, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: artefacts) of understanding it. There are mathematical symbols in physical, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: reality. The fact that it is we who put them there does not make them any, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: less physical. In those symbols — in our planetariums, books, films and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: computer memories, and in our brains — there are images of physical reality, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: at large, images not just of the appearance of objects, but of the structure of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: reality. There are laws and explanations, reductive and emergent. There are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text:  The theory of computation has traditionally been studied almost entirely in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the abstract, as a topic in pure mathematics. This is to miss the point of it., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Computers are physical objects, and computations are physical processes., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: What computers can or cannot compute is determined by the laws of physics, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: alone, and not by pure mathematics. One of the most important concepts of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the theory of computation is universality. A universal computer is usually, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: defined as an abstract machine that can mimic the computations of any, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: other abstract machine in a certain well-defined class. However, the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: significance of universality lies in the fact that universal computers, or at, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: least good approximations to them, can actually be built, and can be used to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: compute not just each other’s behaviour but the behaviour of interesting, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: physical and abstract entities. The fact that this is possible is part of the self-, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: similarity of physical reality that I mentioned in the previous chapter., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: The best-known physical manifestation of universality is an area of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: technology that has been mooted for decades but is only now beginning to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: take off, namely virtual reality. The term refers to any situation in which a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: person is artificially given the experience of being in a specified environment., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: For example, a flight simulator — a machine that gives pilots the experience, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of flying an aircraft without their having to leave the ground — is a type of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: virtual-reality generator. Such a machine (or more precisely, the computer, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that controls it) can be programmed with the characteristics of a real or, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: imaginary aircraft. The aircraft’s environment, such as the weather and the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: layout of airports, can also be specified in the program. As the pilot practises, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: flying from one airport to another, the simulator causes the appropriate, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: images to appear at the windows, the appropriate jolts and accelerations to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: be felt, the corresponding readings to be shown on the instruments, and so, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: on. It can incorporate the effects of, for example, turbulence, mechanical, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: failure and proposed modifications to the aircraft. Thus a flight simulator can, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: give the user a wide range of piloting experiences, including some that no, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: real aircraft could: the simulated aircraft could have performance, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Since we experience our environment through our senses, any virtual-reality, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: generator must be able to manipulate our senses, overriding their normal, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: functioning so that we can experience the specified environment instead of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: our actual one. This may sound like something out of Aldous Huxley’s Brave, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: the user: specified pictures, sounds, odours, and so on all count as ‘images’., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: rudimentary sort of virtual-reality generator, but the term ‘virtual reality’ is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: usually reserved for cases where there is both a wide coverage of the user’s, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: sensory range, and a substantial element of interaction (‘kicking back’), Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Present-day video games do allow interaction between the player and the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: game objects, but usually only a small fraction of the user’s sensory range is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: covered. The rendered ‘environment’ consists of images on a small screen,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and a proportion of the sounds that the user hears. But virtual-reality video, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: games more worthy of the term do already exist. Typically, the user wears a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: helmet with built-in headphones and two television screens, one for each, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: eye, and perhaps special gloves and other clothing lined with electrically, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: controlled effectors (pressure-generating devices). There are also sensors, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that detect the motion of parts of the user’s body, especially the head. The, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: information about what the user is doing is passed to a computer, which, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: calculates what the user should be seeing, hearing and feeling, and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: responds by sending appropriate signals to the image generators (Figure, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: 5.1). When the user looks to the left or right, the pictures on the two, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: television screens pan, just as a real field of view would, to show whatever is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: on the user’s left or right in the simulated world. The user can reach out and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: coincidences, for these too are phenomena which seem to show us, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: something real but actually mislead us. We have seen that the scientific, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: world-view can accommodate — indeed, expects — the existence of highly, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: misleading phenomena. It is par excellence the world-view that can, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: accommodate both human fallibility and external sources of error., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Nevertheless, misleading phenomena are basically unwelcome. Except for, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: their curiosity value, or when we learn from them why we are misled, they, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: are things we try to avoid and would rather do without. But virtual reality is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: not in that category. We shall see that the existence of virtual reality does, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: not indicate that the human capacity to understand the world is inherently, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: limited, but, on the contrary, that it is inherently unlimited. It is no anomaly, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: brought about by the accidental properties of human sense organs, but is a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: fundamental property of the multiverse at large. And the fact that the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: multiverse has this property, far from being a minor embarrassment for, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: realism and science, is essential for both — it is the very property that makes, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: science possible. It is not something that ‘we would rather do without’; it is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: something that we literally could not do without., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: These may seem rather lofty claims to make on behalf of flight simulators, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and video games. But it is the phenomenon of virtual reality in general that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: occupies a central place in the scheme of things, not any particular virtual-, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: reality generator. So I want to consider virtual reality in as general a way as, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: possible. What, if any, are its ultimate limits? What sorts of environment can, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: in principle be artificially rendered, and with what accuracy? By ‘in principle’ I, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mean ignoring transient limitations of technology, but taking into account all, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: limitations that may be imposed by the principles of logic and physics., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: The way I have defined it, a virtual-reality generator is a machine that gives, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the user experiences of some real or imagined environment (such as an, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: aircraft) which is, or seems to be, outside the user’s mind. Let me call those, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: external experiences. External experiences are to be contrasted with, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: internal experiences such as one’s nervousness when making one’s first, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: solo landing, or one’s surprise at the sudden appearance of a thunderstorm, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: out of a clear blue sky. A virtual-reality generator indirectly causes the user, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to have internal experiences as well as external ones, but it cannot be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: programmed to render a specific internal experience. For example, a pilot, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: who makes roughly the same flight twice in the simulator will have roughly, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: the same external experiences on both occasions, but on the second, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: occasion will probably be less surprised when the thunderstorm appears. Of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: course on the second occasion the pilot would probably also react differently, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to the appearance of the thunderstorm, and that would make the subsequent, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: external experiences different too. But the point is that although one can, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: program the machine to make a thunderstorm appear in the pilot’s field of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: view whenever one likes, one cannot program it to make the pilot think, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: whatever one likes in response., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: One can conceive of a technology beyond virtual reality, which could also, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: induce specified internal experiences. A few internal experiences, such as, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: moods induced by certain drugs, can already be artificially rendered, and no, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: doubt in future it will be possible to extend that repertoire. But a generator of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: specifiable internal experiences would in general have to be able to override, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the normal functioning of the user’s mind as well as the senses. In other, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: words, it would be replacing the user by a different person. This puts such, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: machines into a different category from virtual-reality generators. They will, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: require quite different technology and will raise quite different philosophical, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: issues, which is why I have excluded them from my definition of virtual, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: reality., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Another type of experience which certainly cannot be artificially rendered is a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: logically impossible one. I have said that a flight simulator can create the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: experience of a physically impossible flight through a mountain. But nothing, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: can create the experience of factorizing the number 181, because that is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: logically impossible: 181 is a prime number. (Believing that one has, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: factorized 181 is a logically possible experience, but an internal one, and so, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: also outside the scope of virtual reality.) Another logically impossible, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: experience is unconsciousness, for when one is unconscious one is by, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: definition not experiencing anything. Not experiencing anything is quite, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: different from experiencing a total lack of sensations — sensory isolation —, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: which is of course a physically possible environment., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Having excluded logically impossible experiences and internal experiences,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: we are left with the vast class of logically possible, external experiences —, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: experiences of environments which are logically possible, but may or may, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: not be physically possible (Table 5.1). Something is physically possible if it is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: not forbidden by the laws of physics. In this book I shall assume that the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘laws of physics’ include an as yet unknown rule determining the initial state, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: or other supplementary data necessary to give, in principle, a complete, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: description of the multiverse (otherwise these data would be a set of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: intrinsically inexplicable facts). In that case, an environment is physically, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: possible if and only if it actually exists somewhere in the multiverse (i.e. in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: some universe or universes). Something is physically impossible if it does, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: can be stated like this: what constraints, if any, do the laws of physics, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: image generation — so let us begin there. What constraints do the laws of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: physics impose on the ability of image generators to create artificial images,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: to render detail and to cover their respective sensory ranges? There are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: obvious ways in which the detail rendered by a present-day flight simulator, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: could be improved, for example by using higher-definition televisions. But, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: can a realistic aircraft and its surroundings be rendered, even in principle,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: with the ultimate level of detail — that is, with the greatest level of detail the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: pilot’s senses can resolve? For the sense of hearing, that ultimate level has, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: almost been achieved in hi-fi systems, and for sight it is within reach. But, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: what about the other senses? Is it obvious that it is physically possible to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: build a general-purpose chemical factory that can produce any specified, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: combination of millions of different odoriferous chemicals at a moment’s, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text:   , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: The difficulty of making such machines may be merely technological, but, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: what about this: suppose that the pilot of a flight simulator aims the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: simulated aircraft vertically upwards at high speed and then switches off the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: engines. The aircraft should continue to rise until its upward momentum is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: exhausted, and then begin to fall back with increasing speed. The whole, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: motion is called free fall, even though the aircraft is travelling upwards at, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: first, because it is moving under the influence of gravity alone. When an, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: aircraft is in free fall its occupants are weightless and can float around the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: cabin like astronauts in orbit. Weight is restored only when an upward force, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: is again exerted on the aircraft, as it soon must be, either by aerodynamics, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: or by the unforgiving ground. (In practice free fall is usually achieved by, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: flying the aircraft under power in the same parabolic trajectory that it would, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: follow in the absence of both engine force and air resistance.) Free-falling, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: aircraft are used to give astronauts weightlessness training before they go, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: into space. A real aircraft could be in free fall for a couple of minutes or, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: more, because it has several kilometres in which to go up and down. But a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: flight simulator on the ground can be in free fall only for a moment, while its, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: supports let it ride up to their maximum extension and then drop back. Flight, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: simulators (present-day ones, at least) cannot be used for weightlessness, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: training: one needs real aircraft., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Could one remedy this deficiency in flight simulators by giving them the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: capacity to simulate free fall on the ground (in which case they could also be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: used as spaceflight simulators)? Not easily, for the laws of physics get in the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: way. Known physics provides no way other than free fall, even in principle, of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: removing an object’s weight. The only way of putting a flight simulator into, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: free fall while it remained stationary on the surface of the Earth would be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: somehow to suspend a massive body, such as another planet of similar, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mass, or a black hole, above it. Even if this were possible (remember, we, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: are concerned here not with immediate practicality, but with what the laws of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: physics do or do not permit), a real aircraft could also produce frequent,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: complex changes in the magnitude and direction of the occupants’ weight by, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: manoeuvring or by switching its engines on and off. To simulate these, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: changes, the massive body would have to be moved around just as, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: frequently, and it seems likely that the speed of light (if nothing else) would, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: impose an absolute limit on how fast this could be done., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: However, to simulate free fall a flight simulator would not have to provide, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: real weightlessness, only the experience of weightlessness, and various, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: techniques which do not involve free fall have been used to approximate, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that. For example, astronauts train under water in spacesuits that are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: weighted so as to have zero buoyancy. Another technique is to use a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: harness that carries the astronaut through the air under computer control to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mimic weightlessness. But these methods are crude, and the sensations, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: they produce could hardly be mistaken for the real thing, let alone be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: indistinguishable from it. One is inevitably supported by forces on one’s skin,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: which one cannot help feeling. Also, the characteristic sensation of falling,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: experienced through the sense organs in the inner ear, is not rendered at all., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: One can imagine further improvements: the use of supporting fluids with very, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: low viscosity; drugs that create the sensation of falling. But could one ever, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: render the experience perfectly, in a flight simulator that remained firmly on, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the ground? If not, then there would be an absolute limit on the fidelity with, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: which flying experiences can ever be rendered artificially. To distinguish, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: between a real aircraft and a simulation, a pilot would only have to fly it in a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: free-fall trajectory and see whether weightlessness occurred or not., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Stated generally, the problem is this. To override the normal functioning of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the sense organs, we must send them images resembling those that would, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: be produced by the environment being simulated. We must also intercept, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and suppress the images produced by the user’s actual environment. But, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: these image manipulations are physical operations, and can be performed, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: only by processes available in the real physical world. Light and sound can, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: be physically absorbed and replaced fairly easily. But as I have said, that is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: not true of gravity: the laws of physics do not happen to permit it. The, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: example of weightlessness seems to suggest that accurate simulation of a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: weightless environment by a machine that was not actually in flight might, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: violate the laws of physics., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: But that is not so. Weightlessness and all other sensations can, in principle,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: be rendered artificially. Eventually it will become possible to bypass the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: sense organs altogether and directly stimulate the nerves that lead from, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: them to the brain., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: So, we do not need general-purpose chemical factories or impossible, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: artificial-gravity machines. When we have understood the olfactory organs, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: well enough to crack the code in which they send signals to the brain when, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: they detect scents, a computer with suitable connections to the relevant, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: nerves could send the brain the same signals. Then the brain could, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: experience the scents without the corresponding chemicals ever having, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: existed. Similarly, the brain could experience the authentic sensation of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: weightlessness even under normal gravity. And of course, no televisions or, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: headphones would be needed either., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Thus the laws of physics impose no limit on the range accuracy of image, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: generators. There is no possible sensation, or sequence of sensations, that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: human beings are capable of experiencing that could not in principle be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: rendered artificially. One day, as a generalization of movies, there will be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: what Aldous Huxley in Brave New World called ‘feelies’ — movies for all the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: senses. One will be able to feel the rocking of a boat beneath one’s feet,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: hear the waves and smell the sea, see the changing colours of the sunset on, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the horizon and feel the wind in one’s hair (whether or not one has any hair), Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: — all without leaving dry land or venturing out of doors. Not only that, feelies, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: will just as easily be able to depict scenes that have never existed, and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: never could exist. Or they could play the equivalent of music: beautiful, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: abstract combinations of sensations composed to delight the senses., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: That every possible sensation can be artificially rendered is one thing; that it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: will one day be possible, once and for all, to build a tingle machine that can, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: render any possible sensation calls for something extra: universality. A feelie, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: machine with that capability would be a universal image generator., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: The possibility of a universal image generator forces us to change our, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: perspective on the question of the ultimate limits of feelie technology. At, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: present, progress in such technology is all about inventing more diverse and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: more accurate ways of stimulating sense organs. But that class of problems, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: will disappear once we have cracked the codes used by our sense organs,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and developed a sufficiently delicate technique for stimulating nerves. Once, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: we can artificially generate nerve signals accurately enough for the brain not, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to be able to perceive the difference between those signals and the ones, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that our sense organs would send, increasing the accuracy of this technique, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: will no longer be relevant. At that point the technology will have come of age,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and the challenge for further improvement will be not how to render given, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: sensations, but which sensations to render. In a limited domain this is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: happening today, as the problem of how to get the highest possible fidelity of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: sound reproduction has come close to being solved with the compact disc, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and the present generation of sound-reproduction equipment. Soon there, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: will no longer be such a thing as a hi-fi enthusiast. Enthusiasts for sound, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: reproduction will no longer be concerned with how accurate the reproduction, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: is — it will routinely be accurate to the limit of human discrimination — but, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: only with what sounds should be recorded in the first place., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: If an image generator is playing a recording taken from life, its accuracy may, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: be defined as the closeness of the rendered images to the ones that a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: person in the original situation would have perceived. More generally, if the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: generator is rendering artificially designed images, such as a cartoon, or, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: music played from a written composition, the accuracy is the closeness of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the rendered images to the intended ones. By ‘closeness’ we mean, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: closeness as perceived by the user. If the rendering is so close as to be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: indistinguishable by the user from what is intended, then we can call it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: perfectly accurate. (So a rendering that is perfectly accurate for one user, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: may contain inaccuracies that are perceptible to a user with sharper senses,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: or with additional senses.), Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: A universal image generator does not of course contain recordings of all, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: possible images. What makes it universal is that, given a recording of any, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: possible image, it can evoke the corresponding sensation in the user. With a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: universal auditory sensation generator — the ultimate hi-fi system — the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: recording might be given in the form of a compact disc. To accommodate, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: auditory sensations that last longer than the disc’s storage capacity allows,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: we must incorporate a mechanism that can feed any number of discs, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: consecutively into the machine. The same proviso holds for all other, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: universal image generators, for strictly speaking an image generator is not, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: universal unless it includes a mechanism for playing recordings of unlimited, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: duration. Furthermore, when the machine has been playing for a long time it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: will require maintenance, otherwise the images it generates will become, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: degraded or may cease altogether. These and similar considerations are all, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: connected with the fact that considering a single physical object in isolation, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: from the rest of the universe is always an approximation. A universal image, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: generator is universal only in a certain external context, in which it is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: assumed to be provided with such things as an energy supply, a cooling, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mechanism and periodic maintenance. That a machine has such external, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: needs does not disqualify it from being regarded as a ‘single, universal, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: machine’ provided that the laws of physics do not forbid these needs from, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: being met, and provided that meeting those needs does not necessitate, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: changing the machine’s design., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Now, as I have said, image generation is only one component of virtual, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: reality: there is the all-important interactive element as well. A virtual-reality, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: generator can be thought of as an image generator whose images are not, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: wholly specified in advance but depend partly on what the user chooses to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: do. It does not play its user a predetermined sequence of images, as a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: movie or a feelie would. It composes the images as it goes along, taking into, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: account a continuous stream of information about what the user is doing., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Present-day virtual-reality generators, for instance, keep track of the position, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of the user’s head, using motion sensors as shown in Figure 5.1. Ultimately, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: they will have to keep track of everything the user does that could affect the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: I had better admit here that it is probably too great an idealization to say that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the human mind interacts with the outside world only by emitting and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: receiving nerve impulses. There are chemical messages passing in both, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: be intercepted and replaced at some point between the brain and the rest of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: though such technology lies well in the future, the idea for it is much older, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: From the foregoing discussion it seems that any virtual-reality generator, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: must have at least three principal components:, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:   , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: a set of sensors (which may be nerve-impulse detectors) to detect what the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: a computer in control., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: My account so far has concentrated on the first two of these, the sensors, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and the image generators. That is because, at the present primitive state of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the technology, virtual-reality research is still preoccupied with image, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: generation. But when we look beyond transient technological limitations, we, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: see that image generators merely provide the interface — the ‘connecting, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: cable’ — between the user and the true virtual-reality generator, which is the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: computer. For it is entirely within the computer that the specified, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: environment is simulated. It is the computer that provides the complex and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: autonomous ‘kicking back’ that justifies the word ‘reality’ in ‘virtual reality’., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: The connecting cable contributes nothing to the user’s perceived, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: the nerve signals passing into and out of the human brain, and in cracking, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the various codes involved. But this is a finite set of problems that we shall, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: shift once and for all to the computer, to the problem of programming it to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: render various environments. What environments we shall be able to render, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: will no longer depend on what sensors and image generators we can build,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: but on what environments we can specify. ‘Specifying’ an environment will, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mean supplying a program for the computer, which is the heart of the virtual-, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: reality generator., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Because of the interactive nature of virtual reality, the concept of an accurate, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: rendering is not as straightforward for virtual reality as it is for image, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: generation. As I have said, the accuracy of an image generator is a measure, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of the closeness of the rendered images to the intended ones. But in virtual, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: reality there are usually no particular images intended: what is intended is a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: certain environment for the user to experience. Specifying a virtual-reality, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: environment does not mean specifying what the user will experience, but, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: rather specifying how the environment would respond to each of the user’s, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: possible actions. For example, in a simulated tennis game one may specify, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: in advance the appearance of the court, the weather, the demeanour of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: audience and how well the opponent should play. But one does not specify, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: how the game will go: that depends on the stream of decisions the user, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: makes during the game. Each set of decisions will result in different, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: responses from the simulated environment, and therefore in a different, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: tennis game., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: The number of possible tennis games that can be played in a single, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: environment — that is, rendered by a single program — is very large., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Consider a rendering of the Centre Court at Wimbledon from the point of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: view of a player. Suppose, very conservatively, that in each second of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: game the player can move in one of two perceptibly different ways, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: (perceptibly, that is, to the player). Then after two seconds there are four, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: possible games, after three seconds, eight possible games, and so on. After, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: about four minutes the number of possible games that are perceptibly, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: different from one another exceeds the number of atoms in the universe, and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: it continues to rise exponentially. For a program to render that one, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: environment accurately, it must be capable of responding in any one of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: those myriad, perceptibly different ways, depending on how the player, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: chooses to behave. If two programs respond in the same way to every, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: possible action by the user, then they render the same environment; if they, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: would respond perceptibly differently to even one possible action, they, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: render different environments., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: That remains so even if the user never happens to perform the action that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: shows up the difference. The environment a program renders (for a given, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: type of user, with a given connecting cable) is a logical property of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: program, independent of whether the program is ever executed. A rendered, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: environment is accurate in so far as it would respond in the intended way to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: every possible action of the user. Thus its accuracy depends not only on, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: experiences which users of it actually have, but also on experiences they do, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: not have, but would have had if they had chosen to behave differently during, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the rendering. This may sound paradoxical, but as I have said, it is a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: straightforward consequence of the fact that virtual reality is, like reality itself,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: interactive., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: This gives rise to an important difference between image generation and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: virtual-reality generation. The accuracy of an image generator’s rendering, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: can in principle be experienced, measured and certified by the user, but the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: accuracy of a virtual-reality rendering never can be. For example, if you are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: a music-lover and know a particular piece well enough, you can listen to a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: performance of it and confirm that it is a perfectly accurate rendering, in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: principle down to the last note, phrasing, dynamics and all. But if you are a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: tennis fan who knows Wimbledon’s Centre Court perfectly, you can never, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: confirm that a purported rendering of it is accurate. Even if you are free to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explore the rendered Centre Court for however long you like, and to ‘kick’ it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: in whatever way you like, and even if you have equal access to the real, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Centre Court for comparison, you cannot ever certify that the program does, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: indeed render the real location. For you can never know what would have, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: happened if only you had explored a little more, or looked over your shoulder, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: at the right moment. Perhaps if you had sat on the rendered umpire’s chair, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and shouted ‘fault!’, a nuclear submarine would have surfaced through the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: grass and torpedoed the Scoreboard., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: On the other hand, if you find even one difference between the rendering, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and the intended environment, you can immediately certify that the rendering, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: is inaccurate. Unless, that is, the rendered environment has some, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: intentionally unpredictable features. For example, a roulette wheel is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: designed to be unpredictable. If we make a film of roulette being played in a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: casino, that film may be laid to be accurate if the numbers that are shown, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: coming up in the film are the same numbers that actually came up when the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: film was made. The film will show the same numbers every time it is played:, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: it is totally predictable. So an accurate image of an unpredictable, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: environment must be predictable. But what does it mean for a virtual-reality, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: rendering of a roulette wheel to be accurate? As before, it means that a user, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: should not find it perceptibly different from the original. But this implies that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the rendering must not behave identically to the original: if it did, either it or, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the original could be used to predict the other’s behaviour, and then neither, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: would be unpredictable. Nor must it behave in the same way every time it is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: run. A perfectly rendered roulette wheel must be just as usable for gambling, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: as a real one. Therefore it must be just as unpredictable. Also, it must be just, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: as fair; that is, all the numbers must come up purely randomly, with equal, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: probabilities., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: How do we recognize unpredictable environments, and how do we confirm, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that purportedly random numbers are distributed fairly? We check whether a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: rendering of a roulette wheel meets its specifications in the same way that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: we check whether the real thing does: by kicking (spinning) it, and seeing, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: whether it responds as advertised. We make a large number of similar, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: observations and perform statistical tests on the outcomes. Again, however, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: many tests we carry out, we cannot certify that the rendering is accurate, or, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: even that it is probably accurate. For however randomly the numbers seem, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to come up, they may nevertheless fall into a secret pattern that would allow, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: a user in the know to predict them. Or perhaps if we had asked out loud the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: date of the battle of Waterloo, the next two numbers that came up would, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: invariably show that date: 18, 15. On the other hand, if the sequence that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: comes up looks unfair, we cannot know for sure that it is, but we might be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: able to say that the rendering is probably inaccurate. For example, if zero, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: came up on our rendered roulette wheel on ten consecutive spins, we, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: should conclude that we probably do not have an accurate rendering of a fair, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: roulette wheel., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: When discussing image generators, I said that the accuracy of a rendered, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: image depends on the sharpness and other attributes of the user’s senses., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: With virtual reality that is the least of our problems. Certainly, a virtual-reality, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: generator that renders a given environment perfectly for humans will not do, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: so for dolphins or extraterrestrials. To render a given environment for a user, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: with given types of sense organs, a virtual-reality generator must be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: physically adapted to such sense organs and its computer must be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: programmed with their characteristics. However, the modifications that have, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to be made to accommodate a given species of user are finite, and need, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: only be carried out once. They amount to what I have called constructing a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: new ‘connecting cable’. As we consider environments of ever greater, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: complexity, the task of rendering environments for a given type of user, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: becomes dominated by writing the programs for calculating what those, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: environments will do; the species-specific part of the task, being of fixed, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: complexity, becomes negligible by comparison. This discussion is about the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ultimate limits of virtual reality, so we are considering arbitrarily accurate,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: long and complex renderings. That is why it makes sense to speak of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘rendering a given environment’ without specifying who it is being rendered, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: for., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: We have seen that there is a well-defined notion of the accuracy of a virtual-, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: reality rendering: accuracy is the closeness, as far as is perceptible, of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: rendered environment to the intended one. But it must be close for every, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: possible way in which the user might behave, and that is why, no matter how, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: observant one is when experiencing a rendered environment, one cannot, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: certify that it is accurate (or probably accurate). But experience can, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: sometimes show that a rendering is inaccurate (or probably inaccurate)., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: This discussion of accuracy in virtual reality mirrors the relationship between, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theory and experiment in science. There too, it is possible to confirm, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: experimentally that a general theory is false, but never that it is true. And, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: there too, a short-sighted view of science is that it is all about predicting our, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: sense-impressions. The correct view is that, while sense-impressions always, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: play a role, what science is about is understanding the whole of reality, of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: which only an infinitesimal proportion is ever experienced., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: The program in a virtual-reality generator embodies a general, predictive, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theory of the behaviour of the rendered environment. The other components, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: deal with keeping track of what the user is doing and with the encoding and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: decoding of sensory data; these, as I have said, are relatively trivial, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: functions. Thus if the environment is physically possible, rendering it is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: essentially equivalent to finding rules for predicting the outcome of every, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: experiment that could be performed in that environment. Because of the way, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: in which scientific knowledge is created, ever more accurate predictive rules, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: can be discovered only through ever better explanatory theories. So, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: accurately rendering a physically possible environment depends on, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: understanding its physics., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: The converse is also true: discovering the physics of an environment, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: depends on creating a virtual-reality rendering of it. Normally one would say, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that scientific theories only describe and explain physical objects and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: processes, but do not render them. For example, an explanation of eclipses, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of the Sun can be printed in a book. A computer can be programmed with, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: astronomical data and physical laws to predict an eclipse, and to print out a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: description of it. But rendering the eclipse in virtual reality would require both, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: further programming and further hardware. However, those are already, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: present in our brains! The words and numbers printed by the computer, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: amount to ‘descriptions’ of an eclipse only because someone knows the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: meanings of those symbols. That is, the symbols evoke in the reader’s mind, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: some sort of likeness of some predicted effect of the eclipse, against which, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the real appearance of that effect will be tested. Moreover, the ‘likeness’ that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: is evoked is interactive. One can observe an eclipse in many ways: with the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: naked eye, or by photography, or using various scientific instruments; from, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: some positions on Earth one will see a total eclipse of the Sun, from other, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: positions a partial eclipse, and from anywhere else no eclipse at all. In each, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: case an observer will experience different images, any of which can be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: predicted by the theory. What the computer’s description evokes in a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: reader’s mind is not just a single image or sequence of images, but a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: general method of creating many different images, corresponding to the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: many ways in which the reader may contemplate making observations. In, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: other words, it is a virtual-reality rendering. Thus, in a broad enough sense,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: taking into account the processes that must take place inside the scientist’s, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mind, science and the virtual-reality rendering of physically possible, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: environments are two terms denoting the same activity., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Now, what about the rendering of environments that are not physically, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: possible? On the face of it, there are two distinct types of virtual-reality, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: rendering: a minority that depict physically possible environments, and a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: majority that depict physically impossible environments. But can this, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: distinction survive closer examination? Consider a virtual-reality generator in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the act of rendering a physically impossible environment. It might be a flight, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: simulator, running a program that calculates the view from the cockpit of an, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: aircraft that can fly faster than light. The flight simulator is rendering that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: environment. But in addition the flight simulator is itself the environment that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the user is experiencing, in the sense that it is a physical object surrounding, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the user. Let us consider this environment. Clearly it is a physically possible, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: environment. Is it a renderable environment? Of course. In fact it is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: exceptionally easy to render: one simply uses a second flight simulator of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: same design, running the identical program. Under those circumstances the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: second flight simulator can be thought of as rendering either the physically, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: impossible aircraft, or a physically possible environment, namely the first, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: flight simulator. Similarly, the first flight simulator could be regarded as, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: rendering a physically possible environment, namely the second flight, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: simulator. If we assume that any virtual-reality generator that can in principle, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: be built, can in principle be built again, then it follows that every virtual-reality, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: generator, running any program in its repertoire, is rendering some, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: physically possible environment. It may be rendering other things as well,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: including physically impossible environments, but in particular there is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: always some physically possible environment that it is rendering., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: So, which physically impossible environments can be rendered in virtual, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: reality? Precisely those that are not perceptibly different from physically, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: possible environments. Therefore the connection between the physical world, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and the worlds that are renderable in virtual reality is far closer than it looks., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: We think of some virtual-reality renderings as depicting fact, and others as, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: depicting fiction, but the fiction is always an interpretation in the mind of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: beholder. There is no such thing as a virtual-reality environment that the user, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: would be compelled to interpret as physically impossible., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: We might choose to render an environment as predicted by some ‘laws of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: an exercise, or for fun, or as an approximation because the true rendering is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: too difficult or expensive. If the laws we are using are as close as we can, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: make them to real ones, given the constraints under which we are operating,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: we may call these renderings ‘applied mathematics’ or ‘computing’. If the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: rendered objects are very different from physically possible ones, we may, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: call the rendering ‘pure mathematics’. If a physically impossible environment, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: is rendered for fun, we call it a ‘video game’ or ‘computer art’. All these are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: interpretations. They may be useful interpretations, or even essential in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explaining our motives in composing a particular rendering. But as far as the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: rendering itself goes there is always an alternative interpretation, namely that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: it accurately depicts some physically possible environment., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: It is not customary to think of mathematics as being a form of virtual reality., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: We usually think of mathematics as being about abstract entities, such as, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: numbers and sets, which do not affect the senses; and it might therefore, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: seem that there can be no question of artificially rendering their effect on us., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: However, although mathematical entities do not affect the senses, the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: experience of doing mathematics is an external experience, no less than the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: experience of doing physics is. We make marks on pieces of paper and look, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: at them, or we imagine looking at such marks — indeed, we cannot do, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mathematics without imagining abstract mathematical entities. But this, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: means imagining an environment whose ‘physics’ embodies the complex, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and autonomous properties of those entities. For example, when we imagine, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the abstract concept of a line segment which has no thickness, we may, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: imagine a line that is visible but imperceptibly wide. That much may, just, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: about, be arranged in physical reality. But mathematically the line must, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: continue to have no thickness when we view it under arbitrarily powerful, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: magnification. That is not a property of any physical line, but it can easily be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: achieved in the virtual reality of our imagination., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: Imagination is a straightforward form of virtual reality. What may not be so, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: obvious is that our ‘direct’ experience of the world through our senses is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: virtual reality too. For our external experience is never direct; nor do we even, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: experience the signals in our nerves directly — we would not know what to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: make of the streams of electrical crackles that they carry. What we, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: experience directly is a virtual-reality rendering, conveniently generated for, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: us by our unconscious minds from sensory data plus complex inborn and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: acquired theories (i.e. programs) about how to interpret them., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: We realists take the view that reality is out there: objective, physical and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: independent of what we believe about it. But we never experience that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: reality directly. Every last scrap of our external experience is of virtual reality., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: And every last scrap of our knowledge — including our knowledge of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: non-physical worlds of logic, mathematics and philosophy, and of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: imagination, fiction, art and fantasy — is encoded in the form of programs for, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the rendering of those worlds on our brain’s own virtual-reality generator., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: So it is not just science — reasoning about the physical world — that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: involves virtual reality. All reasoning, all thinking and all external experience, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: are forms of virtual reality. These things are physical processes which so far, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: have been observed in only one place in the universe, namely the vicinity of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the planet Earth. We shall see in Chapter 8 that all living processes involve, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: virtual reality too, but human beings in particular have a special relationship, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: with it. Biologically speaking, the virtual-reality rendering of their environment, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: is the characteristic means by which human beings survive. In other words, it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: is the reason why human beings exist. The ecological niche that human, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: Virtual reality is not just a technology in which computers simulate the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: an important fact about the fabric of reality. It is the basis not only of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text:  , Font: Helvetica-Bold, Size: 15.960000038146973
Text:  The heart of a virtual-reality generator is its computer, and the question of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: what environments can be rendered in virtual reality must eventually come, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: down to the question of what computations can be performed. Even today,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the repertoire of virtual-reality generators is limited as much by their, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: computers as by their image generators. Whenever a new, faster computer,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: with more memory and better image-processing hardware, is incorporated, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: into a virtual-reality generator, the repertoire is enlarged. But will this always, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: be so, or will we eventually encounter full universality, as I have argued we, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: should expect to in the case of image generators? In other words, is there a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: single virtual-reality generator, buildable once and for all, that could be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: programmed to render any environment that the human mind is capable of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: experiencing?, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Just as with image generators, we do not mean by this that it single virtual-, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: reality generator might contain within itself the specifications of all logically, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: possible environments. We mean only that for every logically possible, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: environment it would be possible lo program the generator to render that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: environment. We can envisage encoding the programs on, for example,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: magnetic disks. The more complex the environment, the more disks may be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: needed in store the corresponding program. So to render complex, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: environments the machine must have a mechanism, just as I have described, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: for the universal image generator, that can read unlimited numbers of disks., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Unlike an image generator, a virtual-reality generator may need a growing, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: amount of ‘working memory’ to store the intermediate results of its, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: calculations. We may envisage this as being provided in the form of blank, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: disks. Once again, the fact that a machine needs to be supplied with energy,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: blank disks and maintenance does not prevent us from regarding it as a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘single machine’, provided that these operations are not tantamount to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: changing the machine’s design, and are not forbidden by the laws of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: physics., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: In this sense, then, a computer with an effectively unlimited memory capacity, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: can be envisaged in principle. But a computer with an unlimited speed of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: computation cannot. A computer of given design will always have a fixed, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: maximum speed, which only design changes can increase. Therefore a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: given virtual-reality generator will not be able to perform unlimited amounts, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of computation per unit time. Will this not limit its repertoire? If an, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: environment is so complex that the computation of what the user should be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: seeing one second from now takes the machine more than one second to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: compute, how can the machine possibly render that environment accurately?, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: To achieve universality, we need a further technological trick., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: To extend its repertoire as far as is physically possible, a virtual-reality, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: generator would have to take control of one further attribute of the user’s, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: sensory system, namely the processing speed of the user’s brain. If the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: human brain were like an electronic computer, this would simply be a matter, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of changing the rate at which its ‘clock’ emits synchronizing pulses. No doubt, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the brain’s ‘clock’ will not be so easily controlled. But again this presents no, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: problem of principle. The brain is a finite physical object, and all its functions, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: are physical processes which in principle can be slowed down or stopped., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: The ultimate virtual-reality generator would have to be capable of doing that., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: To achieve a perfect rendering of environments which call for a lot of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: computation, a virtual-reality generator would have to operate in something, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: like the following way. Each sensory nerve is physically capable of relaying, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: signals at a certain maximum rate, because a nerve cell which has fired, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: cannot fire again until about one millisecond later. Therefore, immediately, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: after a particular nerve has fired, the computer has at least one millisecond, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to decide whether, and when, that nerve should fire again. If it has computed, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that decision within, say, half a millisecond, no tampering with the brain’s, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: speed is necessary, and the computer merely fires the nerve at the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: appropriate times. Otherwise, the computer causes the brain slow down (or,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: if necessary, to stop) until the calculation of what should happen next is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: complete; it then restores the brain’s normal speed. What would this feel like, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to the user? By definition, like nothing. The user would experience only the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: environment specified in the program, without any slowing down, stopping or, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: restarting. Fortunately it is never necessary for a virtual-reality generator to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: make the brain operate faster than normal; that would eventually raise, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: problems of principle because, among other things, no signal can travel, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: faster than the speed of light., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: This method allows us to specify in advance an arbitrarily complicated, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: environment whose simulation requires any finite amount of computation,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and to experience that environment at any subjective speed and level of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: detail that our minds are capable of assimilating. If the requisite calculations, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: are too numerous for the computer to perform within the subjectively, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: perceived time, the experience will be unaffected, but the user will pay for its, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: complexity in terms of externally elapsed time. The user might emerge from, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the virtual-reality generator after what seemed subjectively like a five-minute, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: experience, to find that years had passed in physical reality., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: A user whose brain is switched off, for however long, and then switched on, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: again will have an uninterrupted experience of some environment. But a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: user whose brain is switched off for ever has no experiences at all from that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: moment on. This means that a program which might at some point switch, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the user’s brain off, and never switch it on again, does not generate an, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: environment for the user to experience and therefore does not qualify as a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: valid program for a virtual-reality generator. But a program which, eventually,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: always switches the user’s brain back on causes the virtual-reality generator, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to render some environment. Even a program which emits no nerve signals, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: at all renders the dark, silent environment of perfect sensory isolation., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: In our search for the ultimate in virtual-reality we have strayed a very long, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: way from what is feasible today, or even from what is on any foreseeable, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: technological horizon. So let me stress again that for our present purposes, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: technological obstacles are irrelevant. We are not investigating what sorts of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: virtual-reality generator can be built, or even, necessarily, what sorts of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: virtual-reality generator will ever be built, by human engineers. We are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: investigating what the laws of physics do and do not allow in the way of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: virtual reality. The reason why this is important has nothing to do with the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: prospects for making better virtual-reality generators. It is that the relation, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ship between virtual reality and ‘ordinary’ reality is part of the deep,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: unexpected structure of the world, which this book is about., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: By considering various tricks — nerve stimulation, stopping and starting the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: brain, and so on — we have managed to envisage a physically possible, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: virtual-reality generator whose repertoire covers the entire sensory range, is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: fully interactive, and is not constrained by the speed or memory capacity of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: its computer. Is there anything outside the repertoire of such a virtual-reality, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: generator? Would its repertoire be the set of all logically possible, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: environments? It would not. Even this futuristic machine’s repertoire is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: drastically circumscribed by the mere fact of its being a physical object. It, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: does not even scratch the surface of what is logically possible, as I shall now, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: show., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: The basic idea of the proof — known as a diagonal argument — predates, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the idea of virtual reality. It was first used by the nineteenth-century, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mathematician Georg Cantor to prove that there are infinite quantities, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: greater than the infinity of natural number (1, 2, 3…). The same form of proof, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: is at the heart of the modern theory of computation developed by Alan, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Turing and others in the 1930s. It was also used by Kurt Gödel to prove his, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: celebrated ‘incompleteness theorem’, of which more in Chapter 10., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Each environment in our machine’s repertoire is generated by some program, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: for its computer. Imagine the set of all valid programs for this computer., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: From a physical point of view, each such program specifies a particular set, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of values for physical variables, on the disks or other media, that represent, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the computer’s program. We know from quantum theory that all such, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: variables are quantized, and therefore that, no matter how the computer, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: works, the set of possible programs is discrete. Each program can therefore, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: be expressed as a finite sequence of symbols in a discrete code or computer, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: language. There are infinitely many such programs, but each one can, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: contain only a finite number of symbols. That is because symbols are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: physical objects, made of matter in recognizable configurations, and one, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: could not manufacture an infinite number of them. As I shall explain in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Chapter 10, these intuitively obvious physical requirements — that the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: programs must be quantized, and that each of them must consist of a finite, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: number of symbols and can be executed in a sequence of steps — are more, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: substantive than they seem. They are the only consequences of the laws of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: physics that are needed as input for the proof, but they are enough to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: impose drastic restrictions on the repertoire of any physically possible, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: machine. Other physical laws may impose even more restrictions, but they, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: would not affect the conclusions of this chapter., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Now let us imagine this infinite set of possible programs arranged in an, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: infinitely long list, and numbered Program 1, Program 2, and on. They could,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: for instance, be arranged in ‘alphabetical’ order with respect to the symbols, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: in which they are expressed. Because each program generates an, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: environment, this list can also be regarded as a list of all the environments in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the machine’s repertoire; we may call them Environment 1, Environment 2,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and so on. It could be that some of the environments are repeated in the list,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: because two different programs might in effect perform the same, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: calculations, but that will not affect the argument. What is important is that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: each environment in our machine’s repertoire should appear at least once in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the list., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: A simulated environment may be limited or unlimited in apparent physical, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: size and apparent duration. An architect’s simulation of a house, for, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: example, can be run for an unlimited time, but will probably cover only a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: limited volume. A video game might allow the user only a finite time for play, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: before the game ends, or it might render a game-universe of unlimited size,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: allow an unlimited amount of exploration and end only when the user, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: deliberately ends it. To make the proof simpler, let us consider only, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: programs that continue to run for ever. That is not much of a restriction,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: because if a program halts we can always choose to regard its lack of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: response as being the response of a sensory-isolation environment., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Let me define a class of logically possible environments which I shall call, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Cantgotu environments, partly in honour of Cantor, Gödel and Turing, and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: partly for a reason I shall explain shortly. They are defined as follows. For, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the first subjective minute, a Cantgotu environment behaves differently from, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Environment 1 (generated by Program 1 of our generator). It does not matter, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: how it does behave, so long as it is, to the user, recognizably different from, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Environment 1. During the second minute it behaves differently from, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Environment 2 (though it is now allowed to resemble Environment 1 again)., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: During the third minute, it behaves differently from Environment 3, and so, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: on. Any environment that satisfied these rules I shall call a Cantgotu, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: environment., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: Now, since a Cantgotu environment does not behave exactly like, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Environment 1, it cannot be Environment 1; since it does not behave exactly, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: like Environment 2, it cannot be Environment 2. Since it is guaranteed, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: sooner or later to behave differently from Environment 3, Environment 4 and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: every other environment on the list, it cannot be any of those either. But that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: list contains all the environments that are generated by every possible, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: program for this machine. It follows that none of the Cantgotu environments, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: are in the machine’s repertoire. The Cantgotu environments are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: environments that we can’t go to using this virtual-reality generator., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Clearly there are enormously many Cantgotu environments, because the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: definition leaves enormous freedom in choosing how they should behave,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the only constraint being that during each minute they should not behave in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: one particular way. It can be proved that, for every environment in the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: repertoire of a given virtual-reality generator, there are infinitely many, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Cantgotu environments that it cannot render. Nor is there much scope for, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: extending the repertoire by using a range of different virtual-reality, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: generators. Suppose that we had a hundred of them, each (for the sake of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: argument) with a different repertoire. Then the whole collection, combined, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: with the programmable control system that determines which of them shall, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: be used to run a given program, is just a larger virtual-reality generator. That, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: generator is subject to the argument I have given, so for every environment, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: it can render there will be infinitely many that it cannot. Furthermore, the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: assumption that different virtual-reality generators might have different, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: repertoires turns out to be over-optimistic. As we shall see in a moment, all, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: sufficiently sophisticated virtual-reality generators have essentially the same, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: repertoire., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Thus our hypothetical project of building the ultimate virtual-reality generator,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: which had been going so well, has suddenly run into a brick wall. Whatever, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: improvements may be made in the distant future, the repertoire of the entire, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: technology of virtual reality will never grow beyond a certain fixed set of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: environments. Admittedly this set is infinitely large, and very diverse by, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: comparison with human experience prior to virtual-reality technology., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Nevertheless, it is only an infinitesimal fraction of the set of all logically, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: possible environments., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: What would it feel like to be in a Cantgotu environment? Although the laws, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of physics do not permit us to be in one, it is still logically possible and so it is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: legitimate to ask what it would feel like. Certainly, it could give us no new, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: sensations, because a universal image generator is possible and is assumed, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to be part of our high-technology virtual-reality generator. So a Cantgotu, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: environment would seem mysterious to us only after we had experienced it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and reflected on the results. It would go something like this. Suppose you, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: are a virtual-reality buff in the distant, ultra-high-techhnology future. You, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: have become jaded, for it seems to you that you have already tried, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: everything interesting. But then one day a genie appears and claims to be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: able to transport you to a Cantgotu environment. You are sceptical, but, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: agree to put its claim to the test. You are whisked away to the environment., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: After a few expedients you seem to recognize it — it responds just like one, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of your favourite environments, which on your home virtual-reality system, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: has program number X. However, you keep experimenting, and eventually,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: during the Xth subjective minute of the experience, the environment, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: responds in a way that is markedly different from anything that Environment, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: X would do. So you give up the idea that this is Environment X. You may, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: then notice that everything that has happened so far is also consistent with, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: another renderable environment, Environment Y. But then, during the Yth, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: subjective minute you are proved wrong again. The characteristic of a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Cantgotu environment is simply this: no matter how often you guess, no, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: matter how complex a program you contemplate as being the one that might, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: be rendering the environment, you will always be proved wrong because no, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: program will render it, on your virtual reality generator or on any other., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Sooner or later you will have to bring the test to a close. At that point you, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: may well decide to concede the genie’s claim. That is nor to say that you, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: could ever prove that you had been in a Cantgotu environment, for there is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: always an even more complex program that the genie might have been, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: running, which would match your experiences so far. That is just the general, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: feature of virtual reality that I have already discussed, namely that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: experience cannot prove that one is in a given environment, be it the Centre, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Court at Wimbledon or an environment of the Cantgotu type., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Anyway, there are no such genies, and no such environments. So we must, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: conclude that physics does not allow the repertoire of a virtual-reality, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: generator to be anywhere near as large as logic alone would allow. How, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: large can it be?, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Since we cannot hope to render all logically possible environments, let us, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: consider a weaker (but ultimately more interesting) sort of universality. Let us, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: define a universal virtual-reality generator as one whose repertoire contains, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that of every other physically possible virtual-reality generator. Can such a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: machine exist? It can. Thinking about futuristic devices based on computer-, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: controlled nerve stimulation makes this obvious — in fact, almost too, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: obvious. Such a machine could be programmed to have the characteristics, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of any rival machine. It could calculate how that machine would respond,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: under any given program, to any behaviour by the user, and so could render, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: those responses with perfect accuracy (from the point of view of any given, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: user). I say that this is ‘almost too obvious’ because it contains an important, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: assumption about what the proposed device, and more specifically its, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: computer, could be programmed to do: given the appropriate program, and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: enough time and storage media, it could calculate the output of any, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: computation performed by any other computer, including the one in the rival, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: virtual-reality generator. Thus the feasibility of a universal virtual-reality, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: generator depends on the existence of a universal computer — a single, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: machine that can calculate anything that can be calculated., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: As I have said, this sort of universality was first studied not by physicists but, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: by mathematicians. They were trying to make precise the intuitive notion of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘computing’ (or ‘calculating’ or ‘proving’) something in mathematics. They did, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: not take on board the fact that mathematical calculation is a physical, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: process (in particular, as I have explained, it is a virtual-reality rendering, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: process), so it is impossible to determine by mathematical reasoning what, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: can or cannot be calculated mathematically. That depends entirely on the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: laws of physics. But instead of trying to deduce their results from physical, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: laws, mathematicians postulated abstract models of ‘computation’, and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: defined ‘calculation’ and ‘proof’ in terms of those models. (I shall discuss this, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: interesting mistake in Chapter 10.) That is how it came about that over a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: period of a few months in 1936, three mathematicians, Emil Post, Alonzo, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Church and, most importantly, Alan Turing, independently created the first, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: abstract designs for universal computers. Each of them conjectured that his, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: model of ‘computation’ did indeed correctly formalize the traditional, intuitive, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: notion of mathematical ‘computation’. Consequently, each of them also, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: conjectured that his model was equivalent to (had the same repertoire as), Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: any other reasonable formalization of the same intuition. This is now known, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: as the Church-Turing conjecture., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Turing’s model of computation, and his conception of the nature of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: problem he was solving, was the closest to being physical. His abstract, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: computer, the Turing machine, was abstracted from the idea of a paper tape, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: divided into squares, with one of a finite number of easily distinguishable, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: symbols written on each square. Computation was performed by examining, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: one square at a time moving the tape backwards or forwards, and erasing or, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: writing one of the symbols according to simple, unambiguous rules. Turing, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: proved that one particular computer of this type, the universal Turing, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: machine, had the combined repertoire of all other Turing machines. He, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: conjectured that this repertoire consisted precisely of ‘every function that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: would naturally be regarded as computable’. He meant computable by, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mathematicians., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: But mathematicians are rather untypical physical objects. Why should we, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: assume that rendering them in the act of performing calculations is the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ultimate in computational tasks? It turns out that it is not. As I shall explain in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Chapter 9, quantum computers can perform computations of which no, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: (human) mathematician will ever, even in principle, be capable. It is implicit, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: in Turing’s work that he expected what ‘would naturally be regarded as, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: computable’ to be also what could, at least in principle, be computed in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: nature. This expectation is tantamount to a stronger, physical version of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Church-Turing conjecture. The mathematician Roger Penrose has, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: suggested that it should be called the Turing principle:, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: computation that any physically possible object can perform.  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Turing believed that the ‘universal computer’ in question was the universal, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Turing machine. To take account of the wider repertoire of quantum, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: computers, I have stated the principle in a form that does not specify which, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: particular ‘abstract computer’ does the job. The proof I have given of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: existence of Cantgotu environments is essentially due to Turing. As I said,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: he was not thinking explicitly in terms of virtual reality, but an ‘environment, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that can be rendered’ does correspond to a class of mathematical questions, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: whose answers can be calculated. Those questions are computable. The, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: remainder, the questions for which there is no way of calculating the answer,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: are called non-computable. If a question is non-computable that does not, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mean that it has no answer, or that its answer is in any sense ill-defined or, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ambiguous. On the contrary, it means that it definitely has an answer. It is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: just that physically there is no way, even in principle, of obtaining that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: answer (or more precisely, since one could always make a lucky,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: unverifiable guess, of proving that it is the answer). For example, a prime, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: pair is a pair of prime numbers whose difference is 2, such as 3 and 5, or 11, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and 13. Mathematicians have tried in vain to answer the question whether, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: there are infinitely many such pairs, or only a finite number of them. It is not, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: even known whether this question is computable. Let us suppose that it is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: not. That is to say that no one, and no computer, can ever produce a proof, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: either that there are only finitely many prime pairs or that there are infinitely, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: many. Even so, the question does have an answer: one can say with, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: certainty that either there is a highest prime pair or there are infinitely many, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: prime pairs; there is no third possibility. The question remains well-defined,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: even though we may never know the answer., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: In virtual-reality terms: no physically possible virtual-reality generator can, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: render an environment in which answers to non-computable questions are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: provided to the user on demand. Such environments are of the Cantgotu, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: type. And conversely, every Cantgotu environment corresponds to a class of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mathematical questions (‘what would happen next in an environment defined, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: in such-and-such a way?’) which it is physically impossible to answer., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Although non-computable questions are infinitely more numerous than, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: computable ones, they tend to be more esoteric. That is no accident. It is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: because the parts of mathematics that we tend to consider the least esoteric, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: are those we see reflected in the behaviour of physical objects in familiar, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: situations. In such cases we can often use those physical objects to answer, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: questions about the corresponding mathematical relationships. For example,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: we can count on our fingers because the physics of fingers naturally mimics, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the arithmetic of the whole numbers from zero to ten., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: The repertoires of the three very different abstract computers defined by, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Turing, Church and Post were soon proved to be identical. So have the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: repertoires of all abstract models of mathematical computation that have, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: since been proposed. This is deemed to lend support to the Church-Turing, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: conjecture and to the universality of the universal Turing machine. However,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the computing power of abstract machines has no bearing on what is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: computable in reality. The scope of virtual reality, and its wider implications, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: for the comprehensibility of nature and other aspects of the fabric of reality,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: depends on whether the relevant computers are physically realizable. In, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: realizable. This leads to a stronger version of the Turing principle:, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: physical object, buildable once and for all (apart from maintenance and a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: This is just the sort of self-similarity that is necessary if, according to the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: hope I expressed in Chapter 1, the fabric of reality is to be truly unified and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: comprehensible. If the laws of physics as they apply to any physical object or, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: process are to be comprehensible, they must be capable of being embodied, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: in another physical object — the knower. It is also necessary that processes, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: capable of creating such knowledge be physically possible. Such processes, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: are called science. Science depends on experimental testing, which means, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: physically rendering a law’s predictions and comparing it with (a rendering, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of) reality. It also depends on explanation, and that requires the abstract, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: laws themselves, not merely their predictive content, to be capable of being, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: rendered in virtual reality. This is a tall order, but reality does meet it. That is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to say, the laws of physics meet it. The laws of physics, by conforming to the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Turing principle, make it physically possible for those same laws to become, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: known to physical objects. Thus, the laws of physics may be said to mandate, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: their own comprehensibility., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Since building a universal virtual-reality generator is physically possible, it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: must actually be built in some universes. A caveat is necessary here. As I, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explained in Chapter 3, we can normally define physically possible process, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: as one that actually occurs somewhere in the multiverse. But strictly, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: speaking, a universal virtual-reality generator is a limiting case that requires, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: arbitrarily large resources to operate. So what we really mean by saying that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: it is ‘physically possible’ is that virtual-reality generators with repertoires, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: arbitrarily close to the set of all physically possible environments exist in the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: multiverse. Similarly, since the laws of physics are capable of being, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: rendered, they are rendered somewhere. Thus it follows from the Turing, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: principle (in the strong form for which I have argued) that the laws of physics, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: do not merely mandate their own comprehensibility in some abstract sense, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: — comprehensibility by abstract scientists, as it were. They imply the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: physical existence, somewhere in the multiverse, of entities that understand, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: them arbitrarily well. I shall discuss this implication further in later chapters., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Now I return to the question I posed in the previous chapter, namely, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: whether, if we had only a virtual-reality rendering based on the wrong laws of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: physics to learn from, we should expect to learn the wrong laws. The first, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: thing to stress is that we do have only virtual reality based on the wrong laws, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to learn from! As I have said, all our external experiences are of virtual, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: reality, generated by our own brains. And since our concepts and theories, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: (whether inborn or learned) are never perfect, all our renderings are indeed, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: inaccurate. That is to say, they give us the experience of an environment, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that is significantly different from the environment that we are really in., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Mirages and other optical illusions are examples of this. Another is that we, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: We are embarked upon solving problems about physical reality. If it turns out, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that all this time we have merely been studying the programming of a cosmic, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: planetarium, then that would merely mean that we have been studying a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: smaller portion of reality than we thought. So what? Such things have, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: happened many times in the history of science, as our horizons have, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: expanded beyond the Earth to include the solar system, our Galaxy, other, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: galaxies, clusters of galaxies and so on, and, of course, parallel universes., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Another such broadening may happen tomorrow; indeed, it may happen, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: according to any one of an infinity of possible theories — or it may never, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: happen. Logically, we must concede to solipsism and related doctrines that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the reality we are learning about might be an unrepresentative portion of a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: larger, inaccessible or incomprehensible structure. But the general refutation, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that I have given of such doctrines shows us that it is irrational to build upon, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: that possibility. Following Occam, we shall entertain such theories when, and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: only when, they provide better explanations than simpler rival theories., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: However, there is a question we can still ask. Suppose that someone were, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: imprisoned in a small, unrepresentative portion of our own reality — for, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: instance, inside a universal virtual-reality generator that was programmed, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: with the wrong laws of physics. What could such prisoners learn about our, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: external reality? At first sight, it seems impossible that they could discover, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: anything at all about it. It may deem that the most they could discover would, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: be the laws of operation, i.e. the program, of the computer that operated, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: their prison., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: But that is not so! Again, we must bear in mind that if the prisoners are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: scientists, they will be seeking explanations as well as predictions. In other, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: words, they will not be content with merely knowing the program that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: operates their prison: they will want to explain the origin and attributes of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: various entities, including themselves, that they observe in the reality they, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: inhabit. But in most virtual-reality environments no such explanation exists,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: for the rendered objects do not originate there but have been designed in the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: external reality. Suppose that you are playing a virtual-reality video game., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: For the sake of simplicity, suppose that the game is essentially chess (a first-, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: person-perspective version perhaps, in which you adopt the persona of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: king). You will use the normal methods of science to discover this, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: environment’s ‘laws of physics’ and their emergent consequences. You will, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: learn that checkmate and stalemate are ‘physically’ possible events (i.e., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: possible under your best understanding of how the environment works), but, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that a position with nine white pawns is not ‘physically’ possible. Once you, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: had understood the laws sufficiently well, you would notice that the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: chessboard is too simple an object to have, for instance, thoughts, and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: consequently that your own thought-processes can not be governed by the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: laws of chess alone. Similarly, you could tell that during any number of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: games of chess the pieces can never evolve into self-reproducing, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: configurations. And if life cannot evolve on the chessboard, far less can, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: intelligence evolve. Therefore you would also infer that your own thought-, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: processes could not have originated in the universe in which you found, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: yourself. So even if you had lived within the rendered environment all your, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: life, and did not have your own memories of the outside world to account for, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: as well, your knowledge would not be confined to that environment. You, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: would know that, even though the universe seemed to have a certain layout, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and obey certain laws, there must be a wider universe outside it, obeying, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: different laws of physics. And you could even guess some of the ways in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: which these wider laws would have to differ from the chessboard laws., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: Arthur C. Clarke once remarked that ‘any sufficiently advanced technology is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: indistinguishable from magic’. This is true, but slightly misleading. It is stated, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: from the point of view of a pre-scientific thinker, which is the wrong way, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: round. The fact is that to anyone who understands what virtual reality is,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: even genuine magic would be indistinguishable from technology, for there is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: no room for magic in a comprehensible reality. Anything that seems, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: incomprehensible is regarded by science merely as evidence that there is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: Reasoning from the premise of one’s own existence is called ‘anthropic’, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: reasoning. Although it has some applicability in cosmology, it usually has to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: be supplemented by substantive assumptions about the nature of ‘oneself’, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: before it yields definite conclusions. But anthropic reasoning is not the only, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: way in which the inmates of our hypothetical virtual-reality prison could gain, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: knowledge of an outside world. Any of their evolving explanations of their, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: narrow world could, at the drop of a hat, reach into an outside reality. For, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: instance, the very rules of chess contain what a thoughtful player may, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: realize is ‘fossil evidence’ of those rules having had an evolutionary history:, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: there are ‘exceptional’ moves such as castling and capturing en passant, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: which increase the complexity of the rules but improve the game. In, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explaining that complexity, one justifiably concludes that the rules of chess, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: were not always as they are now., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: In the Popperian scheme of things, explanations always lead to new, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: problems which in turn require further explanations. If the prisoners fail, after, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: a while, to improve upon their existing explanations, they may of course give, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: up, perhaps falsely concluding that there are no explanations available. But, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: if they do not give up they will be thinking about those aspects of their, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: environment that seem inadequately explained. Thus if the high-technology, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: jailers wanted to be confident that their rendered environment would forever, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: fool their prisoners into thinking that there is no outside world, they would, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: have their work cut out for them. The longer they wanted the illusion to last,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the more ingenious the program would have to be. It is not enough that the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: inmates be prevented from observing the outside. The rendered, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: environment would also have to be such that no explanations of anything, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: inside would ever require one to postulate an outside. The environment, in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: other words, would have to be self-contained as regards explanations. But I, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: Karl Popper, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  As I explained in the Preface, this book is not primarily a defence of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: fundamental theories of the four main strands; it is an investigation of what, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: those theories say, and what sort of reality they describe. That is why I do, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: not address opposing theories in any depth. However, there is one opposing, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theory — namely, common sense — which reason requires me to refute in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: detail wherever it seems to conflict with what I am asserting. Hence in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Chapter 2 I presented a root-and-branch refutation of the common-sense, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: idea that there is only one universe. In Chapter 11 I shall do the same for the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: common-sense idea that time ‘flows’, or that our consciousness ‘moves’, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: through time. In Chapter 3 I criticized inductivism, the common-sense idea, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that we form theories about the physical world by generalizing the results of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: observations, and that we justify our theories by repeating those, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: observations. I explained that inductive generalization from observations is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: impossible, and that inductive justification is invalid. I explained that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: inductivism rests upon a mistaken idea of science as seeking predictions on, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the basis of observations, rather than as seeking explanations in response to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: problems. I also explained (following Popper) how science does make, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: progress, by conjecturing new explanations and then choosing between the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: best ones by experiment. All this is largely accepted by scientists and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: philosophers of science. What is not accepted by most philosophers is that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: this process is justified. Let me explain., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Science seeks better explanations. A scientific explanation accounts for our, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: observations by postulating something about what reality is like and how it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: works. We deem an explanation to be better if it leaves fewer loose ends, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: (such as entities whose properties are themselves unexplained), requires, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: fewer and simpler postulates, is more general, meshes more easily with, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: good explanations in other fields and so on. But why should a better, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explanation be what we always assume it to be in practice, namely the token, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of a truer theory? Why, for that matter, should a downright bad explanation, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: (one that has none of the above attributes, say) necessarily be false? There, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: is indeed no logically necessary connection between truth and explanatory, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: power. A bad explanation (such as solipsism) may be true. Even the best, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and truest available theory may make a false prediction in particular cases,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and those might be the very cases in which we rely on the theory. No valid, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: form of reasoning can logically rule out such possibilities, or even prove, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: them unlikely. But in that case, what justifies our relying on our best, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explanations as guides to practical decision-making? More generally,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: whatever criteria we used to judge scientific theories, how could the fact that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: a theory satisfied those criteria today possibly imply anything about what will, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: happen if we rely on the theory tomorrow?, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: This is the modern form of the ‘problem of induction’. Most philosophers are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: now content with Popper’s contention that new theories are not inferred from, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: anything, but are merely hypotheses. They also accept that scientific, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: progress is made through conjectures and refutations (as described in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Chapter 3), and that theories are accepted when all their rivals are refuted,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and not by virtue of numerous confirming instances. They accept that the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: knowledge obtained in this way tends, in the event, to be reliable. The, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: problem is that they do not see why it should be. Traditional inductivists tried, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to formulate a ‘principle of induction’, which said that confirming instances, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: made a theory more likely, or that ‘the future will resemble the past’, or some, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: such statement. They also tried to formulate an inductive scientific, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: methodology, laying down rules for what sort of inferences one could validly, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: draw from ‘data’. They all failed, for the reasons I have explained. But even if, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: they had succeeded, in the sense of constructing a scheme that could be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: followed successfully to create scientific knowledge, this would not have, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: solved the problem of induction as it is nowadays understood. For in that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: case ‘induction’ would simply be another possible way of choosing theories,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and the problem would remain of why those theories should be a reliable, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: basis for action. In other words, philosophers who worry about this ‘problem, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of induction’ are not inductivists in the old-fashioned sense. They do not try, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to obtain or justify any theories inductively. They do not expect the sky to fall, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: in, but they do not know how to justify that expectation., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Philosophers today yearn for this missing justification. They no longer, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: believe that induction would provide it, yet they have an induction-shaped, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: gap in their scheme of things, just as religious people who have lost their, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: faith suffer from a ‘God-shaped gap’ in their scheme of things. But in my, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: opinion there is little difference between having an X-shaped gap in one’s, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: scheme of things and believing in X. Hence to fit in with the more, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: sophisticated conception of the problem of induction, I wish to redefine the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: term ‘inductivist’ to mean someone who believes that the invalidity of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: inductive justification is a problem for the foundations of science. In other, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: words, an inductivist believes that there is a gap which must be filled, if not, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: by a principle of induction then by something else. Some inductivists do not, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mind being so designated. Others do, so I shall call them crypto-inductivists., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Most contemporary philosophers are crypto-inductivists. What makes, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: matters worse is that (like many scientists) they grossly underrate the role of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explanation in the scientific process. So do most Popperian anti-inductivists,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: who are thereby led to deny that there is any such thing as justification (even, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: tentative justification). This opens up a new explanatory gap in their scheme, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of things. The philosopher John Worrall has dramatized the problem as he, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: sees it in an imaginary dialogue between Popper and several other, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: philosophers, entitled ‘Why Both Popper and Watkins Fail to Solve the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Problem of Induction’.[1] The setting is the top of the Eiffel Tower. One of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: participants — the ‘Floater’ — decides to descend by jumping over the side, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: instead of using the lift in the usual way. The others try to persuade the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Floater that jumping off means certain death. They use the best available, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: scientific and philosophical arguments. But the infuriating Floater still expects, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to float down safely, and keeps pointing out that no rival expectation can, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: logically be proved to be preferable on the basis of past experience., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: I believe that we can justify our expectation that the Floater would be killed., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: The justification (always tentative, of course) comes from the explanations, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: provided by the relevant scientific theories. To the extent that those, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: explanations are good, it is rationally justified to rely on the predictions of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: corresponding theories. So, in reply to Worrall, I now present a dialogue of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: CRYPTO-INDUCTIVIST: Because Popper never addressed the problem of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: induction as we understand it. What he did was present a critique of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: inductivism. Inductivism said that there is an ‘inductive’ form of reasoning, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: which can derive, and justify the use of, general theories about the future,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: given evidence in the form of individual observations made in the past. It, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: held that there was a principle of nature, the principle of induction, which, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: said something like ‘observations made in the future are likely to resemble, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: observations made under similar circumstances in the past’. Attempts were, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: made to formulate this in such a way that it would indeed allow one to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: derive, or justify, general theories from individual observations. They all, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: failed. Popper’s critique, though influential among scientists (especially in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: was hardly original. The unsoundness of inductivism had been known almost, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: since it was invented, and certainly since David Hume’s critique of it in the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: early eighteenth century. The problem of induction is not how to justify or, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: DAVID: Yes, I would consider it justified to rely on that theory. According to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Popperian methodology, one should in these cases rely on the best-, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: corroborated theory — that is, the one that has been subjected to the most, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: CRYPTO-INDUCTIVIST: You say ‘one should’ rely on the best-corroborated, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theory, but why, exactly? Presumably because, according to Popper, the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: process of corroboration has justified the theory, in the sense that its, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: predictions are more likely to be true than the predictions of other theories., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: DAVID: Well, not more likely than all other theories, because no doubt one, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: CRYPTO-INDUCTIVIST: Now look. Please let’s agree not to trip each other, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: up with quibbles that do not bear on the substance of what we are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: discussing. Of course there may be a better theory of gravity one day, but, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: you have to decide whether to jump now, now. And given the evidence, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: available to you now, you have chosen a certain theory to act upon. And you, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: have chosen it according to Popperian criteria because you believe that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: those criteria are the ones most likely to select theories which make true, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: predictions., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: DAVID: Yes., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: CRYPTO-INDUCTIVIST: So to summarize, you believe that the evidence, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: currently available to you justifies the prediction that you would be killed if, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: you leapt over the railing., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: DAVID: No, it doesn’t., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: CRYPTO-INDUCTIVIST: But dammit, you are contradicting yourself. Just, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: now you said that that prediction is justified., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: DAVID: It is justified. But it was not justified by the evidence, if by ‘the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: evidence’ you mean all the experiments whose outcomes the theory, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: correctly predicted in the past. As we all know, that evidence is consistent, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: with an infinity of theories, including theories predicting every logically, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: possible outcome of my jumping over the railing., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: CRYPTO-INDUCTIVIST: So in view of that, I repeat, the whole problem is to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: find what does justify the prediction. That is the problem of induction., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: DAVID: Well, that is the problem that Popper solved., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: CRYPTO-INDUCTIVIST: That’s news to me, and I’ve studied Popper, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: extensively. But anyway, what is the solution? I’m eager to hear it. What, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: justifies the prediction, if it isn’t the evidence?, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: DAVID: Argument., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: CRYPTO-INDUCTIVIST: Argument?, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: DAVID: Only argument ever justifies anything — tentatively, of course. All, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theorizing is subject to error, and all that. But still, argument can sometimes, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: justify theories. That is what argument is for., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: CRYPTO-INDUCTIVIST: I think this is another of your quibbles. You can’t, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mean that the theory was justified by pure argument, like a mathematical, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theorem.[2] The evidence played some role, surely., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: DAVID: Of course. This is an empirical theory, so, according to Popperian, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: scientific methodology, crucial experiments play a pivotal role in deciding, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: between it and its rivals. The rivals were refuted; it survived., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: CRYPTO-INDUCTIVIST: And in consequence of that refuting and surviving,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: all of which happened in the past, the practical use of the theory to predict, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the future is now justified., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: DAVID: I suppose so, though it seems misleading to say ‘in consequence of’, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: when we are not talking about a logical deduction., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: CRYPTO-INDUCTIVIST: Well that’s the whole point again: what sort of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: consequence was it? Let me try to pin you down here. You admit that it was, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: both argument and the outcomes of experiments that justified the theory. If, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the experiments had gone differently, the argument would have justified a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: different theory. So do you accept that in that sense — yes, via the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: argument, but I don’t want to keep repeating that proviso — the outcomes of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: past experiments did justify the prediction?, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: DAVID: Yes., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: CRYPTO-INDUCTIVIST: So what exactly was it about those actual past, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: outcomes that justified the prediction, as opposed to other possible past, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: outcomes which might well have justified the contrary prediction?, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: DAVID: It was that the actual outcomes refuted all the rival theories, and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: corroborated the theory that now prevails., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: CRYPTO-INDUCTIVIST: Good. Now listen carefully, because you have just, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: said something which is not only provably untrue, but which you yourself, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: conceded was untrue only moments ago. You say that the outcomes of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: experiments ‘refuted all the rival theories’. But you know very well that no set, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of outcomes of experiments can refute all possible rivals to a general theory., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: You said yourself that any set of past outcomes is (I quote) ‘consistent with, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: an infinity of theories, including theories predicting every logically possible, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: outcome of my jumping over the railing’. It follows inexorably that the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: prediction you favour was not justified by the experimental outcomes,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: because there are infinitely many other rivals to your theory, also unrefuted, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: as yet, which make the opposite prediction., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: DAVID: I’m glad I listened carefully, as you asked, for now I see that at least, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: part of the difference between us has been caused by a misunderstanding, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: over terminology. When Popper speaks of ‘rival theories’ to a given theory,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: he does not mean the set of all logically possible rivals: he means only the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: actual rivals, those proposed in the course of a rational controversy. (That, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: includes theories ‘proposed’ purely mentally, by one person, in the course of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: a ‘controversy’ within one mind.), Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: CRYPTO-INDUCTIVIST: I see. Well, I’ll accept your terminology. But, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: incidentally (I don’t think it matters, for present purposes, but I’m curious),, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: isn’t it a strange assertion you are attributing to Popper, that the reliability of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: a theory depends on the accident of what other theories — false theories —, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: people have proposed in the past, rather than just on the content of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theory in question, and on the experimental evidence?, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: DAVID: Not really. Even you inductivists speak of…, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: CRYPTO-INDUCTIVIST: I am not an inductivist!, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: DAVID: Yes you are., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: CRYPTO-INDUCTIVIST: Hmph! Once again, I shall accept your terminology, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: if you insist. But you may as well call me a porcupine. It really is perverse to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: call a person an ‘inductivist’ if that person’s whole thesis is that the invalidity, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of inductive reasoning presents us with an unsolved philosophical problem., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: DAVID: I don’t think so. I think that that thesis is what defines, and always, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: has defined, an inductivist. But I see that Popper has at least achieved one, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: thing: ‘inductivist’ has become a term of abuse! Anyway, I was explaining, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: why it’s not so strange that the reliability of a theory should depend on what, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: false theories people have proposed in the past. Even inductivists speak of a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theory being reliable or not, given certain ‘evidence’. Well, Popperians might, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: speak of a theory being the best available for use in practice, given a certain, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: problem-situation. And the most important features of a problem-situation, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: are: what theories and explanations are in contention, what arguments have, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: been advanced, and what theories have been refuted. ‘Corroboration’ is not, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: just the confirmation of the winning theory. It requires the experimental, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: refutation of rival theories. Confirming instances in themselves have no, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: significance., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: CRYPTO-INDUCTIVIST: Very interesting. I now understand the role of a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theory’s refuted rivals in the justification of its predictions. Under inductivism,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: observation was supposed to be primary. One imagined a mass of past, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: observations from which the theory was supposed to be induced, and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: observations also constituted the evidence which somehow justified the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theory. In the Popperian picture of scientific progress, it is not observations, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: but problems, controversies, theories and criticism that are primary., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Experiments are designed and performed only to resolve controversies., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Therefore only experimental results that actually do refute a theory — and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: not just any theory, it must have been a genuine contender in a rational, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: controversy — constitute ‘corroboration’. And so it is only those experiments, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that provide evidence for the reliability of the winning theory., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: DAVID: Correct. And even then, the ‘reliability’ that corroboration confers is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: not absolute but only relative to the other contending theories. That is, we, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: expect the strategy of relying on corroborated theories to select the best, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theories from those that are proposed. That is a sufficient basis for action., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: We do not need (and could not validly get) any assurance about how good, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: even the best proposed course of action will be. Furthermore, we may, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: always be mistaken, but so what? We cannot use theories that have yet to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: be proposed; nor can we correct errors that we cannot yet see., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: CRYPTO-INDUCTIVIST: Quite so. I am glad to have learned something, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: about scientific methodology. But now — and I hope you don’t think me, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: impolite — I must draw your attention yet again to the question I have been, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: asking all along. Suppose that a theory has passed through this whole, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: process. Once upon a time it had rivals. Then experiments were performed, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and all the rivals were refuted. But it itself was not refuted. Thus it was, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: corroborated. What is it about its being corroborated that justifies our relying, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: on it in the future!, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: DAVID: Since all its rivals have been refuted, they are no longer rationally, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: tenable. The corroborated theory is the only rationally tenable theory, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: remaining., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: CRYPTO-INDUCTIVIST: But that only shifts the focus from the future import, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of past corroboration to the future import of past refutation. The same, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: problem remains. Why, exactly, is an experimentally refuted theory ‘not, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: rationally tenable’? Is it that having even one false consequence implies that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: it cannot be true?, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: DAVID: Yes., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: CRYPTO-INDUCTIVIST: But surely, as regards the future applicability of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theory, that is not a logically relevant criticism. Admittedly, a refuted theory, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: cannot be true universally[3] — in particular, it cannot have been true in the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: past, when it was tested. But it could still have many true consequences,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and in particular it could be universally true in the future., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: DAVID: This ‘true in the past’ and ‘true in the future’ terminology is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: misleading. Each specific prediction of a theory is either true or false; that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: cannot change. What you really mean is that though the refuted theory is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: strictly false, because it makes some false predictions, all its predictions, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: about the future might nevertheless be true. In other words, a different, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theory, which makes the same predictions about the future but different, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: predictions about the past, might be true., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: CRYPTO-INDUCTIVIST: If you like. So instead of asking why a refuted, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theory is not rationally tenable, I should, strictly speaking, have asked this:, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: why does the refutation of a theory also render untenable every variant of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the theory that agrees with it about the future — even a variant that has not, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: been refuted?, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: DAVID: It is not that refutation renders such theories untenable. It is just that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: sometimes they already are untenable, by virtue of being bad explanations., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: And that is when science can make progress. For a theory to win an, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: argument, all its rivals must be untenable, and that includes all the variants, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of the rivals which anyone has thought of. But remember, it is only the rivals, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: which anyone has thought of that need be untenable. For example, in the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: case of gravity no one has ever proposed a tenable theory that agrees with, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the prevailing one in all its tested predictions, but differs in its predictions, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: about future experiments. I am sure that such theories are possible — for, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: instance, the successor to the prevailing theory will presumably be one of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: them. But if no one has yet thought of such a theory, how can anyone act, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: upon it?, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: CRYPTO-INDUCTIVIST: What do you mean, ‘no one has yet thought of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: such a theory’? I could easily think of one right now., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: DAVID: I very much doubt that you can., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: CRYPTO-INDUCTIVIST: Of course I can. Here it is. ‘Whenever you, David,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: jump from high places in ways that would, according to the prevailing theory,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: kill you, you float instead. Apart from that, the prevailing theory holds, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: universally.’ I put it to you that every past test of your theory was also, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: necessarily a test of mine, since all the predictions of your theory and mine, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: regarding past experiments are identical. Therefore your theory’s refuted, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: rivals were also my theory’s refuted rivals. And therefore my new theory is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: exactly as corroborated as your prevailing theory. How, then, can my theory, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: be ‘untenable’? What faults could it possibly have that are not shared by, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: your theory?, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: DAVID: Just about every fault in the Popperian book! Your theory is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: constructed from the prevailing one by appending an unexplained, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: qualification about me floating. That qualification is, in effect, a new theory,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: but you have given no argument either against the prevailing theory of my, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: gravitational properties, or in favour of the new one. You have subjected, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: your new theory to no criticism (other than what I am giving it now) and no, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: experimental testing. It does not solve — or even purport to solve — any, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: current problem, nor have you suggested a new, interesting problem that it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: could solve. Worst of all, your qualification explains nothing, but spoils the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explanation of gravity that is the basis of the prevailing theory. It is this, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explanation that justifies our relying on the prevailing theory and not on, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: yours. Thus by all rational criteria your proposed qualification can be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: summarily rejected., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: CRYPTO-INDUCTIVIST: Couldn’t I say exactly the same thing about your, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theory? Your theory differs from mine only by the same minor qualification,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: but in reverse. You think I ought to have explained my qualification. But why, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: are our positions not symmetrical?, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: DAVID: Because your theory does not come with an explanation of its, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: predictions, and mine does., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: CRYPTO-INDUCTIVIST: But if my theory had been proposed first, it would, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: have been your theory that appeared to contain an unexplained qualification,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and it would be your theory that would be ‘summarily rejected’., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: DAVID: That is simply untrue. Any rational person who was comparing your, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theory with the prevailing one, even if yours had been proposed first, would, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: immediately reject your theory in favour of the prevailing one. For the fact, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that your theory is an unexplained modification of another theory is manifest, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: in your very statement of it., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: CRYPTO-INDUCTIVIST: You mean that my theory has the form ‘such-and-, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: such a theory holds universally, except in such-and-such a situation’, but I, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: don’t explain why the exception holds?, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: DAVID: Exactly., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: CRYPTO-INDUCTIVIST: Aha! Well, I think I can prove you wrong here (with, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the help of the philosopher Nelson Goodman). Consider a variant of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: English language that has no verb ‘to fall’. Instead it has a verb ‘to x-fall’, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: which means ‘to fall’ except when applied to you, in which case it means ‘to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: float’. Similarly, ‘to x-float’ means ‘to float’ except when applied to you, in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: which case it means ‘to fall’. In this new language I could express my theory, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: as the unqualified assertion ‘all objects x-fall if unsupported’. But the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: prevailing theory (which in English says ‘all objects fall if unsupported’), Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: would, in the new language, have to be qualified: ‘all objects x-fall when, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: unsupported, except David, who x-floats’. So which of these two theories is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: qualified depends on the language they are expressed in, doesn’t it?, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: DAVID: In form, yes. But that is a triviality. Your theory contains, in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: substance, an unexplained assertion, qualifying the prevailing theory. The, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: prevailing theory is, in substance, your theory stripped of an unexplained, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: qualification. No matter how you slice it, that is an objective fact,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: independent of language., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: CRYPTO-INDUCTIVIST: I don’t see why. You yourself used the form of my, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theory to spot the ‘unnecessary qualification’. You said that it was ‘manifest’, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: as an additional clause in my very statement of the theory — in English. But, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: when the theory is translated into my language, no qualification is manifest;, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and on the contrary, a manifest qualification appears in the very statement of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the prevailing theory., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: DAVID: So it does. But not all languages are equal. Languages are theories., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: In their vocabulary and grammar, they embody substantial assertions about, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the world. Whenever we state a theory, only a small part of its content is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explicit: the rest is carried by the language. Like all theories, languages are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: invented and selected for their ability to solve certain problems. In this case, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the problems are those of expressing other theories in forms in which it is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: convenient to apply them, and to compare and criticize them. One of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: most important ways in which languages solve these problems is to embody,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: implicitly, theories that are uncontroversial and taken for granted, while, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: allowing things that need to be stated or argued about to be expressed, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: CRYPTO-INDUCTIVIST: I accept that., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: DAVID: Thus it is no accident when a language chooses to cover the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: conceptual ground with one set of concepts rather than another. It reflects, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the current state of the speakers’ problem-situation. That is why the form of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: your theory, in English, is a good indication of its status vis a vis the current, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: problem-situation — whether it solves problems or exacerbates them. But it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: is not the form of your theory I am complaining about. It is the substance. My, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: complaint is that your theory solves nothing and only exacerbates the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: problem-situation. This defect is manifest when the theory is expressed in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: English, and implicit when it is expressed in your language. But it is no less, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: severe for that. I could state my complaint equally well in English, or in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: scientific jargon, or in your proposed language or in any language capable of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: expressing the discussion we have been having. (It is a Popperian maxim, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that one should always be willing to carry on the discussion in the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: opponent’s terminology.), Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: CRYPTO-INDUCTIVIST: You may have a point there. But could you, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: elaborate? In what way does my theory exacerbate the problem-situation,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and why would this be obvious even to a native speaker of my hypothetical, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: language?, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: DAVID: Your theory asserts the existence of a physical anomaly which is not, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: present according to the prevailing theory. The anomaly is my alleged, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: immunity from gravity. Certainly, you can invent a language which expresses, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: this anomaly implicitly, so that statements of your theory of gravity need not, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: refer to it explicitly. But refer to it they do. A rose by any other name would, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: smell as sweet. Suppose that you — indeed suppose that everyone — were, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: a native speaker of your language, and believed your theory of gravity to be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: true. Suppose that we all took it entirely for granted, and thought it so natural, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that we used the same word ‘x-fall’ to describe what you or I would do if we, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: jumped over the railing. None of that alters in the slightest degree the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: obvious difference there would be between my response to gravity and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: everything else’s. If you fell over the railing, you might well envy me on the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: way down. You might well think, ‘if only I could respond to gravity as David, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: does, rather than in this entirely different way that I do!’, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: CRYPTO-INDUCTIVIST: That’s true. Just because the same word ‘x-falling’, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: describes your response to gravity and mine, I wouldn’t think that the actual, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: response is the same. On the contrary, being a fluent speaker of this, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: supposed language, I’d know very well that ‘x-falling’ was physically different, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: for you and for me, just as a native English speaker knows that the words, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘being drunk’ mean something physically different for a person and for a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: glass of water. I wouldn’t think, ‘if this had happened to David, he’d be x-, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: falling just as I am’. I’d think, ‘if this had happened to David, he’d x-fall and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: survive, while I shall x-fall and die.’, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: DAVID: Moreover, despite your being sure that I would float, you wouldn’t, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: understand why. Knowing is not the same as understanding. You would be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: curious as to the explanation of this ‘well-known’ anomaly. So would, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: everyone else. Physicists would congregate from all over the world to study, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: my anomalous gravitational properties. In fact, if your language were really, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the prevailing one, and your theory were really taken for granted by, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: everyone, the scientific world would presumably have been impatiently, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: awaiting my very birth, and would be queuing for the privilege of dropping, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: me out of aircraft! But of course, the premise of all this, namely that your, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theory is taken for granted and embodied in the prevailing language, is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: preposterous. Theory or no theory, language or no language, in reality no, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: rational person would entertain the possibility of such a glaring physical, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: anomaly without there being a very powerful explanation in its favour., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Therefore, just as your theory would be summarily rejected, your language, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: would be rejected too, for it is just another way of stating your theory., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: CRYPTO-INDUCTIVIST: Could it be that there is a solution of the problem of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: induction lurking here after all? Let me see. How does this insight about, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: language change things? My argument relied upon an apparent symmetry, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: between your position and mine. We both adopted theories that were, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: consistent with existing experimental results, and whose rivals (except each, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: other) had been refuted. You said that I was being irrational because my, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theory involved an unexplained assertion, but I countered by saying that in a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: different language it would be your theory that contained such an assertion,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: so the symmetry was still there. But now you have pointed out that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: languages are theories, and that the combination of my proposed language, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and theory assert the existence of an objective, physical anomaly, as, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: compared with what the combination of the English language and the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: prevailing theory assert. This is where the symmetry between our positions,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and the argument I was putting forward, break down hopelessly., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: DAVID: Indeed they do., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: CRYPTO-INDUCTIVIST: Let me see if I can clarify this a little further. Are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: you saying that it is a principle of rationality that a theory which asserts the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: existence of an objective, physical anomaly is, other things being equal, less, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: likely to make true predictions than one that doesn’t?, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: DAVID: Not quite. Theories postulating anomalies without explaining them, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: are less likely than their rivals to make true predictions. More generally, it is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: a principle of rationality that theories are postulated in order to solve, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: problems. Therefore any postulate which solves no problem is to be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: rejected. That is because a good explanation qualified by such a postulate, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: becomes a bad explanation., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: CRYPTO-INDUCTIVIST: Now that I understand that there really is an, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: objective difference between theories which make unexplained predictions, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and theories which don’t, I must admit that this does look promising as a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: solution of the problem of induction. You seem to have discovered a way of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: justifying your future reliance on the theory of gravity, given only the past, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: problem-situation (including past observational evidence) and the distinction, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: between a good explanation and a bad one. You do not have to make any, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: assumption such as ‘the future is likely to resemble the past’., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: DAVID: It was not I who discovered this., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: CRYPTO-INDUCTIVIST: Well, I don’t think Popper did either. For one thing,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Popper did not think that scientific theories could be justified at all. You make, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: a careful distinction between theories being justified by observations (as, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: inductivists think) and being justified by argument. But Popper made no such, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: distinction. And in regard to the problem of induction, he actually said that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: although future predictions of a theory cannot be justified, we should act as, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: though they were!, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: DAVID: I don’t think he said that, exactly. If he did, he didn’t really mean it., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: CRYPTO-INDUCTIVIST: What?, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: DAVID: Or if he did mean it, he was mistaken. Why are you so upset? It is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: perfectly possible for a person to discover a new theory (in this case, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: Popperian epistemology) but nevertheless to continue to hold beliefs that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: contradict it. The more profound the theory is, the more likely this is to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: happen., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: CRYPTO-INDUCTIVIST: Are you claiming to understand Popper’s theory, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: better than he did himself?, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: DAVID: I neither know nor care. The reverence that philosophers show for, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the historical sources of ideas is very perverse, you know. In science we do, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: not consider the discoverer of a theory to have any special insight into it. On, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the contrary, we hardly ever consult original sources. They invariably, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: become obsolete, as the problem-situations that prompted them are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: transformed by the discoveries themselves. For example, most relativity, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theorists today understand Einstein’s theory better than he did. The founders, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of quantum theory made a complete mess of understanding their own, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theory. Such shaky beginnings are to be expected; and when we stand upon, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the shoulders of giants, it may not be all that hard to see further than they, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: did. But in any case, surely it is more interesting to argue about what the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: truth is, than about what some particular thinker, however great, did or did, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: not think., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: CRYPTO-INDUCTIVIST: All right, I agree. But wait a moment, I think I spoke, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: too soon when I said that you were not postulating any sort of principle of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: induction. Look: you have justified a theory about the future (the prevailing, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theory of gravity) as being more reliable than another theory (the one I, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: proposed), even though they are both consistent with all currently known, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: observations. Since the prevailing theory applies both to the future and to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the past, you have justified the proposition that, as regards gravity, the future, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: resembles the past. And the same would hold whenever you justify a theory, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: as reliable on the grounds that it is corroborated. Now, in order to go from, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘corroborated’ to ‘reliable’, you examined the theories’ explanatory power. So, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: what you have shown is that what we might call the ‘principle of seeking, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: better explanations’, together with some observations — yes, and arguments, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: — imply that the future will, in many respects, resemble the past. And that is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: a principle of induction! If your ‘explanation principle’ implies a principle of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: induction, then, logically, it is a principle of induction. So inductivism is true, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: after all, and a principle of induction does indeed have to be postulated,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explicitly or implicitly, before we can predict the future., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: DAVID: Oh dear! This inductivism really is a virulent disease. Having gone, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: into remission for only a few seconds, it now returns more violently than, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: before., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: CRYPTO-INDUCTIVIST: Does Popperian rationalism justify ad hominem, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: arguments as well? I ask for information only., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: DAVID: I apologize. Let me go straight to the substance of what you said., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Yes, I have justified an assertion about the future. You say this implies that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘the future resembles the past’. Well, vacuously, yes, inasmuch as any, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theory about the future would assert that it resembled the past in some, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: sense. But this inference that the future resembles the past is not the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: sought-for principle of induction, for we could neither derive nor justify any, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theory or prediction about the future from it. For example, we could not use it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to distinguish your theory of gravity from the prevailing one, for they both, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: say, in their own way, that the future resembles the past., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: CRYPTO-INDUCTIVIST: Couldn’t we derive, from the ‘explanation principle’,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: a form of the principle of induction that could be used to select theories?, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: What about: ‘if an unexplained anomaly does not happen in the past, then it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: is unlikely in the future’?, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: DAVID: No. Our justification does not depend on whether a particular, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: anomaly happens in the past. It has to do with whether there is an, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explanation for the existence of that anomaly., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: CRYPTO-INDUCTIVIST: All right then, let me formulate it more carefully: ‘if,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: in the present, there is no explanatory theory predicting that a particular, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: anomaly will happen in the future, then that anomaly is unlikely to happen in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the future’., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: DAVID: That may well be true. I, for one, believe that it is. However, it is not, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of the form ‘the future is likely to resemble the past’. Moreover, in trying to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: make it look as much like that as possible, you have specialized it to cases, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘in the present’, ‘in the future’, and to the case of an ‘anomaly’. But it is just, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: as true without these specializations. It is just a general statement about the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: efficacy of argument. In short, if there is no argument in favour of a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: postulate, then it is not reliable. Past, present or future. Anomaly or no, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: anomaly. Period., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: CRYPTO-INDUCTIVIST: Yes, I see., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: DAVID: Nothing in the concepts of ‘rational argument’ or ‘explanation’ relates, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the future to the past in any special way. Nothing is postulated about, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: anything ‘resembling’ anything. Nothing of that sort would help if it were, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: postulated. In the vacuous sense in which the very concept of ‘explanation’, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: implies that the future ‘resembles the past’, it nevertheless implies nothing, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: specific about the future, so it is not a principle of induction. There is no, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: principle of induction. There is no process of induction. No one ever uses, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: them or anything like them. And there is no longer a problem of induction. Is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that clear now?, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: adjust my entire world-view., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: DAVID: To assist you in that exercise, I think you should consider your, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: alternative ‘theory of gravity’ more closely., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: CRYPTO-INDUCTIVIST: …, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: DAVID: As we have agreed, your theory consists objectively of a theory of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: gravity (the prevailing theory), qualified by an unexplained prediction about, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: me. It says that I would float, unsupported. ‘Unsupported’ means ‘without, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: any upward force acting’ on me, so the suggestion is that I would be immune, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to the ‘force’ of gravity which would otherwise pull me down. But according to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the general theory of relativity, gravity is not a force but a manifestation of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the curvature of spacetime. This curvature explains why unsupported, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: objects, like myself and the Earth, move closer together with time. Therefore,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: in the light of modern physics your theory is presumably saying that there is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: an upward force on me, as required to hold me at a constant distance from, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the Earth. But where does that force come from, and how does it behave?, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: For example, what is a ‘constant distance’? If the Earth were to move, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: downwards, would I respond instantaneously to maintain the same height, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: (which would allow communication faster than the speed of light, contrary to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: another principle of relativity), or would the information about where the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: Earth is have to reach me at the speed of light first? If so, what carries this, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: information? Is it a new sort of wave emitted by the Earth — in which case, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: what equations does it obey? Does it carry energy? What is its quantum-, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mechanical behaviour? Or is it that I respond in a special way to existing, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: waves, such as light? In that case, would the anomaly disappear if an, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: opaque barrier were placed between me and the Earth? Isn’t the Earth, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mostly opaque anyway? Where does ‘the Earth’ begin: what defines the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: surface above which I am supposed to ‘float’?, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: CRYPTO-INDUCTIVIST: …, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: DAVID: For that matter, what defines where I begin? If I hold on to a heavy, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: weight, does it float too? If so, then the aircraft in which I have flown could, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: have switched off their engines without mishap. What counts as ‘holding, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: on’? Would the aircraft then drop if I let go of the arm rest? And if the effect, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: does not apply to things I am holding on to, what about my clothes? Will they, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: weigh me down and cause me to be killed after all, if I jump over the railing?, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: What about my last meal?, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: CRYPTO-INDUCTIVIST: …, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: DAVID: I could go on like this ad infinitum. The point is, the more we, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: consider the implications of your proposed anomaly, the more unanswered, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: questions we find. This is not just a matter of your theory being incomplete., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: These questions are dilemmas. Whichever way they are answered, they, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: create fresh problems by spoiling satisfactory explanations of other, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: CRYPTO-INDUCTIVIST: …, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: DAVID: So your additional postulate is not just superfluous, it is positively, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: bad. In general, perverse but unrefuted theories which one can propose off, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the cuff fall roughly into two categories. There are theories that postulate, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: unobservable entities, such as particles that do not interact with any other, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: matter. They can be rejected for solving nothing (‘Occam’s razor’, if you like)., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: And there are theories, like yours, that predict unexplained observable, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: anomalies. They can be rejected for solving nothing and spoiling existing, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: solutions. It is not, I hasten to add, that they conflict with existing, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: observations. It is that they remove the explanatory power from existing, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theories by asserting that the predictions of those theories have exceptions,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: but not explaining how. You can’t just say ‘spacetime geometry brings, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: unsupported objects together, unless one of them is David, in which case it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: leaves them alone’. Either the explanation of gravity is spacetime curvature, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: or it isn’t. Just compare your theory with the perfectly legitimate assertion, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: DAVID: Well, have you read my book, The Fabric of Reality?, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: CRYPTO-INDUCTIVIST: I certainly plan to, but for the moment the help that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: I was asking for concerns a very specific difficulty., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: DAVID: Go ahead., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: CRYPTO-INDUCTIVIST: The difficulty is this. When I rehearse the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: discussion we have been having, I am entirely convinced that your prediction, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of what would happen if you or I jumped off this tower was not derived from, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: any inductive hypothesis such as ‘the future resembles the past’. But when I, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: step back and consider the overall logic of the situation, I fear I still cannot, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: understand how that can be. Consider the raw materials for the argument., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Initially, I assumed that past observations and deductive logic are our only, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: raw material. Then I admitted that the current problem-situation is relevant, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: too, because we need justify our theory only as being more reliable than, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: existing rivals. And then I had to take into account that vast classes of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theories can be ruled out by argument alone, because they are bad, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explanations, and that the principles of rationality can be included in our raw, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: material. What I cannot understand is where in that raw material — past, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: observations, the present problem-situation and timeless principles of logic, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and rationality, none of which justifies inferences from the past to the future, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: — the justification of future predictions has come from. There seems to be a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: logical gap. Are we making a hidden assumption somewhere?, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: DAVID: No, there is no logical gap. What you call our ‘raw material’ does, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: indeed include assertions about the future. The best existing theories, which, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: cannot be abandoned lightly because they are the solutions of problems,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: contain predictions about the future. And these predictions cannot be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: severed from the theories’ other content, as you tried to do, because that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: would spoil the theories’ explanatory power. Any new theory we propose, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: must therefore either be consistent with these existing theories, which has, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: implications for what the new theory can say about the future, or contradict, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: some existing theories but address the problems thereby raised, giving, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: alternative explanations, which again constrains what they can say about the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: future., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: CRYPTO-INDUCTIVIST: So we have no principle of reasoning which says, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that the future will resemble the past, but we do have actual theories which, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: say that. So do we have actual theories which imply a limited form of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: inductive principle?, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: DAVID: No. Our theories simply assert something about the future., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Vacuously, any theory about the future implies that the future will ‘resemble, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the past’ in some ways. But we only find out in what respects the theory says, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that the future will resemble the past after we have the theory. You might as, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: well say that since our theories hold certain features of reality to be the same, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: throughout space, they imply a ‘spatial principle of induction’ to the effect, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that ‘the near resembles the distant’. Let me point out that, in any practical, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: sense of the word ‘resemble’, our present theories say that the future will not, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: resemble the past. The cosmological ‘Big Crunch’, for instance (the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: recollapse of the universe to a single point), is an event that some, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: cosmologists predict, but which is just about as unlike the present epoch, in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: every physical sense, as it could possibly be. The very laws from which we, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: predict its occurrence will not apply to it., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: CRYPTO-INDUCTIVIST: I am convinced on that point. Let me try one last, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: argument. We have seen that future predictions can be justified by appeal to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the principles of rationality. But what justifies those? They are not, after all,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: truths of pure logic. So there are two possibilities: either they are unjustified,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: in which case conclusions drawn from them are unjustified too; or they are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: justified by some as yet unknown means. In either case there is a missing, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: justification. I no longer suspect that this is the problem of induction in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: disguise. Nevertheless, having exploded the problem of induction, have we, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: not revealed another fundamental problem, also concerning missing, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: justification, beneath?, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: DAVID: What justifies the principles of rationality? Argument, as usual. What,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: for instance, justifies our relying on the laws of deduction, despite the fact, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that any attempt to justify them logically must lead either to circularity or to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: an infinite regress? They are justified because no explanation is improved by, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: replacing a law of deduction., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: CRYPTO-INDUCTIVIST: That doesn’t seem a very secure foundation for, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: pure logic., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: DAVID: It is not perfectly secure. Nor should we expect it to be, for logical, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: reasoning is no less a physical process than scientific reasoning is, and it is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: inherently fallible. The laws of logic are not self-evident. There are people,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the mathematical ‘intuitionists’, who disagree with the conventional laws of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: deduction (the logical ‘rules of inference’). I discuss their strange world-view, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: in Chapter 10 of The Fabric of Reality. They cannot be proved wrong, but I, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: shall argue that they are wrong, and I am sure you will agree that my, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: argument justifies this conclusion., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: CRYPTO-INDUCTIVIST: So you don’t think that there is a ‘problem of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: deduction’, then?, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: DAVID: No. I don’t think that there is a problem with any of the usual ways of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: justifying conclusions in science, philosophy or mathematics. However, it is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: an interesting fact that the physical universe admits processes that create, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: knowledge about itself, and about other things too. We may reasonably try to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explain this fact in the same way as we explain other physical facts, namely, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: through explanatory theories. You will see in Chapter 6 of The Fabric of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Reality that I think that the Turing principle is the appropriate theory in this, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: case. It says that it is possible to build a virtual-reality generator whose, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: repertoire includes every physically possible environment. If the Turing, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: principle is a law of physics, as I have argued that it is, then we should not, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: be surprised to find that we can form accurate theories about reality,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: because that is just virtual reality in action. Just as the fact that steam, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: engines are possible is a direct expression of the principles of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: thermodynamics, so the fact that the human brain is capable of creating, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: knowledge is a direct expression of the Turing principle., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: CRYPTO-INDUCTIVIST: But how do we know that the Turing principle is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: true?, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: DAVID: We don’t, of course … But you are afraid, aren’t you, that if we can’t, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: justify the Turing principle, then we shall once again have lost our, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: justification for relying on scientific predictions?, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: CRYPTO-INDUCTIVIST: Er, yes., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: DAVID: But we have now moved on to a completely different question! We, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: are now discussing an apparent fact about physical reality, namely that it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: can make reliable predictions about itself. We are trying to explain that fact,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to place it within the same framework as other facts we know. I suggested, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that there may be a certain law of physics involved. But if I were wrong about, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: that, indeed even if we were entirely unable to explain this remarkable, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: property of reality, that would not detract one jot from the justification of any, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: scientific theory. For it would not make the explanations in such a theory one, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: jot worse., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: CRYPTO-INDUCTIVIST: Now my arguments are exhausted. Intellectually, I, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: am convinced. Yet I must confess that I still feel what I can only describe as, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: an ‘emotional doubt’., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: DAVID: Perhaps it will help if I make one last comment, not about any of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: specific arguments you have raised, but about a misconception that seems, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to underlie many of them. You know that it is a misconception; yet you may, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: not yet have incorporated the ramifications of that into your world-view., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Perhaps that is the source of your ‘emotional doubt’., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: CRYPTO-INDUCTIVIST: Fire away., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: DAVID: The misconception is about the very nature of argument and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explanation. You seem to be assuming that arguments and explanations,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: such as those that justify acting on a particular theory, have the form of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mathematical proofs, proceeding from assumptions to conclusions. You look, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: for the ‘raw material’ (axioms) from which our conclusions (theorems) are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: derived. Now, there is indeed a logical structure of this type associated with, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: every successful argument or explanation. But the process of argument, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: does not begin with the ‘axioms’ and end with the ‘conclusion’. Rather, it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: starts in the middle, with a version that is riddled with inconsistencies, gaps,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ambiguities and irrelevancies. All these faults are criticized. Attempts are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: made to replace faulty theories. The theories that are criticized and replaced, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: usually include some of the ‘axioms’. That is why it is a mistake to assume, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that an argument begins with, or is justified by, the theories that eventually, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: serve as its ‘axioms’. The argument ends — tentatively — when it seems to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: have shown that the associated explanation is satisfactory. The ‘axioms’, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: adopted are not ultimate, unchallengeable beliefs. They are tentative,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explanatory theories., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: CRYPTO-INDUCTIVIST: I see. Argument is not the same species of thing as, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: deduction, or the non-existent induction. It is not based on anything or, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: justified by anything. And it doesn’t have to be, because its purpose is to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text:  From ancient times until about the nineteenth century, it was taken for, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: granted that some special animating force or factor was required to make the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: matter in living organisms behave so noticeably differently from other matter., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: This would mean in effect that there were two types of matter in the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: universe: animate matter and inanimate matter, with fundamentally different, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: physical properties. Consider a living organism such as a bear. A, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: other inanimate objects such as a dead bear, or even, in a very limited, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: you through the forest as you dodge round trees, and catch you and tear you, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: apart. Inanimate things never do anything as purposeful as that — or so the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ancients thought. They had, of course, never seen a guided missile., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: To Aristotle and other ancient philosophers, the most conspicuous feature of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: animate matter was its ability to initiate motion. They thought that when, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: inanimate matter, such as a rock, has come to rest, it never moves again, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: unless something kicks it. But animate matter, such as a hibernating bear,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: can be at rest and then begin to move without being kicked. With the benefit, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of modern science we can easily pick holes in these generalizations, and the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: very idea of ‘initiating motion’ now seems misconceived: we know that the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: bear wakes up because of electrochemical processes in its body. These may, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: be initiated by external ‘kicks’ such as rising temperature, or by an internal, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: biological clock which uses slow chemical reactions to keep time. Chemical, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: reactions are nothing more than the motion of atoms, so the bear never is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: entirely at rest. On the other hand a uranium nucleus, which is certainly not, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: alive, may remain unchanged for billions of years and then, without any, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: stimulus at all, suddenly and violently disintegrate. So the nominal content of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Aristotle’s idea is worthless today. But he did get one important thing right, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: which most modern thinkers have got wrong. In trying to associate life with a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: basic physical concept (albeit the wrong one, motion), he recognized that life, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: is a fundamental phenomenon of nature., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: A phenomenon is ‘fundamental’ if a sufficiently deep understanding of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: world depends on understanding that phenomenon. Opinions differ, of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: course, about what aspects of the world are worth understanding, and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: consequently about what is deep or fundamental. Some would say that love, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: is the most fundamental phenomenon in the world. Others believe that when, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: one has learned certain sacred texts by heart, one understands everything, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that is worth understanding. The understanding that I am talking about is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: connections between superficially diverse truths, explains more with fewer, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: are not large. It is quite hard even to detect them unambiguously., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: Nevertheless, we have seen that quantum interference is a fundamental, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: about physical reality, namely the existence of parallel universes., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: It was obvious to Aristotle that life is theoretically fundamental; and has large, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: physical effects. As we shall see, he was right. But it was obvious to him for, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: quite the wrong reasons, namely the supposedly distinctive mechanical, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: properties of animate matter, and the domination of the Earth’s surface by, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: living processes. Aristotle thought that the universe consists principally of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: what we now call the biosphere (life-containing region) of the Earth, with a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: few extra bits — celestial spheres and the Earth’s interior — tacked on, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: above and below. If the Earth’s biosphere is the principal component of your, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: cosmos, you will naturally think that trees and animals are at least as, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: important as rocks and stars in the great scheme of things, especially if you, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: know very little physics or biology. Modern science has led to almost the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: opposite conclusion. The Copernican revolution made the Earth subsidiary, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to a central, inanimate Sun. Subsequent discoveries in physics and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: astronomy showed not only that the universe is vast in comparison with the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Earth, but that it is described with enormous accuracy by all-encompassing, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: laws that make no mention of life at all. Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explained the origin of life in terms that required no special physics, and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: since then we have discovered many of the detailed mechanisms of life, and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: found no special physics there either., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: These spectacular successes of science, and the great generality of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Newtonian and subsequent physics in particular, did much to make, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: reductionism attractive. Since faith in revealed truth had been found to be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: incompatible with rationality (which requires an openness to criticism), many, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: people nevertheless yearned for an ultimate foundation to things in which, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: they could believe. If they did not yet have a reductive ‘theory of everything’, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to believe in, then at least they aspired to one. It was taken for granted that a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: reductionist hierarchy of sciences, based on subatomic physics, was integral, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to the scientific world-view, and so it was criticized only by pseudo-scientists, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and others who rebelled against science itself. Thus, by the time I learned, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: biology in school, the status of that subject had changed to the opposite of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: what Aristotle thought was obvious. Life was not considered to be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: fundamental at all. The very term ‘nature study’ — meaning biology — had, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: become an anachronism. Fundamentally, nature was physics. I am, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: oversimplifying only a little if I characterize the prevailing view as follows., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: My classmates and I had to learn by heart a number of ‘characteristics of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: living things’. These were merely descriptive. They made little reference to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: fundamental concepts. Admittedly, (loco) motion was one of them — an ill-, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: defined echo of the Aristotelian idea — but respiration and excretion were, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: among them as well. There was also reproduction, growth, and the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: memorably named irritability, which meant that if you kick it, it kicks back., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: What these supposed characteristics of life lack in elegance and profundity,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: they do not make up in accuracy. As Dr Johnson would tell us, every real, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: object is ‘irritable’. On the other hand, viruses do not respire, grow, excrete,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: or move (unless kicked), but they are alive. And sterile human beings do not, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: reproduce, yet they are alive too., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: The reason why both Aristotle’s view and that of my school textbooks failed, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to capture even a good taxonomic distinction between living and non-living, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: things, let alone anything deeper, is that they both miss the point about what, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: living things are (a mistake more forgivable in Aristotle because in his day no, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: one knew any better). Modern biology does not try to define life by some, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: characteristic physical attribute or substance — some living ‘essence’ — with, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: which only animate matter is endowed. We no longer expect there to be any, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: such essence, because we now know that ‘animate matter’, matter in the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: form of living organisms, is not the basis of life. It is merely one of the effects, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of life, and the basis of life is molecular. It is the fact that there exist, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: molecules which cause certain environments to make copies of those, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: molecules., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Such molecules are called replicators. More generally, a replicator is any, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: entity that causes certain environments to copy it. Not all replicators are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: biological, and not all replicators are molecules. For example, a self-copying, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: computer program (such as a computer virus) is a replicator. A good joke is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: another replicator, for it causes its listeners to retell it to further listeners., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Richard Dawkins has coined the term meme (rhyming with ‘cream’) for, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: replicators that are human ideas, such as jokes. But all life on Earth is based, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: on replicators that are molecules. These are called genes, and biology is the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: study of the origin, structure and operation of genes, and of their effects on, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: other matter. In most organisms a gene consists of a sequence of smaller, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: molecules, of which there are four different kinds, joined together in a chain., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: The names of the component molecules (adenine, cytosine, guanine and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: thymine) are usually shortened to A, C, G and T. The abbreviated chemical, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: name for a chain of any number of A, C, G and T molecules, in any order, is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: DNA., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Genes are in effect computer programs, expressed as sequences of A, C, G, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and T symbols in a standard language called the genetic code which, with, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: very slight variations, is common to all life on Karth. (Some viruses are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: based on a related type of molecule, RNA, while prions are, in a sense, self-, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: replicating protein molecules.) Special structures within each organism’s, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: cells act as computers to execute these gene programs. The execution, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: consists of manufacturing certain molecules (proteins) from simpler, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: molecules (amino acids) under certain external conditions. For example, the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: sequence ‘ATG’ is an instruction to incorporate the amino acid methionine, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: into the protein molecule being manufactured., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Typically, a gene is chemically ‘switched on’ in certain cells of the body, and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: then instructs those cells to manufacture the corresponding protein. For, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: example, the hormone insulin, which controls blood sugar levels in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: vertebrates, is such a protein. The gene for manufacturing it is present in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: almost every cell of the body, but it is switched on only in certain specialized, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: cells in the pancreas, and then only when it is needed. At the molecular, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: level, this is all that any gene can program its cellular computer to do:, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: manufacture a certain chemical. But genes succeed in being replicators, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: because these low-level chemical programs add up, through layer upon, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: layer of complex control and feedback, to sophisticated high-level, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: instructions. Jointly, the insulin gene and the genes involved in switching it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: on and off amount to a complete program for the regulation of sugar in the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: bloodstream., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Similarly, there are genes which contain specific instructions for how and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: when they and other genes are to be copied, and instructions for the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: manufacture of further organisms of the same species, including the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: molecular computers which will execute all these instructions again in the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: next generation. There are also instructions for how the organism as a whole, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: should respond to stimuli — for instance, when and how it should hunt, eat,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mate, fight or run away. And so on., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: A gene can function as a replicator only in certain environments. By analogy, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: with an ecological ‘niche’ (the set of environments in which an organism can, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: survive and reproduce), I shall also use the term niche for the set of all, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: possible environments which a given replicator would cause to make copies, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of it. The niche of an insulin gene includes environments where the gene is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: located in the nucleus of a cell in the company of certain other genes, and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the cell itself is appropriately located within a functioning organism, in a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: habitat suitable for sustaining the organism’s life and reproduction. But there, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: are also other environments — such as biotechnology laboratories in which, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: bacteria are genetically altered so as to incorporate the gene — which, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: likewise copy the insulin gene. Those environments are also part of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: gene’s niche, as are an infinity of other possible environments that are very, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: different from those in which the gene evolved., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Not everything that can be copied is a replicator. A replicator causes its, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: environment to copy it: that is, it contributes causally to its own copying. (My, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: terminology differs slightly from that used by Dawkins. Anything that is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: copied, for whatever reason, he calls a replicator. What I call a replicator he, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: would call an active replicator.) What it means in general to contribute, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: causally to something is an issue to which I shall return, but what I mean, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: here is that the presence and specific physical form of the replicator makes a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: difference to whether copying takes place or not. In other words, the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: replicator is copied if it is present, but if it were replaced by almost any other, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: object, even a rather similar one, that object would not be copied. For, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: example, the insulin gene causes only one small step in the enormously, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: complicated process of its own replication (that process being the whole life, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: cycle of the organism). But the overwhelming majority of variants of that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: gene would not instruct cells to manufacture a chemical that could do the job, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of insulin. If the insulin genes in an individual organism’s cells were replaced, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: by slightly different molecules, that organism would die (unless it were kept, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: alive by other means), and would therefore I ail to have offspring, and those, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: molecules would not be copied. So whether copying takes place or not is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: exquisitely sensitive to the physical form of the insulin gene. The presence of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the gene in us proper form and location makes a difference to whether, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: copying takes place, which makes it a replicator, though there are countless, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: other causes contributing to its replication as well., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Along with genes, random sequences of A, C, G and T, sometimes called, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: junk DNA sequences, are present in the DNA of most organisms. They are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: also copied and passed on to the organisms’ offspring. However, if such a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: sequence is replaced by almost any other sequence of similar length, it is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: still copied. So we can infer that the copying of such sequences does not, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: depend on their specific physical form. Unlike genes, junk DNA sequences, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: are not programs. If they have a function (and it is not known whether they, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: do), it cannot be to carry information of any kind. Although they are copied,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: they do not contribute causally to their own copying, and are therefore not, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: replicators., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Actually, that is an exaggeration. Anything that is copied must have made at, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: least some causal contribution to that copying. Junk DNA sequences, for, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: instance, are made of DNA, which allows the cellular computer to copy them., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: It cannot copy molecules other than DNA. It is not usually illuminating to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: consider something as a replicator if its causal contribution to its own, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: replication is small, though strictly speaking being a replicator is a matter of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: degree. I shall define the degree of adaptation of a replicator to a given, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: environment as the degree to which the replicator contributes causally to its, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: own replication in that environment. If a replicator is well adapted to most, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: environments of a niche, we may call it well adapted to the niche. We have, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: just seen that the insulin gene is highly adapted to its niche. Junk D N A, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: sequences have a negligible degree of adaptation by comparison with the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: insulin gene, or any other bona fide gene, but they are far more adapted to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that niche than most molecules are., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Notice that to quantify degrees of adaptation, we have to consider not only, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the replicator in question but also a range of variants of it. The more, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: sensitive the copying in a given environment is to the replicator’s exact, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: physical structure, the more adapted the replicator is to that environment., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: For highly adapted replicators (which are the only ones worth calling, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: replicators) we need consider only fairly small variations, because under, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: most large variations they would no longer be replicators. So we are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: contemplating replacing the replicator by broadly similar objects. To quantify, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the degree of adaptation to a niche, we have to consider the replicator’s, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: degree of adaptation to each environment of the niche. We must therefore, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: consider variants of the environment as well as of the replicator. If most, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: variants of the replicator fail to cause most environments of its niche to copy, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: them, then it would follow that our replicator’s form is a significant cause of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: its own copying in that niche, which is what we mean by saying that it is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: highly adapted to the niche. On the other hand, if most variants of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: replicator would be copied in most of the environments of the niche, then the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: form of our replicator makes little difference, in that copying would occur, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: anyway. In that case, our replicator makes little causal contribution to its, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: copying, and it is not highly adapted to that niche., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: So the degree of adaptation of a replicator depends not only on what that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: replicator does in its actual environment, but also on what a vast number of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: other objects, most of which do not exist, would do, in a vast number of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: environments other than the actual one. We have encountered this curious, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: sort of property before. The accuracy of a virtual-reality rendering depends, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: not only on the responses the machine actually makes to what the user, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: actually does, but also on responses it does not, in the event, make to things, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the user does not in fact do. This similarity between living processes and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: virtual reality is no coincidence, as I shall shortly explain., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: The most important factor determining a gene’s niche is usually that the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: gene’s replication depends on the presence of other genes. For example,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the replication of a bear’s insulin gene depends not only on the presence, in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the bear’s body, of all its other genes, but also on the presence, in the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: external environment, of genes from other organisms. Bears cannot survive, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: without food, and the genes for manufacturing that food exist only in other, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: organisms., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Different types of gene which need each other’s cooperation to replicate, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: often live joined together in long DNA chains, the DNA of an organism. An, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: organism is the sort of thing — such as an animal, plant or microbe — which, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: in everyday terms we usually think of as being alive. But it follows from what, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: I have said that ‘alive’ is at best a courtesy title when applied to the parts of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: an organism other than its DNA. An organism is not a replicator: it is part of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the environment of replicators — usually the most important part after the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: other genes. The remainder of the environment in the type of habitat that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: can be occupied by the organism (such as mountain tops or ocean bottoms), Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and the particular life-style within that habitat (such as hunter or filter-feeder), Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: which enables the organism to survive for long enough for its genes to be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: replicated., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: In everyday parlance we speak of organisms ‘reproducing themselves’;, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: indeed, this was one of the supposed ‘characteristics of living things’. In, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: other words, we think of organisms as replicators. But this is inaccurate., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Organisms are not copied during reproduction; far less do they cause their, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: own copying. They are constructed afresh according to blueprints embodied, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: in the parent organisms’ DNA. For example, if the shape of a bear’s nose is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: altered in an accident, it may change the life-style of that particular bear, and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the bear’s chances of surviving to ‘reproduce itself’ may be affected for, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: better or worse. But the bear with the new shape of nose has no chance of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: being copied. If it does have offspring, they will have noses of the original, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: shape. But make a change in the corresponding gene (if you do it just after, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the bear is conceived, you need only change one molecule), and any, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: offspring will not only have noses of the new shape, but copies of the new, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: gene as well. This shows that the shape of each nose is caused by that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: gene, and not by the shape of any previous nose. So the shape of the bear’s, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: nose makes no causal contribution to the shape of the offspring’s nose. But, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the shape of the bear’s genes contributes both to their own copying and to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the shape of the bear’s nose and of its offspring’s nose., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: So an organism is the immediate environment which copies the real, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: replicators: the organism’s genes. Traditionally, a bear’s nose and its den, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: would have been classified as living and non-living entities, respectively. But, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that distinction is not rooted in any significant difference. The role of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: bear’s nose is fundamentally no different from that of its den. Neither is a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: replicator, though new instances of them are continually being made. Both, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the nose and the den are merely parts of the environment which the bear’s, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: genes manipulate in the course of getting themselves replicated., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: This gene-based understanding of life — regarding organisms as part of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: environment of genes — has implicitly been the basis of biology since, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Darwin, but it was overlooked until at least the 1960s, and not fully, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: understood until Richard Dawkins published The Selfish Gene (1976) and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: The Extended Phenotype (1982)., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: I now return to the question whether life is a fundamental phenomenon of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: nature. I have warned against the reductionist assumption that emergent, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: phenomena, such as life, are necessarily less fundamental than microscopic, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: physical ones. Nevertheless, everything I have just been saying about what, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: life is seems to point to its being a mere side-effect at the end of a long chain, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of side-effects. For it is not merely the predictions of biology that reduce, in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: principle, to those of physics: it is, on the face of it, also the explanations. As, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: I have said, the great explanatory theories of Darwin (in modern versions, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: such as that propounded by Dawkins), and of modern biochemistry, are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: reductive. Living molecules genes — are merely molecules, obeying the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: same laws of physics and chemistry as non-living ones. They contain no, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: special substance, nor do they have any special physical attributes. They, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: just happen, in certain environments, to be replicators. The property of being, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: a replicator is highly contextual — that is, it depends on intricate details of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the replicator’s environment: an entity is a replicator in one environment and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: not in another. Also, the property of being adapted to a niche does not, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: depend on any simple, intrinsic physical attribute that the replicator has at, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the time, but on effects that it may cause in the future — and under, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: hypothetical circumstances at that (i.e. in variants of the environment)., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Contextual and hypothetical properties are essentially derivative, so it is hard, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to see how a phenomenon characterized only by such properties could, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: possibly be a fundamental phenomenon of nature., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: As for the physical impact of life, the conclusion is the same: the effects of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: life seem negligibly small. For all we know, the planet Earth is the only place, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: in the universe where life exists. Certainly we have seen no evidence of its, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: existence elsewhere, so even if it in quite widespread its effects are too, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: small to be perceptible to us. What we do see beyond the Earth is an active, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: Galaxies revolve. Stars condense, shine, flare, explode and collapse. High-, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: energy particles and electromagnetic and gravitational waves scream in all, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: processes seems to make no difference. It seems that none of them would, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: enveloped in a large solar flare, itself an insignificant event astrophysically,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: geometrically, theoretically or practically, is of almost inconceivable, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: insignificance. Biology, in this picture, is a subject with the same status as, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: geography. Knowing the layout of the city of Oxford is important to those of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: us who live there, but unimportant to those who never visit Oxford. Similarly,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: it seems that life is a property of some parochial area, or perhaps areas, of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the universe, fundamental to us because we are alive, but not at all, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: fundamental either theoretically or practically in the larger scheme of things., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: But remarkably, this appearance is misleading, It is simply not true that life is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: insignificant in its physical effects, nor is it theoretically derivative., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: As a first step to explaining this, let me explain my earlier remark that life is a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: form of virtual-reality generation. I have used the word ‘computers’ for the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mechanisms that execute gene programs inside living cells, but that is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: slightly loose terminology. Compared with the general-purpose computers, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that we manufacture artificially, they do more in some respects and less in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: others. One could not easily program them to do word processing or to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: factorize large numbers. On the other hand, they exert exquisitely accurate,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: interactive control over the responses of a complex environment (the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: organism) to everything that may happen to it. And this control is directed, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: towards causing the environment to act back upon the genes in a specific, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: way (namely, to replicate them) such that the net effect on the genes is as, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: independent as possible of what may be happening outside. This is more, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: than just computing. It is virtual-reality rendering., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: The analogy with the human technology of virtual reality is no perfect. First,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: although genes are enveloped, just as a user of virtual reality is, in an, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: environment whose detailed constitution and behaviour are specified by a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: program (which the genes themselves embody), the genes do not, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: experience that environment because they have neither senses nor, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: experiences. So if an organism is an virtual-reality rendering specified by its, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: genes, it is a rendering without an audience. Second, the organism is not, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: only being rendered, it is being manufactured. It is not a matter of ‘fooling’, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the gene into believing that there is an organism out there. The organism, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: really is out there., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: However, these differences are unimportant. As I have said, all virtual-reality, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: rendering physically manufactures the rendered environment. The inside of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: any virtual-reality generator in the act of rendering is precisely a real,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: physical environment, manufactured to have the properties specified in the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: program. It is just that we users sometimes choose to interpret it as a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: different environment, which happens to feel the same. As for the absence, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of a user, let us consider explicitly what the role of the user of virtual reality, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: is. First, it is to kick the rendered environment and to be kicked back in return, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: — in other words, to interact with the environment in an autonomous way. In, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the biological case, that role is performed by the external habitat. Second, it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: is to provide the intention behind the rendering. That is to say, it makes little, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: sense to speak of a particular situation as being a virtual-reality rendering if, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: there is no concept of the rendering being accurate or inaccurate. I have, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: said that the accuracy of a rendering is the closeness, as perceived by the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: user, of the rendered environment to the intended one. But what does, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: accuracy mean for a rendering which no one intended and no one, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: perceives? It means the degree of adaptation of the genes to their niche. We, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: can infer the ‘intention’ of genes to render environment that will replicate, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: them, from Darwin’s theory of evolution. Genes become extinct if they do not, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: enact that ‘intention’ as efficiently or resolutely as other competing genes., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: So living processes and virtual-reality renderings are, superficial differences, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: aside, the same sort of process. Both involve the physical embodying of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: general theories about an environment. In both cases these theories are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: used to realize that environment and to control, interactively, not just its, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: instantaneous appearance but also its detailed response to general stimuli., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  Genes embody knowledge about their niches. Everything of fundamental, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: significance about the phenomenon of life depends on this property, and not, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: on replication per se. So we can now take the discussion beyond replicators., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: In principle, one could imagine a species whose genes were unable to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: replicate, but instead were adapted to keep their physical form unchanged, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: by continual self-maintenance and by protecting themselves from external, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: influences. Such a species is unlikely to evolve naturally, but it might be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: constructed artificially. Just as the degree of adaptation of a replicator is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: defined as the degree to which it contributes causally to its own replication,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: we can define the degree of adaptation of these non-replicating genes as the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: degree to which they contribute to their own survival in a particular form., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Consider a species whose genes were patterns etched in diamond. An, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ordinary diamond with a haphazard shape might survive for aeons under a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: wide range of circumstances, but that shape is not adapted for survival, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: because a differently shaped diamond would also survive under similar, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: circumstances. But if the diamond-encoded genes of our hypothetical, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: species caused the organism to behave in a way which, for instance,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: protected the diamond’s etched surface from corrosion in a hostile, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: environment, or defended it against other organisms that would try to etch, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: different information into it, or against thieves who would cut and polish it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: into a gemstone, then it would contain genuine adaptations for survival in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: those environments. (Incidentally, a gemstone does have a degree of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: adaptation for survival in the environment of present-day Earth. Humans, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: seek out uncut diamonds and change their shapes to those of gemstones., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: But they seek out gemstones and preserve their shapes. So in this, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: environment, the shape of a gemstone contributes causally to its own, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: survival.), Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: When the manufacture of these artificial organisms ceased, the number of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: instances of each non-replicating gene could never again increase. But nor, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: would it decrease, so long as the knowledge it contained was sufficient for it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to enact its survival strategy in the niche it occupied. Eventually a sufficiently, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: large change in the habitat, or attrition caused by accidents, might wipe out, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the species, but it might well survive for as long as many a naturally, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: occurring species. The genes of such species share all the properties of real, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: genes except replication. In particular, they embody the knowledge, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: necessary to render their organisms in just the way that real genes do., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: It is the survival of knowledge, and not necessarily of the gene or any other, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: physical object, that is the common factor between replicating and non-, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: replicating genes. So, strictly speaking, it is a piece of knowledge rather than, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: a physical object that is or is not adapted to a certain niche. If it is adapted,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: then it has the property that once it is embodied in that niche, it will tend to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: remain so. With a replicator, the physical material that embodies it keeps, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: changing, a new copy being assembled out of non-replicating components, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: every time replication occurs. Non-replicating knowledge may also be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: successively embodied in different physical forms, for example when a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: vintage sound recording is transferred from vinyl record to magnetic tape,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and later to compact disc. One could imagine another artificial non-, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: replicator-based living organism that did the same sort of thing, taking every, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: opportunity to copy the knowledge in its genes onto the safest medium, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: available. Perhaps one day our descendants will do that., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: I think it would be perverse to call the organisms of these hypothetical, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: species ‘inanimate’, but the terminology is not really important. The point is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that although all known life is based on replicators, what the phenomenon of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: life is really about is knowledge. We can give a definition of adaptation, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: directly in terms of knowledge: an entity is adapted to its niche if it embodies, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: knowledge that causes the niche to keep that knowledge in existence. Now, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: we are getting closer to the reason why life is fundamental. Life is about the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: physical embodiment of knowledge, and in Chapter 6 we came across a law, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of physics, the Turing principle, which is also about the physical embodiment, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of knowledge. It says that it is possible to embody the laws of physics, as, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: they apply to every physically possible environment, in programs for a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: virtual-reality generator. Genes are such programs. Not only that, but all, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: other virtual-reality programs that physically exist, or will ever exist, are direct, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: or indirect effects of life. For example, the virtual-reality programs that run on, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: our computers and in our brains are indirect effects of human life. So life is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the means — presumably a necessary means — by which the effects, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: referred to in the Turing principle have been implemented in nature., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: This is encouraging, but it is not quite sufficient to establish that life is a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: fundamental phenomenon. For I have not yet established that the Turing, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: principle itself has the status of a fundamental law. A sceptic might argue, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that it does not. It is a law about the physical embodiment of knowledge, and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the sceptic might take the view that knowledge is a parochial,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: anthropocentric concept rather than a fundamental one. That is, it is one of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: those things which is significant to us because of what we are — animals, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: whose ecological niche depends on creating and applying knowledge — but, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: not significant in an absolute sense. To a koala bear, whose ecological niche, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: depends on eucalyptus leaves, eucalyptus is significant; to the knowledge-, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: wielding ape Homo sapiens, knowledge is significant, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: But the sceptic would be wrong. Knowledge is significant not only to Homo, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: sapiens, nor only on the planet Earth. I have said that whether something, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: does or does not have a large physical impact is not decisive as to whether it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: is fundamental in nature. But it is relevant. Let us consider the astrophysical, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: effects of knowledge. The theory of stellar evolution — the structure and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: development of stars — is one of the success stories of science. (Note the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: clash of terminology here. The word ‘evolution’ in physics means, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: development, or simply motion, not variation and selection.) Only a century, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ago, even the source of the Sun’s energy was unknown. The best physics of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the day provided only the false conclusion that whatever its energy source, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: was, the Sun could not have been shining for more than a hundred million, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: years. Interestingly, the geologists and palaeontologists already knew, from, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: fossil evidence of what life had been doing, that the Sun must have been, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: shining on Earth for a billion years at least. Then nuclear physics was, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: discovered, and was applied in great detail to the physics of interiors of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: stars. Since then the theory of stellar evolution has matured. We now, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: understand what makes a star shine. For most types of star we can predict, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: what temperature, colour, luminosity and diameter it has at each stage of its, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: history, how long each stage lasts, what elements the star creates by, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: nuclear transmutation, and so on. This theory has been tested and borne out, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: by observations of the Sun and other stars., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: We can use the theory to predict the future development of the Sun. It says, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that the Sun will continue to shine with great stability for another five billion, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: years or so; then it will expand to about a hundred times its present diameter, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to become a red giant star; then it will pulsate, flare into a nova, collapse and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: cool, eventually becoming a black dwarf. But will all this really happen to the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Sun? Has every star that formed a few billion years before the Sun, with the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: same mass and composition, already become a red giant, as the theory, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: predicts? Or is it possible that some apparently insignificant chemical, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: processes on minor planets orbiting those stars might alter the course of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: nuclear and gravitational processes having overwhelmingly more mass and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: energy?, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: If the Sun does become a red giant, it will engulf and destroy the Earth. If, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: any of our descendants, physical or intellectual, are still on the Earth at that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: time, they might not want that to happen. They might do everything in their, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: power to prevent it., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Is it obvious that they will not be able to? Certainly, our present technology is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: far too puny to do the job. But neither our theory of stellar evolution nor any, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: other physics we know gives any reason to believe that the task is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: impossible. On the contrary, we already know, in broad terms, what it would, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: involve (namely, removing matter from the Sun). And we have several billion, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: years to perfect our half-baked plans and put them into practice. If, in the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: event, our descendants do succeed in saving themselves in this way, then, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: our present theory of stellar evolution, when applied to one particular star,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the Sun, gives entirely the wrong answer. And the reason why it gives the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: wrong answer is that it does not take into account the effect of life on stellar, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: evolution. It takes into account such fundamental physical effects as nuclear, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and electromagnetic forces, gravity, hydrostatic pressure and radiation, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: pressure — but not life., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: It seems likely that the knowledge required to control the Sun in this way, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: could not evolve by natural selection alone, so it must specifically be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: intelligent life on whose presence the future of the Sun depends. Now, it may, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: be objected that it is a huge and unsupported assumption that intelligence, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: will survive on Earth for several billion years, and even if it does, it is a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: further assumption that it will then possess the knowledge required to control, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the Sun. One current view is that intelligent life on Earth is even now in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: danger of destroying itself, if not by nuclear war then by some catastrophic, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: side-effect of technological advance or scientific research. Many people think, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that if intelligent life is to survive on Earth, it will do so only by suppressing, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: technological progress. So they might fear that our developing the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: technology required to regulate stars is incompatible with surviving for long, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: enough to use that technology, and therefore that life on Earth is destined,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: one way or another, not to affect the evolution of the Sun., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: I am sure that this pessimism is misguided, and, as I shall explain in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Chapter 14, there is every reason to conjecture that our descendants will, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: eventually control the Sun and much more. Admittedly, we can foresee, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: neither their technology nor their wishes. They may choose to save, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: themselves by emigrating from the solar system, or by refrigerating the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Earth, or by any number of methods, inconceivable to us, that do not involve, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: tampering with the Sun. On the other hand, they may wish to control the Sun, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: much sooner than would be required to prevent it from entering its red giant, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: phase (for example to harness its energy more efficiently, or to quarry it for, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: raw materials to construct more living space for themselves), However, the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: point I am making here does not depend on our being able to predict what, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: will happen, but only on the proposition that what will happen will depend on, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: what knowledge our descendants have, and on how they choose to apply it., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Thus one cannot predict the future of the Sun without taking a position on, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the future of life on Earth, and in particular on the future of knowledge. The, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: colour of the Sun ten billion years hence depends on gravity and radiation, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: pressure, on convection and nucleosynthesis. It does not depend at all on, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the geology of Venus, the chemistry of Jupiter, or the pattern of craters on, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the Moon. But it does depend on what happens to intelligent life on the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: planet Earth. It depends on politics and economics and the outcomes of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: wars. It depends on what people do: what decisions they make, what, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: problems they solve, what values they adopt, and on how they behave, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: towards their children., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: One cannot avoid this conclusion by adopting a pessimistic theory of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: prospects for our survival. Such a theory does not follow from the laws of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: physics or from any other fundamental principle that we know, and can be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: justified only in high-level, human terms (such as ‘scientific knowledge has, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: outrun moral knowledge’, or whatever). So, in arguing from such a theory, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: one is implicitly conceding that theories of human affairs are necessary for, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: making astrophysical predictions. And even if the human race will in the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: event fail in its efforts to survive, does the pessimistic theory apply to every, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: extraterrestrial intelligence in the universe? If not — if some intelligent life, in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: some galaxy, will ever succeed in surviving for billions of years — then life is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: significant in the gross physical development of the universe., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Throughout our Galaxy and the multiverse, stellar evolution depends on, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: whether and where intelligent life has evolved, and if so, on the outcomes of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: its wars and on how it treats its children. For example, we can predict, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: roughly what proportions of stars of different colours (more precisely, of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: different spectral types) there should be in the Galaxy. To do that we shall, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: have to make some assumptions about how much intelligent life there is out, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: there, and what it has been doing (namely, that it has not been switching off, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: too many stars). At the moment, our observations are consistent with there, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: being no intelligent life outside our solar system. When our theories of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: structure of our Galaxy are further refined, we shall be able to make more, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: precise predictions, but again only on the basis of assumptions about the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: distribution and behaviour of intelligence in the Galaxy. If those assumptions, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: are inaccurate we will predict the wrong distribution of spectral types just as, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: surely as if we were to make a mistake about the composition of interstellar, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: gases, or about the mass of the hydrogen atom. And, if we detect certain, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: anomalies in the distribution of spectral types, this could be evidence of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: presence of extraterrestrial intelligence. The cosmologists John Barrow and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Frank Tipler have considered the astrophysical effects that life would have if, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: it survived for long after the time at which the Sun would otherwise become a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: red giant. They have found that life would eventually make major, qualitative, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: changes to the structure of the Galaxy, and later to the structure of the whole, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: universe. (I shall return to these results in Chapter 14.) So once again, any, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: theory of the structure of the universe in all but its earliest stages must take, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: a position on what life will or will not be doing by then. There is no getting, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: away from it: the future history of the universe depends on the future history, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of knowledge. Astrologers used to believe that cosmic events influence, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: human affairs; science believed for centuries that neither influences the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: other. Now we see that human affairs influence cosmic events., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: It is worth reflecting on where we went astray in underestimating the physical, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: impact of life. It was by being too parochial. (That is ironic, because the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ancient consensus happened to avoid our mistake by being even more, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: parochial.) In the universe as we see it, life has affected nothing of any, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: astrophysical significance. However, we see only the past, and it is only the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: past of what is spatially near us that we see in any detail. The further we, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: look into the universe, the further back in time we see and the less detail we, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: see. But even the whole past — the history of the universe from the Big, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Bang until now — is just a small part of physical reality. There is at least ten, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: times as much history still to go, between now and the Big Crunch (if that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: happens), and probably a lot more, to say nothing of the other universes. We, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: cannot observe any of this, but when we apply our best theories to the future, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of the stars, and of the galaxies and the universe, we find plenty of scope for, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: life to affect and, in the long run, to dominate everything that happens, just, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: as it now dominates the Earth’s biosphere., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: The conventional argument for the insignificance of life gives too much, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: weight to bulk quantities like size, mass and energy. In the parochial past, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and present these were and are good measures of astrophysical, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: significance, but there is no reason within physics why that should continue, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to be so. Moreover, the biosphere itself already provides abundant counter-, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: examples to the general applicability of such measures of significance. In the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: third century BC, for instance, the mass of the human race was about ten, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: million tonnes. One might therefore conclude that it is unlikely that physical, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: processes occurring in the third century BC and involving the motion of many, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: times that mass could have been significantly affected by the presence or, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: absence of human beings. But the Great Wall of China, whose mass is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: about three hundred million tonnes, was built at that time. Moving millions of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: tonnes of rock is the sort of thing that human beings do all the time., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Nowadays it takes only a few dozen humans to excavate a million-tonne, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: railway cutting or tunnel. (The point is made even more strongly if we make a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: fairer comparison, between the mass of rock shifted and the mass of that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: tiny part of the engineer’s, or emperor’s, brain that embodies the ideas, or, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: memes, that cause the rock to be shifted.) The human race as a whole (or, if, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: you like, its stock of memes) probably already has enough knowledge to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: destroy whole planets, if its survival depended on doing so. Even non-, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: intelligent life has grossly transformed many times its own mass of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: surface and atmosphere of the Earth. All the oxygen in our atmosphere, for, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: instance about a thousand trillion tonnes — was created by plants and was, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: therefore a side-effect of the replication of genes, i.e. molecules, which were, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: descendants of a single molecule. Life achieves its effects not by being, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: larger, more massive or more energetic than other physical processes, but, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: by being more knowledgeable. In terms of its gross effect on the outcomes, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of physical processes, knowledge is at least as significant as any other, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: physical quantity., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: But is there, as the ancients assumed there must be in the case of life, a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: basic physical difference between knowledge-bearing and non-knowledge-, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: bearing objects, a difference that depends neither on the objects’, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: environments nor on their effects on the remote future, but only on the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: objects’ immediate physical attributes? Remarkably, there is. To see what it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: is, we must take the multiverse view., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Consider the DNA of a living organism, such as a bear, and suppose that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: somewhere in one of its genes we find the sequence TCGTCGTTTC. That, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: particular string of ten molecules, in the special niche consisting of the rest of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the gene and its niche, is a replicator. It embodies a small but significant, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: amount of knowledge. Now suppose, for the sake of argument, that we can, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: find a junk-DNA (non-gene) segment in the bear’s DNA which also has the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: sequence TCGTCGTTTC. Nevertheless this sequence is not; worth calling a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: replicator, because it contributes almost nothing to its replication, and it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: embodies no knowledge. It is a random sequence. So here we have two, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: physical objects, both segments of the same DNA chain, one of which, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: embodies knowledge and the other is a random sequence. But they are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: physically identical. How can knowledge be a fundamental physical quantity,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: if one object has it while a physically identical object does not?, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: It can, because these two segments are not really identical. They only look, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: identical when viewed from some universes, such as ours. Let us look at, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: them again, as they appear in other universes. We cannot directly observe, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: other universes, so we must use theory., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: We know that DNA in living organisms is naturally subject to random, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: variations — mutations — in the sequence of A, C, G and T molecules., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: According to the theory of evolution, the adaptations in genes, and therefore, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the genes’ very existence, depend on such mutations having occurred., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Because of mutations, populations of any gene contain a degree of variation,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and individuals carrying genes with higher degrees of adaptation tend to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: have more offspring than other individuals. Most variations in a gene make it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: unable to cause its replication, because the altered sequence no longer, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: instructs the cell to manufacture anything useful. Others merely make, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: replication less likely (that is, they narrow the gene’s niche). But some may, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: happen to embody new instructions that make replication more likely. Thus, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: natural selection occurs. With each generation of variation and replication, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the degree of adaptation of the surviving genes tends to increase. Now, a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: random mutation, caused for instance by a cosmic-ray strike, causes, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: variation not only within the population of the organism in one universe, but, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: between universes as well. A cosmic ‘ray’ is a high-energy sub-atomic, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: particle and, like a photon emitted from a torch, it travels in different, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: directions in different universes. So when a cosmic-ray particle strikes a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: DNA strand and causes a mutation, some of its counterparts in other, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: universes are missing their copies of the DNA strand altogether, while others, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: are striking it at different positions, and hence causing different mutations., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Thus a single cosmic-ray strike on a single DNA molecule will in general, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: cause a large range of different mutations to appear in different universes., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: When we are considering what a particular object may look like in other, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: universes, we must not look so far afield in the multiverse that it is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: impossible to identify a counterpart, in the other universe, of that object., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Take a DNA segment, for instance. In some universes there are no DNA, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: molecules at all. Some universes containing DNA are so dissimilar to ours, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that there is no way of identifying which DNA segment in the other universe, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: corresponds to the one we are considering in this universe. It is meaningless, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to ask what our particular DNA segment looks like in such a universe, so we, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: must consider only universes that are sufficiently similar to ours for this, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ambiguity not to arise. For instance, we could consider only those universes, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: in which bears exist, and in which a sample of DNA from a bear has been, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: placed in an analysing machine, which has been programmed to print out, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ten letters representing the structure at a specified position relative to certain, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: landmarks on a specified DNA strand. The following discussion would be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: unaffected if we were to choose any other reasonable criterion for identifying, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: corresponding segments of DNA in nearby universes., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: By any such criterion, the bear’s gene segment must have the same, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: sequence in almost all nearby universes as it does in ours. That is because it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: is presumably highly adapted, which means that most variants of it would not, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: succeed in getting themselves copied in most variants of their environment,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and so could not appear at that location in the DNA of a living bear. In, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: contrast, when the non-knowledge-bearing DNA segment undergoes almost, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: any mutation, the mutated version is still capable of being copied. Over, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: generations of replication many mutations will have occurred, and most of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: them will have had no effect on replication. Therefore the junk-DNA, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: segment, unlike its counterpart in the gene, will be thoroughly, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: heterogeneous in different universes. It may well be that every possible, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: variation of its sequence is equally represented in the multiverse (that is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: what we should mean by its sequence being strictly random)., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: So the multiverse perspective reveals additional physical structure in the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: bear’s DNA. In this universe, it contains two segments with the sequence, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: TCGTCGTTTC. One of them is part of a gene while the other is not part of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: any gene. In most other nearby universes, the first of the two segments has, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the same sequence, TCGTCGTTTC, as it does in our universe, but the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: second segment varies greatly between nearby universes. So from the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: multiverse perspective the two segments are not even remotely alike (Figure, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: 8.1)., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Again we were too parochial, and were led to the false conclusion: that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: knowledge-bearing entities can be physically identical to non knowledge-, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: bearing ones; and this in turn cast doubt on the fundamental status of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: knowledge. But now we have come almost full circle. We can see that the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ancient idea that living matter has special physical properties was almost, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: true: it is not living matter but knowledge-bearing matter that is physically, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: special. Within one universe it looks irregular; across universes it has a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: regular structure, like a crystal in the multiverse., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: So knowledge is a fundamental physical quantity after all, and the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: phenomenon of life is only slightly less so., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Imagine looking through an electron microscope at a DNA molecule from a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: bear’s cell, and trying to distinguish the genes from the non-gene sequences, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and to estimate the degree of adaptation of each gene. In any one universe,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: this task is impossible. The property of being a gene — that is, of being, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: highly adapted — is, in so far as it can be detected within one universe,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: overwhelmingly complicated. It is an emergent property. You would have to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: make many copies of the DNA, with variations, use genetic engineering to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: create many bear embryos for each variant of the DNA, allow the bears to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: would stand out from the non-genes just as cultivated fields stand out from a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: jungle in an aerial photograph, or like crystals that have precipitated from, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: solution. They are regular across many nearby universes, while all the non-, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: gene, junk-DNA segments are irregular. As for the degree of adaptation of a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: gene, this is almost as easy to estimate. The better-adapted genes will have, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the same structure over a wider range of universes — they will have bigger, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘crystals’., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Now go to an alien planet, and try to find the local life-forms, if any. Again,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: subtle experiments whose infinite pitfalls have been the subject of many a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: science-fiction story. But if only you could observe through a multiverse, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: telescope, life and its consequences would be obvious at a glance. You, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: need only look for complex structures that seem irregular in any one, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: universe, but are identical across many nearby universes. If you see any,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: you will have found some physically embodied knowledge. Where there is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: knowledge, there must have been life, at least in the past., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Compare a living bear with the Great Bear constellation. The living bear is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: anatomically very similar in many nearby universes. It is not only its genes, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that have that property, but its whole body (though other attributes of its, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: body, such as its weight, vary much more than the genes; that is because,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: for example, in different universes the bear has been more or less, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: successful in its recent search for food). But in the Great Bear constellation, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: there is no such regularity from one universe to another. The shape of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: constellation is a result of the initial conditions in the galactic gas from which, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the stars formed. Those conditions were random — very diverse in different, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: universes, at a microscopic level — and the process of the formation of stars, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: from that gas involved various instabilities which amplified the scale of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: variations. As a result, the pattern of stars that we see in the constellation, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: exists in only a very narrow range of universes. In most nearby variants of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: our universe there are also constellations in the sky, but they look different., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Finally, let us look around the universe in a similar way. What will catch our, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: magically enhanced eye? In a single universe the most striking structures, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: are galaxies and clusters of galaxies. But those objects have no discernible, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: structure across the multiverse. Where there is a galaxy in one universe, a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: myriad galaxies with quite different geographies are stacked in the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: multiverse. And so it is everywhere in the multiverse. Nearby universes are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: alike only in certain gross features, as required by the laws of physics, which, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: apply to them all. Thus most stars are quite accurately spherical everywhere, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: in the multiverse, and most galaxies are spiral or elliptical. But nothing, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: extends far into other universes without its detailed structure changing, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text:   , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Scientific progress since Galileo has seemed to refute the ancient idea that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: life is a fundamental phenomenon of nature. It has revealed the vast scale of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the universe, compared with the Earth’s biosphere. Modern biology seems to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: have confirmed this refutation, by explaining living processes in terms of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: molecular replicators, genes, whose behaviour is governed by the same, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: laws of physics as apply to inanimate matter. Nevertheless, life is associated, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: with a fundamental principle of physics — the Turing principle — since it is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the means by which virtual reality was first realized in nature. Also, despite, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: appearances, life is a significant process on the largest scales of both time, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and space. The future behaviour of life will determine the future behaviour of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: stars and galaxies. And the largest-scale regular structure across universes, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: exists where knowledge-bearing matter, such as brains or DNA gene, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: segments, has evolved., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text:  This direct connection between the theory of evolution and quantum theory, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: is, to my mind, one of the most striking and unexpected of the many, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: connections between the four strands. Another is the existence of a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: substantive quantum theory of computation underlying the existing theory of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: of a new technology — the latest, perhaps, in the remark able succession, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that has included mechanical computation, transistorized electronic, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: computation, silicon-chip computation, and so on. And it is true that even, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: existing computer technology relies on microscopic quantum-mechanical, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: processes. (Of course all physical processes are quantum-mechanical, but, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: here I mean ones for which classical physics — i.e. non-quantum physics —, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: gives very inaccurate predictions.) If the trend towards ever faster, more, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: compact computer hardware is to continue, the technology must become, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: even more ‘quantum-mechanical’ in this sense, simply because quantum-, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Let me elaborate that claim. The earliest inventions for harnessing nature, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: were tools powered by human muscles. They revolutionized our ancestors’, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: situation, but they suffered from the limitation that they required continuous, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: human attention and effort during every moment of their use. Subsequent, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: technology overcame that limitation: human beings managed to domesticate, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: certain animals and plants, turning the biological adaptations in those, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: organisms to human ends. Thus the crops could grow, and the guard dogs, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: could watch, even while their owners slept. Another new type of technology, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: began when human beings went beyond merely exploiting existing, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: adaptations (and existing non-biological phenomena such as fire), and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: created completely new adaptations in the world, in the form of pottery,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: bricks, wheels, metal artefacts and machines. To do this they had to think, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: about, and understand, the natural laws governing the world — including, as, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: I have explained, not only its superficial aspects but the underlying fabric of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: technology — harnessing some of the materials, forces and energies of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: physics. In the twentieth century information was added to this list when the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: invention of computers allowed complex information processing to be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: performed outside human brains. Quantum computation, which is now in its, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: technology that allows useful tasks to be performed in collaboration between, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: and then sharing the results., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: I have already mentioned the significance of computational universality —, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the fact that a single physically possible computer can, given enough time, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and memory, perform any computation that any other physically possible, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: computer can perform. The laws of physics as we currently know them do, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: admit computational universality. However, to be at all useful or significant in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the overall scheme of things, universality as I have defined it up to now is not, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: sufficient. It merely means that the universal computer can eventually do, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: what any other computer can. In other words, given enough time it is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: universal. But what if it is not given enough time? Imagine a universal, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: computer that could execute only one computational step in the whole, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: lifetime of the universe. Would its universality still be a profound property of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: reality? Presumably not. To put that more generally, one can criticize this, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: narrow notion of universality because it classifies a task as being in a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: computer’s repertoire regardless of the physical resources that the computer, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: would expend in performing the task. Thus, for instance, we have, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: considered a virtual-reality user who is prepared to go into suspended, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: animation for billions of years, while the computer calculates what to show, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: next. In discussing the ultimate limits of virtual reality, that is the appropriate, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: attitude for us to take. But when we are considering the usefulness of virtual, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: reality — or what is even more important, the fundamental role that it plays in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the fabric of reality — we must be more discriminating. Evolution would, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: never have got off the ground if the task of rendering certain properties of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the earliest, simplest habitats had not been tractable (that is, computable in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: a reasonable time) using readily available molecules as computers., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Likewise, science and technology would never have got off the ground if, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: designing a stone tool had required a thousand years of thinking. Moreover,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: what was true at the beginning has remained an absolute condition for, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: progress at every step. Computational universality would not be much use to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: genes, no matter how much knowledge they contained, if rendering their, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: organism were an intractable task — say, if one reproductive cycle took, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: billions of years., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Thus the fact that there are complex organisms, and that there has been a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: succession of gradually improving inventions and scientific theories (such as, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Galilean mechanics, Newtonian mechanics, Einsteinian mechanics, quantum, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mechanics,…) tells us something more about what sort of computational, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: universality exists in reality. It tells us that the actual laws of physics are,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: thus far at least, capable of being successively approximated by theories, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that give ever better explanations and predictions, and that the task of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: discovering each theory, given the previous one, has been computationally, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: tractable, given the previously known laws and the previously available, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: technology. The fabric of reality must be, as it were, layered, for easy self-, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: access. Likewise, if we think of evolution itself as a computation, it tells us, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that there have been sufficiently many viable organisms, coded for by DNA,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: to allow better-adapted ones to be computed (i.e. to evolve) using the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: resources provided by their worse-adapted predecessors. So we can infer, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that the laws of physics, in addition to mandating their own comprehensibility, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: through the Turing principle, ensure that the corresponding evolutionary, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: processes, such as life and thought, are neither too time-consuming nor, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: require too many resources of any other kind to occur in reality., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: So, the laws of physics not only permit (or, as I have argued, require) the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: existence of life and thought, they require them to be, in some appropriate, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: sense, efficient. To express this crucial property of reality, modern analyses, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of universality usually postulate computers that are universal in an even, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: stronger sense than the Turing principle would, on the face of it, require: not, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: only are universal virtual-reality generators possible, it is possible to build, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: them so that they do not require impracticably large resources to render, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: simple aspects of reality. From now on, when I refer to universality I shall, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mean it in this sense, unless otherwise stated., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Just how efficiently can given aspects of reality be rendered? What, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: computations, in other words, are practicable in a given time and under a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: given budget? This is the basic question of computational complexity theory, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: which, as I have said, is the study of the resources that are required to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: perform given computational tasks. Complexity theory has not yet been, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: sufficiently well integrated with physics to give many quantitative answers., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: However, it has made a fair amount of headway in defining a useful, rough-, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and-ready distinction between tractable and intractable computational tasks., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: The general approach is best illustrated by an example. Consider the task of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: multiplying together two rather large numbers, say 4,220,851 and 2,594,209., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Many of us remember the method we learned in childhood for performing, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: such multiplications. It involves multiplying each digit of one number in turn, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: by each digit of the other, while shifting and adding the results together in a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: standard way to give the final answer, in this case 10,949,769,651,859., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Many might be loath to concede that this wearisome procedure makes, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: multiplication ‘tractable’ in any ordinary sense of the word. (Actually there are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: more efficient methods for multiplying large numbers, but this one provides a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: good enough illustration.) But from the point of view of complexity theory,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: which deals in massive tasks carried out by computers that are not subject to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: boredom and almost never make mistakes, this method certainly does fall, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: into the ‘tractable’ category., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: What counts for ‘tractability’, according to the standard definitions, is not the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: actual time taken to multiply a particular pair of numbers, but the fact that the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: time does not increase too sharply when we apply the same method to ever, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: larger numbers. Perhaps surprisingly, this rather indirect way of defining, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: tractability work very well in practice for many (though not all) important, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: classes of computational tasks. For example, with multiplication we can, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: easily see that the standard method can be used to multiply numbers that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: are, say, about ten times as large, with very little extra work. Suppose, for, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the sake of argument, that each elementary multiplication of one digit by, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: another takes a certain computer one microsecond (including the time taken, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to perform the additions, shift and other operations that follow each, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: elementary multiplication. When we are multiplying the seven-digit numbers, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: 4,220,851 an 2,594,209, each of the seven digits in 4,220,851 has to be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: multiplied by each of the seven digits in 2,594,209. So the total time require, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: for the multiplication (if the operations are performed sequential) will be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: seven times seven, or 49 microseconds. For inputs rough ten times as large, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: as these, which would have eight digits each, the time required to multiply, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: them would be 64 microseconds, an increase of only 31 per cent., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Clearly, numbers over a huge range — certainly including any numbers that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: have ever been measured as the values of physical variables — can be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: multiplied in a tiny fraction of a second. So multiplication is indeed tractable, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: for all purposes within physics (or, at least, within existing physics)., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Admittedly, practical reasons for multiplying much larger numbers can arise, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: outside physics. For instance, products of prime numbers of 125 digits or so, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: are of great interest to cryptographers. Our hypothetical machine could, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: multiply two such prime numbers together, making a 250-digit product, in just, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: over a hundredth of a second. In one second it could multiply two 1000-digit, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: numbers, and real computers available today can easily improve upon those, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: timings. Only a few researchers in esoteric branches of pure mathematics, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: are interested in performing such incomprehensibly vast multiplications, yet, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: we see that even they have no reason to regard multiplication as intractable., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: By contrast, factorization, essentially the reverse of multiplication, seems, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: much more difficult. One starts with a single number as input, say, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: 10,949,769,651,859, and the task is to find two factors — smaller numbers, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: which when multiplied together make 10,949,769,651,859. Since we have, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: just multiplied them, we know that the answer in this case is 4,220,851 and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: 2,594,209 (and since those are both primes, it is the only correct answer)., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: But without such inside knowledge, how would we have found the factors?, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: You will search your childhood memories in vain for an easy method, for, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: there isn’t one., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: The most obvious method of factorization is to divide the input number by all, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: possible factors, starting with 2 and continuing with every odd number, until, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: one of them divides the input exactly. At least one of the factors (assuming, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the input is not a prime) can be no larger than the input’s square root, and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that provides an estimate of how long the method might take. In the case we, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: are considering, our computer would find the smaller of the two factors,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: 2,594,209, in just over a second. However, an input ten times as large would, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: have a square root that was about three times as large, so factorizing it by, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: this method would take up to three times as long. In other words, adding one, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: digit to the input would now triple the running time. Adding another would, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: triple it again, and so on. So the running time would increase in geometrical, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: proportion, that is, exponentially, with the number of digits in the number we, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: are factorizing. Factorizing a number with 25-digit factors by this method, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: would occupy all the computers on Earth for centuries., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: The method can be improved upon, but all methods of factorization currently, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: in use have this exponential-increase property. The largest number that has, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: been factorized ‘in anger’, as it were — a number whose factors were, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: secretly chosen by mathematicians in order to present a challenge to other, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mathematicians — had 129 digits. The factorization was achieved, after an, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: appeal on the Internet, by a global cooperative effort involving thousands of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: computers. The computer scientist Donald Knuth has estimated that the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: factorization of a 250-digit number, using the most efficient known methods,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: would take over a million years on a network of a million computers. Such, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: things are difficult to estimate, but even if Knuth is being too pessimistic one, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: need only consider numbers with a few more digits and the task will be made, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: many times harder. This is what we mean by saying that the factorization of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: large numbers is intractable. All this is a far cry from multiplication where, as, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: we have seen, the task of multiplying a pair of 250-digit numbers is a triviality, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: on anyone’s home computer. No one can even conceive of how one might, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: factorize thousand-digit numbers, or million-digit numbers., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: At least, no one could conceive of it, until recently., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: In 1982 the physicist Richard Feynman considered the computer simulation, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of quantum-mechanical objects. His starting-point was something that had, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: already been known for some time without its significance being appreciated,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: namely that predicting the behaviour of quantum-mechanical systems (or, as, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: we can describe it, rendering quantum-mechanical environments in virtual, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: reality) is in general an intractable task. One reason why the significance of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: this had not been appreciated is that no one expected the computer, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: prediction of interesting physical phenomena to be especially easy. Take, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: weather forecasting or earthquake prediction, for instance. Although the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: relevant equations are known, the difficulty of applying them in realistic, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: situations is notorious. This has recently been brought to public attention in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: popular books and articles on chaos and the ‘butterfly effect’. These effects, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: are not responsible for the intractability that Feynman had in mind, for the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: simple reason that they occur only in classical physics — that is, not in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: reality, since reality is quantum-mechanical. Nevertheless, I want to make, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: some remarks here about ‘chaotic’ classical motions, if only to highlight the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: quite different characters of classical and quantum unpredictability., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Chaos theory is about limitations on predictability in classical physics,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: stemming from the fact that almost all classical systems are inherently, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: unstable. The ‘instability’ in question has nothing to do with any tendency to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: behave violently or disintegrate. It is about an extreme sensitivity to initial, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: conditions. Suppose that we know the present state of some physical, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: system, such as a set of billiard balls rolling on a table. If the system obeyed, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: classical physics, as it does to a good approximation, we should then be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: able to determine its future behaviour — say, whether a particular ball will go, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: into a pocket or not — from the relevant laws of motion, just as we can, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: predict an eclipse or a planetary conjunction from the same laws. But in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: practice we are never able to measure the initial positions and velocities, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: perfectly. So the question arises, if we know them to some reasonable, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: degree of accuracy, can we also predict to a reasonable degree of accuracy, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: how they will behave in the future? And the answer is, usually, that we, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: cannot. The difference between the real trajectory and the predicted, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: trajectory, calculated from slightly inaccurate data, tends to grow, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: exponentially and irregularly (‘chaotically’) with time, so that after a while the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: original, slightly imperfectly known state is no guide at all to what the system, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: is doing. The implication for computer prediction is that planetary motions,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the epitome of classical predictability, are untypical classical systems. In, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: order to predict what a typical classical system will do after only a moderate, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: period, one would have to determine its initial state to an impossibly high, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: precision. Thus it is said that in principle, the flap of a butterfly’s wing in one, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: hemisphere of the planet could cause a hurricane in the other hemisphere., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: The infeasibility of weather forecasting and the like is then attributed to the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: impossibility of accounting for every butterfly on the planet., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: However, real hurricanes and real butterflies obey quantum theory, not, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: classical mechanics. The instability that would rapidly amplify slight mis-, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: specifications of an initial classical state is simply not a feature of quantum-, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mechanical systems. In quantum mechanics, small deviations from a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: specified initial state tend to cause only small deviations from the predicted, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: final state. Instead, accurate prediction is made difficult by quite a different, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: effect., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: The laws of quantum mechanics require an object that is initially at a given, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: position (in all universes) to ‘spread out’ in the multiverse sense. For, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: instance, a photon and its other-universe counterparts all start from the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: same point on a glowing filament, but then move in trillions of different, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: directions. When we later make a measurement of what has happened, we, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: too become differentiated as each copy of us sees what has happened in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: our particular universe. If the object in question is the Earth’s atmosphere,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: then a hurricane may have occurred in 30 per cent of universes, say, and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: not in the remaining 70 per cent. Subjectively we perceive this as a single,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: unpredictable or ‘random’ outcome, though from the multi-verse point of view, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: all the outcomes have actually happened. This parallel-universe multiplicity, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: is the real reason for the unpredictability of the weather. Our inability to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: measure the initial conditions accurately is completely irrelevant. Even if we, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: knew the initial conditions perfectly, the multiplicity, and therefore the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: unpredictability of the motion, would remain. And on the other hand, in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: contrast to the classical case, an imaginary multiverse with only slightly, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: different initial conditions would not behave very differently from the real, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: multiverse: it might suffer hurricanes in 30.000001 per cent of its universes, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and not in the remaining 69.999 999 per cent., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: The flapping of butterflies’ wings does not, in reality, cause hurricanes, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: because the classical phenomenon of chaos depends on perfect, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: determinism, which does not hold in any single universe. Consider a group, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of identical universes at an instant at which, in all of them, a particular, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: butterfly’s wings have flapped up. Consider a second group of universes, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: which at the same instant are identical to the first group, except that in them, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the butterfly’s wings are down. Wait for a few hours. Quantum mechanics, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: watching the butterfly and pressing a button to detonate a nuclear bomb if it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: flaps its wings), the two groups of universes, nearly identical at first, are still, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: nearly identical. But each group, within itself, has become greatly, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: differentiated. It includes universes with hurricanes, universes without, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: hurricanes, and even a very tiny number of universes in which the butterfly, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: has spontaneously changed its species through an accidental, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: rearrangement of all its atoms, or the Sun has exploded because all its, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: atoms bounced by chance towards the nuclear reaction at its core. Even so,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the two groups still resemble each other very closely. In the universes in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: which the butterfly raised its wings and hurricanes occurred, those, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: hurricanes were indeed unpredictable; but the butterfly was not causally, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: responsible, for there were near-identical hurricanes in universes where, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: everything else was the same but the wings were lowered., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: It is perhaps worth stressing the distinction between unpredictability and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: intractability. Unpredictability has nothing to do with the available, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: computational resources. Classical systems are unpredictable (or would be,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: if they existed) because of their sensitivity to initial conditions. Quantum, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: systems do not have that sensitivity, but are unpredictable because they, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: behave differently in different universes, and so appear random in most, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: universes. In neither case will any amount of computation lessen the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: unpredictability. Intractability, by contrast, is a computational-resource issue., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: It refers to a situation where we could readily make the prediction if only we, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: could perform the required computation, but we cannot do so because the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: resources required are impractically large. In order to disentangle the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: problems of unpredictability from those of intractability in quantum, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mechanics, we have to consider quantum systems that are, in principle,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: predictable., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Quantum theory is often presented as making only probabilistic predictions., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: For example, in the perforated-barrier-and-screen type of interference, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: experiment described in Chapter 2, the photon can be observed to arrive, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: anywhere in the ‘bright’ part of the shadow pattern. But it is important to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: understand that for many other experiments quantum theory predicts a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: single, definite outcome. In other words, it predicts that all universes will end, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: up with the same outcome, even if the universes differed at intermediate, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: stages of the experiment, and it predicts what that outcome will be. In such, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: cases we observe non-random interference phenomena. An interferometer, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: can demonstrate such phenomena. This is an optical instrument that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: consists mainly of mirrors, both conventional mirrors (Figure 9.1) and semi-, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: silvered mirrors (as used in conjuring tricks and police stations and shown in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Figure 9.2.). If a photon strikes a semi-silvered mirror, then in half the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: universes it bounces off just as it would from a conventional mirror. But in the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: A single photon enters the interferometer at the top left, as shown in Figure, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: 9.3. In all the universes in which the experiment is done, the photon and its, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: counterparts are travelling towards the interferometer along the same path., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: These universes are therefore identical. But as soon as the photon strikes, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the semi-silvered mirror, the initially identical universes become, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: differentiated. In half of them, the photon passes straight through and travels, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: along the top side of the interferometer. In the remaining universes, it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: bounces off the mirror and travels down the left side of the interferometer., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: The versions of the photon in these two groups of universes then strike and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: bounce off the ordinary mirrors at the top right and bottom left respectively., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Thus they end up arriving simultaneously at the semi-silvered mirror on the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: bottom right, and interfere with one another. Remember that we have, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: allowed only one photon into the apparatus, and in each universe there is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: still only one photon in here. In all universes, that photon has now struck the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: bottom-right mirror. In half of them it has struck it from the left, and in the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: other half it has struck it from above. The versions of the photon in these two, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: groups of universes interfere strongly. The net effect depends on the exact, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: geometry of the situation, but Figure 9.3 shows the case where in all, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: universes the photon ends up taking the rightward-pointing path through the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mirror, and in no universe is it transmitted or reflected downwards. Thus all, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: incompatible with either of the two possible paths that a particle in a single, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: universe might have taken. If we project a photon rightwards along the lower, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: arm of the interferometer, for instance, it may pass through the semi-silvered, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mirror like the photon in the interference experiment does. But it may not —, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: sometimes it is deflected downwards. Likewise, a photon projected, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: downwards along the right arm may be deflected rightwards, as in the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: interference experiment, or it may just travel straight down. Thus, whichever, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: path you set a single photon on inside the apparatus, it will emerge, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: randomly. Only when interference occurs between the two paths is the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: outcome predictable. It follows that what is present in the apparatus just, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: before the end of the interference experiment cannot be a single photon on a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: single path: it cannot, for instance, be just a photon travelling on the lower, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: downwards. Nor can there be just a photon travelling on the right arm; again,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: something else must be there, preventing it from travelling straight down, as, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: it sometimes would if it were there by itself. Just as with shadows, we can, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: construct further experiments to show that the ‘something else’ has all the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: properties of a photon that travels along the other path and interferes with, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the photon we see, but with nothing else in our universe., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Since there are only two different kinds of universe in this experiment, the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: calculation of what will happen takes only about twice as long as it would if, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the particle obeyed classical laws — say, if we were computing the path of a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: billard ball. A factor of two will hardly make such computations intractable., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: However, we have already seen that multiplicity of a much larger degree is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: fairly easy to achieve. In the shadow experiments, a single photon passes, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: through a barrier in which there are some small holes, and then falls on a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: screen. Suppose that there are a thousand holes in the barrier. There are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: places on the screen where the photon can fall (does fall, in some, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: universes), and places where it cannot fall. To calculate whether a particular, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: point on the screen can or cannot ever receive the photon, we must, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: calculate the mutual interference effects of a thousand parallel-universe, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: versions of the photon. Specifically, we have to calculate one thousand, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: paths from the barrier to the given point on the screen, and then calculate, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the effects of those photons on each other so as to determine whether or not, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: they are all prevented from reaching that point. Thus we must perform, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: The complexity of this sort of computation shows us that there is a lot more, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: happening in a quantum-mechanical environment than — literally — meets, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the eye. And I have argued, expressing Dr Johnson’s criterion for reality in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: terms of computational complexity, that this complexity is the core reason, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: why it does not make sense to deny the existence of the rest of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: multiverse. But far higher multiplicities are possible when there are two or, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: more interacting particles involved in an interference phenomenon. Suppose, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that each of two interacting particles has (say) a thousand paths open to it., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: The pair can then be in a million different states at an intermediate stage of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the experiment, so there can be up to a million universes that differ in what, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: this pair of particles is doing. If three particles were interacting, the number, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of different universes could be a billion; for four, a trillion; and so on. Thus, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the number of different histories that we have to calculate if we want to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: predict what will happen in such cases increases exponentially with the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: number of interacting particles. That is why the task of computing how a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: typical quantum system will behave is well and truly intractable., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: This is the intractability that was exercising Feynman. We see that it has, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: nothing to do with unpredictability: on the contrary, it is most clearly, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: manifested in quantum phenomena that are highly predictable. That is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: because in such phenomena the same, definite outcome occurs in all, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: universes, but that outcome is the result of interference between vast, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: numbers of universes that were different during the experiment. All this is in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: principle predictable from quantum theory and is not overly sensitive to the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: initial conditions. What makes it hard to predict that in such experiments the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: outcome will always be the same is that doing so requires inordinately large, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: amounts of computation., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: rendering of a roulette wheel need not — indeed should not — give the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: same sequence of numbers as the real one. Similarly, we cannot prepare in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: advance a virtual-reality rendering of tomorrow’s weather. But we can (or, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: shall, one day, be able to) make a rendering of weather which, though not, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the same as the real weather conditions prevailing on any historical day, is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: nevertheless so realistic in its behaviour that no user, however expert, will be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: able to distinguish it from genuine weather. The same is true of any, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: environment that does not show the effects of quantum interference (which, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: means most environments). Rendering such an environment in virtual reality, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: is a tractable computational task. However, it would appear that no practical, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: rendering is possible for environments that do show the effects of quantum, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: because of some interference phenomenon?, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: It might seem natural to conclude that reality does not, after all, display, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: genuine computational universality, because interference phenomena, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: cannot be usefully rendered. Feynman, however, correctly drew the opposite, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: conclusion! Instead of regarding the intractability of the task of rendering, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: quantum phenomena as an obstacle Feynman regarded it as an opportunity., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: If it requires so much computation to work out what will happen in an, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: interference experiment, then the very act of setting up such an experiment, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and measuring its outcome is tantamount to performing a complex, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: computation. Thus, Feynman reasoned, it might after all be possible to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: render quantum environments efficiently, provided the computer were, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: allowed to perform experiments on a real quantum-mechanical object. The, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: computer would choose what measurements to make on an auxiliary piece, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of quantum hardware as it went along, and would incorporate the results of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the measurements into its computations., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: The auxiliary quantum hardware would in effect be a computer too. For, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: example, an interferometer could act as such a device and, like any other, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: physical object, it can be thought of as a computer. We would nowadays call, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: it a special-purpose quantum computer. We ‘program’ it by setting up the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mirrors in a certain geometry, and then projecting a single photon at the first, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mirror. In a non-random interference experiment the photon will always, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: emerge in one particular direction, determined by the settings of the mirrors,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and we could interpret that direction as indicating the result of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: computation. In a more complex experiment, with several interacting, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: particles, such a computation could easily, as I have explained, become, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘intractable’. Yet since we could readily obtain its result just by performing, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: this experiment, it is not really intractable after all. We must now be more, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: careful with our terminology. Evidently there are computational tasks that are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘intractable’ if we attempt to perform them using any existing computer, but, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: which would be tractable if we were to use quantum-mechanical objects as, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: special-purpose computers. (Notice that the fact that quantum phenomena, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: can be used to perform computations in this way depends on their not being, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: subject to chaos. If the outcome of computations were an inordinately, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: sensitive function of the initial state, ‘programming’ the device by setting it in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: a suitable initial state would be an impossibly difficult task.), Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Using a quantum auxiliary device in this way might be considered cheating,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: since any environment is obviously much easier to render if one has access, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to a spare copy of it to measure during the rendering! However, Feynman, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: conjectured that it would not be necessary to use a literal copy of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: environment being rendered: that it would be possible to find a much more, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: easily constructed auxiliary device whose interference properties were, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: nevertheless analogous to those of the target environment. Then a normal, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: computer could do the rest of the rendering, working through the analogy, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: between the auxiliary device and the target environment. And, Feynman, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: expected, that would be a tractable task. Furthermore, he conjectured,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: correctly as it turned out, that all the quantum-mechanical properties of any, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: target environment could be simulated by auxiliary devices of a particular, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: type that he specified (namely an array of spinning atoms, each interacting, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: with its neighbours). He called the whole class of such devices a universal, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: quantum simulator., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: But it was not a single machine, as it would have to be in order to qualify as, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: a universal computer. The interactions that the simulator’s atoms would have, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to undergo could not be fixed once and for all, as in a universal computer,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: but would have to be re-engineered for the simulation of each target, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: environment. But the point of universality is that it should be possible to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: program single machine, specified once and for all, to perform any possible, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: computation, or render any physically possible environment. In 1985 I, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: proved that under quantum physics there is a universal quantum computer., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: The proof was fairly straightforward. All I had to do was mimic Turing’s, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: constructions, but using quantum theory to define the underlying physics, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: instead of the classical mechanics that Turing had implicitly assumed. A, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: universal quantum computer could perform any computation that any other, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: quantum computer (or any Turing-type computer) could perform, and it could, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: render any finite physically possible environment in virtual reality. Moreover,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: it has since been shown that the time and other resources that it would need, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to do these things would not increase exponentially with the size or detail of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the environment being rendered, so the relevant computations would be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: tractable by the standards of complexity theory., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: The classical theory of computation, which was the unchallenged foundation, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of computing for half a century, is now obsolete except, like the rest of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: classical physics, as an approximation scheme. The theory of computation is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: now the quantum theory of computation. I said that Turing had implicitly, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: used ‘classical mechanics’ in his construction. But with the benefit of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: hindsight we can now see that even the classical theory of computation did, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: not fully conform to classical physics, and contained strong adumbrations of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: quantum theory. It is no coincidence that the word bit, meaning the smallest, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: possible amount of information that a computer can manipulate, means, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: essentially the same as quantum, a discrete chunk. Discrete variables, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: (variables that cannot take a continuous range of values) are alien to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: classical physics. For example, if a variable has only two possible values,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: say 0 and 1, how does it ever get from 0 to 1? (I asked this question in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Chapter 2.) In classical physics it would have to jump discontinuously, which, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: is incompatible with how forces and motions work in classical mechanics. In, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: quantum physics, no discontinuous change is necessary — even though all, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: measurable quantities are discrete. It works as follows., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Let us start by imagining some parallel universes stacked like a pack of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: cards, with the pack as a whole representing the multiverse. (Such a model,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: in which the universes are arranged in a sequence, greatly understates the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: complexity of the multiverse, but it suffices to illustrate my point here.) Now, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: let us alter the model to take account of the fact that the multiverse is not a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: discrete set of universes but a continuum, and that not all the universes are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: different. In fact, for each universe that is present there is also a continuum, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of identical universes present, comprising a certain tiny but non-zero, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: proportion of the multiverse. In our model, this proportion may be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: represented by the thickness of a card, where each card now represents all, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: the universes of a given type. However, unlike the thickness of a card, the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: proportion of each type of universe changes with time under quantum-, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mechanical laws of motion. Consequently, the proportion of universes having, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: a given property also changes, and it changes continuously. In the case of a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: discrete variable changing from 0 to 1, suppose that the variable has the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: value 0 in all universes before the change begins, and that after the change,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: it has the value 1 in all universes. During the change, the proportion of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: that is merely a limitation of the diagram, and not a real feature of what is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: happening. Although the diagram makes it seem that there is at each instant, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: a particular universe that ‘has just changed’ from 0 to 1 because it has just, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘crossed the boundary’, that is not really so. It cannot be, because such a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: universe is strictly identical with every other universe in which the bit has, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: value 1 at that time. So if the inhabitants of one of them were experiencing a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: discontinuous change, then so would the inhabitants of all the others., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: Another way in which quantum physics is implicit in classical computation is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that all practical implementations of Turing-type computers rely on such, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: things as solid matter or magnetized materials, which could not exist in the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: absence of quantum-mechanical effects. For example, any solid body, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: consists of an array of atoms, which are themselves composed of electrically, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: charged particles (electrons, and protons in the nuclei). But because of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: classical chaos, no array of charged particles could be stable under classical, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: laws of motion. The positively and negatively charged particles would simply, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: move out of position and crash into each other, and the structure would, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: disintegrate. It is only the strong quantum interference between the various, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: paths taken by charged particles in parallel universes that prevents such, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: catastrophes and makes solid matter possible., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: Building a universal quantum computer is well beyond present technology., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: As I have said, detecting an interference phenomenon always involves, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: setting up an appropriate interaction between all the variables that have, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: been different in the universes that contribute to the interference. The more, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: interacting particles are involved, therefore, the harder it tends to be to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: engineer the interaction that would display the interference — that is, the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: result of the computation. Among the many technical difficulties of working at, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the level of a single atom or single electron, one of the most important is that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of preventing the environment from being affected by the different interfering, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: sub-computations. For if a group of atoms is undergoing an interference, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: phenomenon, and they differentially affect other atoms in the environment,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: then the interference can no longer be detected by measurements of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: original group alone, and the group is no longer performing any useful, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: quantum computation. This is called decoherence. I must add that this, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: problem is often presented the wrong way round: we are told that ‘quantum, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: interference is a very delicate process, and must be shielded from all outside, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: influences’. This is wrong. Outside influences could cause minor, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: imperfections, but it is the effect of the quantum computation on the outside, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: world that causes decoherence., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Thus the race is on to engineer sub-microscopic systems in which, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: information-carrying variables interact among themselves, but affect their, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: environment as little as possible. Another novel simplification, unique to the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: quantum theory of computation, partly offsets the difficulties caused by, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: decoherence. It turns out that, unlike classical computation, where one, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: needs to engineer specific classical logic elements such as and, or and not,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: Interference phenomena involving vast numbers of particles, such I as, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: superconductivity and superfluidity, are known, but it seems that none of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: them can be used to perform any interesting computations. At the time of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: writing, only single-bit quantum computations can be easily performed in the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: laboratory. Experimentalists are confident, however, that two- and higher-bit, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: quantum gates (the quantum equivalent of the classical logical elements) will, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: be constructed within the next few years. These are the basic components of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: quantum computers. Some physicists, notably Rolf Landauer of IBM, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Research, are pessimistic about the prospects for further advances after, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that. They believe that decoherence will never be reduced to the point where, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: more than a few consecutive quantum-computational steps can be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: performed. Most researcher in the field are much more optimistic (though, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: perhaps that is because only optimistic researchers choose to work on, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: quantum computation!). Some special-purpose quantum computers have, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: already been built (see below), and my own opinion is that more complex, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: The fact that the repertoire of the universal quantum computer contains, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: environments whose rendering is classically intractable implies that new, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: classes of purely mathematical computations must have become tractable, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: too. For the laws of physics are, as Galileo said, expressed in mathematical, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: language, and rendering an environment is tantamount to evaluating certain, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mathematical functions. And indeed, many mathematical tasks have now, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: been discovered which could be efficiently performed by quantum, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: computation where all known classical methods are intractable. The most, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: spectacular of these is the task of factorizing large numbers. The method,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: known as Shor’s algorithm, was discovered in 1994 by Peter Shor of Bell, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Laboratories. (While this book was in proof further spectacular quantum, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: algorithms have been discovered, including Graver’s algorithm for searching, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: long lists very rapidly.), Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Shor’s algorithm is extraordinarily simple and requires far more modest, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: hardware than would be needed for a universal quantum computer. It is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: likely, therefore, that a quantum factorization engine will be built long before, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the full range of quantum computations is technologically feasible. This is a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: prospect of great significance for cryptography (the science of securely, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: communicating and authenticating information). Realistic communication, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: networks may be global and have large, constantly changing sets of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: participants with unpredictable patterns of communication. It is impractical to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: require every pair of participants, physically and in advance, to exchange, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: secret cryptographic keys that would allow them later to communicate, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: without fear of eavesdroppers. Public-key cryptography is any method of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: sending secret information where the sender and recipient do not already, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: share any secret information. The most secure known method of public-key, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: cryptography depends on the intractability of the problem of factorizing large, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: numbers. This method is known as the RSA cryptosystem, named after, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Ronald Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adelman, who first proposed it in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: 1978. It depends on a mathematical procedure whereby a message can be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: encoded using a large (say, 250-digit) number as a key. The recipient can, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: freely make this key public, because any message encoded with it can only, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: be decoded given a knowledge of the factors of that number. Thus I can, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: choose two 125-digit prime numbers and keep them secret, but multiply, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: them together and make their 250-digit product public. Anyone can send me, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: a message using that number as the key, but only I can read the messages, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: because only I know the secret factors., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: As I have said, there is no practical prospect of factorizing 250-digit numbers, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: by classical means. But a quantum factorization engine running Shor’s, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: algorithm could do it using only a few thousand arithmetic operations, which, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: might well take only a matter of minutes. So anyone with access to such a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: machine would easily be able to read any intercepted message that had, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: been encrypted using the RSA cryptosystem., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: It would do the cryptographers no good to choose larger numbers as keys, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: because the resources required by Shor’s algorithm increase only slowly, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: with the size of the number being factorized. In the quantum theory of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: computation, factorization is a very tractable task. It is thought that, in the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: presence of a given level of decoherence, there would again be a practical, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: limit on the size of number that could be factorized, but there is no known, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: lower limit on the rate of decoherence that can be technologically achieved., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: So we must conclude that one day in the future, at a time that cannot now be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: predicted, the RSA cryptosystem with any given length of key may become, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: insecure. In a certain sense, that makes it insecure even today. For anyone,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: or any organization, that records an RSA-encrypted message today, and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: waits until they can buy a quantum factorization engine with low enough, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: decoherence, will be able to decode the message. That may not happen for, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: centuries, or it may be only decades — perhaps less, who can tell? But the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: likelihood that it will be rather a long time is all that now remains of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: former complete security of the RSA system., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: When a quantum factorization engine is factorizing a 250-digit number, the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: number of interfering universes will be of the order of 10 500 — that is, ten to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the power of 500. This staggeringly large number is the reason why Shor’s, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: algorithm makes factorization tractable. I said that the algorithm requires, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: only a few thousand arithmetic operations. I meant, of course, a few, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: thousand operations in each universe that contributes to the answer. All, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: those computations are performed in parallel, in different universes, and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: share their results through interference., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: You may be wondering how we can persuade our counterparts in 10 500-, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: odd universes to start working on our factorization task. Will they not have, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: their own agendas for the use of their computers? No — and no persuasion, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: is necessary. Shor’s algorithm operates initially only on a set of universes, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that are identical to one another, and it causes them to become, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: differentiated only within the confines of the factorization engine. So we, who, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: specified the number to be factorized, and who wait while the answer is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: computed, are identical in all the interfering universes. There are, no doubt,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: many other universes in which we programmed different numbers or never, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: built the factorization engine at all. But those universes differ from ours in too, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: many variables — or more precisely, in variables that are not made to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: interact in the right way by the programming of Shor’s algorithm — and so do, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: not interfere with our universe., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: The argument of Chapter 2, applied to any interference phenomenon, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: destroys the classical idea that there is only one universe. Logically, the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: possibility of complex quantum computations adds nothing to a case that is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: already unanswerable. But it does add psychological impact. With Shor’s, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: algorithm, the argument has been writ very large. To those who still cling to a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: single-universe world-view, I issue this challenge: explain how Shor’s, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: algorithm works.  I do not merely mean predict that it will work, which is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: merely a matter of solving a few uncontroversial equations. I mean provide, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: an explanation. When Shor’s algorithm has factorized a number, using 10 , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: 500  or so times the computational resources that can be seen to be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: present, where was the number factorized? There are only about 10 80 , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: atoms in the entire visible universe, an utterly miniscule number compared, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: with 10 500 . So if the visible universe were the extent of physical reality,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: physical reality would not even remotely contain the resources required to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: factorize such a large number. Who did factorize it, then? How, and where,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: was the computation performed?, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: I have been discussing traditional types of mathematical task that quantum, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: computers would be able to perform more quickly than existing machines., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: But there is an additional class of new tasks open to quantum computers, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that no classical computer could perform at all. By a strange coincidence,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: one of the first of these tasks to be discovered also concerns public-key, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: cryptography. This time it is not a matter of breaking an existing system, but, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of implementing a new, absolutely secure system of quantum cryptography., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: In 1989, at IBM Research, Yorktown Heights, New York, in the office of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theoretician Charles Bennett, the first working quantum computer was built., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: It was a special-purpose quantum computer consisting of a pair of quantum, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: cryptographic devices designed by Bennett and Gilles Brassard of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: University of Montreal. It became the first machine ever to perform non-trivial, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: computations that no Turing machine could perform., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: In Bennett and Brassard’s quantum cryptosystem, messages are encoded in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the states of individual photons emitted by a laser. Although many photons, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: are needed to transmit a message (one photon per bit, plus many more, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: photons wasted in various inefficiencies), the machines can be built with, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: existing technology because they need to perform their quantum, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: computations on only one photon at a time. The system’s security is based, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: not on intractability, either classical or quantum, but directly on the properties, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of quantum interference: that is what gives it its classically unobtainable, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: absolute security. No amount of future computation by any sort of computer,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: eavesdropper on quantum-encrypted messages: for if one communicates, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: through a medium exhibiting interference, one can detect eavesdroppers., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: According to classical physics, there is nothing that can prevent an, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: eavesdropper who has physical access to a communication medium, such, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: as a telephone line, from installing a passive listening device. But, as I have, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explained, if one makes any measurement on a quantum system one alters, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: its subsequent interference properties. The communication protocol relies on, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: this effect. The communicating parties effectively set up repeated, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: interference experiments, co-ordinating them over a public communication, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: channel. Only if the interference passes the test for there having been no, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: eavesdropper do they pass on to the next stage of the protocol, which is to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: use some of the transmitted information as a cryptographic key. At worst,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: persistent eavesdropper might prevent any communication from taking place, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: at all (though of course that is more easily achieved just by cutting the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: telephone line). But as for reading a message, only the intended recipient, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: can do that, and the guarantee of that is provided by the laws of physics., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Because quantum cryptography depends on manipulating individual, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: photons, it suffers from a major limitation. Each photon that is successfully, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: received, carrying one bit of the message, must somehow have been, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: transmitted intact from the transmitter to the receiver. But every method of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: transmission involves losses, and if these are too heavy the message will, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: never arrive. Setting up relay stations (which is the remedy for this problem, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: in existing communication systems) would compromise the security because, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: an eavesdropper could, without being detected, monitor what goes on inside, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the relay station. The best existing quantum-cryptographic systems use, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: fibre-optic cables and have a range of about ten kilometres. This would, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: suffice to provide, say, the financial district of a city with absolutely secure, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text:   , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: The laws of physics permit computers that can render every physically, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: possible environment without using impractically large resources. So, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: universal computation is not merely possible, as required by the Turing, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: principle, it is also tractable. Quantum phenomena may involve vast, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: numbers of parallel universes and therefore may not be capable of being, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: efficiently simulated within one universe. However, this strong form of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: universality still holds because quantum computers can efficiently render, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: every physically possible quantum environment, even when vast numbers of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: universes are interacting. Quantum computers can also efficiently solve, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: certain mathematical problems, such as factorization, which are classically, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: intractable, and can implement types of cryptography which are classically, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text:  The ‘fabric of reality’ that I have been describing so far has been the fabric, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of physical reality. Yet I have also referred freely to entities that are nowhere, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to be found in the physical world — abstractions such as numbers and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: infinite sets of computer programs. Nor are the laws of physics themselves, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: physical entities in the sense that rocks and planets are. As I have said,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Galileo’s ‘Book of Nature’ is only a metaphor. And then there are the fictions, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of virtual reality, the non-existent environments whose laws differ from the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: real laws of physics. Beyond those are what I have called the ‘Cantgotu’, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: environments, which cannot even be rendered in virtual reality. I have said, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that there exist infinitely many of those for every environment that can be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: rendered. But what does it mean to say that such environments ‘exist’? If, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: they do not exist in reality, or even in virtual reality, where do they exist?, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  Do abstract, non-physical entities exist? Are they part of the fabric of reality?, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: I am not interested here in issues of mere word usage. It is obvious that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: numbers, the laws of physics, and so on do ‘exist’ in some senses and not in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: others. The substantive question is this: how are we to understand such, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: entities? Which of them are merely convenient forms of words, referring, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ultimately only to ordinary, physical reality? Which are merely ephemeral, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: features of our culture? Which are arbitrary, like the rules of a trivial game, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that we need only look up? And which, if any, can be explained only in a way, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that attributes an independent existence to them? Things of this last type, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: must be part of the fabric of reality as defined in this book, because one, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: would have to understand them in order to understand everything that is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: understood., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: This suggests that we ought to apply Dr Johnson’s criterion again. If we want, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to know whether a given abstraction really exists, we should ask whether it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘kicks back’ in a complex, autonomous way. For example, mathematicians, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: characterize the ‘natural numbers’ 1, 2, 3,… in the first instance through a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: precise definition such as:, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:   , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: 1 is a natural number., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Each natural number has precisely one successor, which is also a natural, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: number., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: 1 is not the successor of any natural number., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Two natural numbers with the same successor are the same., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Such definitions are attempts to express abstractly the intuitive physical, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: notion of successive amounts of a discrete quantity. (More precisely, as I, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explained in the previous chapter, that notion is really quantum-mechanical.), Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: The operations of arithmetic, such as multiplication and addition, and further, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: concepts such as that of 1 prime number, are then defined with reference to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the ‘natural numbers’. But having created abstract ‘natural numbers’ through, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that definition, and having understood them through that intuition, we find, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that there is a lot more that we still do not understand about them. The, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: definition of a prime number fixes once and for all which numbers are primes, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and which are not. But the understanding of which numbers are prime — for, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: instance, how prime numbers are distributed on very large scales, how, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: clumped they are, how ‘random’ they are, and why — involves a wealth of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: new insights and new explanations. Indeed, it turns out that number theory is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: a whole world (the term is often used) in itself. To understand numbers more, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: fully we have to define many new classes of abstract entities, and postulate, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: many new structures and connections among those structures. We find that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: some of these abstract structures are related to other intuitions that we, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: already had but which, on the face of it, had nothing to do with numbers —, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: such as symmetry, rotation, the continuum, sets, infinity, and many more., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Thus, abstract mathematical entities we think we are familiar with can, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: nevertheless surprise or disappoint us. They can pop up unexpectedly in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: new guises, or disguises. They can be inexplicable, and then later conform, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to a new explanation. So they are complex and autonomous, and therefore, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: by Dr Johnson’s criterion we must conclude that they are real. Since we, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: cannot understand them either as being part of ourselves or as being part of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: something else that we already understand, but we can understand them as, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: independent entities, we must conclude that they are real, independent, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: entities., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Nevertheless, abstract entities are intangible. They do not kick back, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: physically in the sense that a stone does, so experiment and observation, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: cannot play quite the same role in mathematics as they do in science. In, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mathematics, proof plays that role. Dr Johnson’s stone kicked back by, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: making his foot rebound. Prime numbers kick back when we prove, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: something unexpected about them especially if we can go on to explain it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: too. In the traditional view, the crucial difference between proof and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: experiment is that a proof makes no reference to the physical world. We can, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: perform a proof in the privacy of our own minds, or we can perform a proof, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: trapped inside a virtual-reality generator rendering the wrong physics., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Provided only that we follow the rules of mathematical inference, we should, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: come up with the same answer as anyone else. And again, the prevailing, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: view is that, apart from the possibility of making blunders, when we have, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: proved something we know with absolute certainty that it is true., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Mathematicians are rather proud of this absolute certainty, and scientists, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: tend to be a little envious of it. For in science there is no way of being certain, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of any proposition. However well one’s theories explain existing, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: observations, at any moment someone may make a new, inexplicable, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: observation that casts doubt on the whole of the current explanatory, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: structure. Worse, someone may reach a better understanding that explains, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: not only all existing observations but also why the previous explanations, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: seemed to work but are nevertheless quite wrong. Galileo, for instance,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: found new explanation of the age-old observation that the ground beneath, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: our feet is at rest, an explanation that involved the ground actually moving., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Virtual reality — which can make one environment seem to be another —, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: underlines the fact that when observation is the ultimate arbiter between, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theories, there can never be any certainty that an existing explanation,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: however obvious, is even remotely true. But when proof is the arbiter, it is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: supposed, there can be certainty., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: It is said that the rules of logic were first formulated in the hope that they, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: would provide an impartial and infallible method of resolving all disputes., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: This hope can never be fulfilled. The study of logic itself revealed that the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: scope of logical deduction as a means of discovering the truth is severely, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: limited. Given substantive assumptions about the world, one can deduce, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: conclusions; but the conclusions are no more secure than the assumptions., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: The only repositions that logic can prove without recourse to assumptions, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: are tautologies — statements such as ‘all planets are planets’, which assert, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: nothing. In particular, all substantive questions of science lie outside the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: domain in which logic alone can settle disputes. But mathematics, it is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: supposed, lies inside that domain. Thus mathematicians seek absolute but, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: abstract truth, while scientists console themselves with the thought that they, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: can gain substantive and useful knowledge of the physical world. But they, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: must accept that this knowledge comes without guarantees. It is forever, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: tentative, forever fallible. The idea that science is characterized by, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘induction’, a method of justification which is supposed to be a slightly fallible, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: analogue of logical deduction, is an attempt to make the best of this, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: perceived second-class status of scientific knowledge. Instead of deductively, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: justified certainties, perhaps we can make do with inductively justified near-, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: certainties., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: As I have said, there is no such method of justification as ‘induction’. The, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: idea of reasoning one’s way to ‘near-certainty’ in science is myth. How could, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: I prove with ‘near-certainty’ that a wonderful new theory of physics,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: overturning my most unquestioned assumptions about reality, will not be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: published tomorrow? Or that I am in not inside a virtual-reality generator?, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: But all this is not to say that scientific knowledge is indeed ‘second-class’., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: For the idea that mathematics yields certainties is a myth too., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Since ancient times, the idea that mathematical knowledge has a privileged, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: status has often been associated with the idea that some abstract entities, at, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: least, are not merely part of the fabric of reality but are even more real than, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the physical world. Pythagoras believed that regularities in nature are the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: expression of mathematical relationships between natural numbers. ‘All, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: things are numbers’ was the slogan. This was not meant quite literally, but, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Plato went further and effectively denied that the physical world is real at all., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: He regarded our apparent experiences of it as worthless or misleading, and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: argued that the physical objects and phenomena we perceive are merely, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘shadows’ or imperfect imitations of their ideal essences (‘Forms’, or ‘Ideas’), Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: which exist in a separate realm that is the true reality. In that realm there, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: exist, among other things, the Forms of pure numbers such as 1, z, 3, …,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and the Forms of mathematical operations such as addition and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: multiplication. We may perceive some shadows of these Forms, as when we, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: place an apple on the table, and then another apple, and then see that there, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: are two apples. But the apples exhibit ‘one-ness’ and ‘two-ness’ (and, for, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that matter, ‘apple-ness’) only imperfectly. They are not perfectly identical, so, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: there are never really two of anything on the table. It might be objected that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the number two could also be represented by there being two different things, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: on the table. But such a representation is still imperfect because we must, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: then admit that there are cells that have fallen from the apples, and dust,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and air, on the table as well. Unlike Pythagoras, Plato had no particular axe, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to grind about the natural numbers. His reality contained the Forms of all, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: concepts. For example, it contained the Form of a perfect circle. The ‘circles’, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: we experience are never really circles. They are not perfectly round, nor, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: perfectly planar; they have a finite thickness; and so on. All of them are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: imperfect., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: Plato then pointed out a problem. Given all this Earthly imperfection (and, he, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: could have added, given our imperfect sensory access even to Earthly, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: circles), how can we possibly know what we know about real, perfect, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: circles? Evidently we do know about them, but how? Where did Euclid obtain, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the knowledge of geometry which he expressed in his famous axioms, when, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: no genuine circles, points or straight lines were available to him? Where, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: does the certainty of a mathematical proof come from, if no one can perceive, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the abstract entities that the proof refers to? Plato’s answer was that we do, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: not obtain our knowledge of such things from this world of shadow and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: illusion. Instead, we obtain it directly from the real world of Forms itself. We, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: have perfect inborn knowledge of that world which is, he suggests, forgotten, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: at birth, and then obscured by layers of errors caused by trusting our, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: senses. But reality can be remembered through the diligent application of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘reason’, which then yields the absolute certainty that experience can never, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: provide., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: I wonder whether anyone has ever believed this rather rickety fantasy, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: (including Plato himself, who was after all a very competent philosopher who, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: believed in telling ennobling lies to the public). However, the problem he, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: posed — of how we can possibly have knowledge, let alone certainty, of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: abstract entities — is real enough, and some elements of his proposed, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: solution have been part of the prevailing theory of knowledge ever since. In, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: particular, the core idea that mathematical knowledge and scientific, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: knowledge come from different sources, and that the ‘special’ source of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mathematics confers absolute certainty upon it, is to this day accepted, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: uncritically by virtually all mathematicians. Nowadays they call this source, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mathematical intuition, but it plays exactly the same role as Plato’s, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘memories’ of the realm of Forms., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: There have been many bitter controversies about precisely which types of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: perfectly reliable knowledge our mathematical intuition can be expected to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: reveal. In other words, mathematicians agree that mathematical intuition is a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: source of absolute certainty, but they cannot agree about what mathematical, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: intuition tells them! Obviously this is a recipe for infinite, unresolvable, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: controversy., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Inevitably, most such controversies have centred on the validity or otherwise, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of various methods of proof. One controversy concerned so-called, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘imaginary’ numbers. Imaginary numbers are the square roots of negative, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: numbers. New theorems about ordinary, ‘real’ numbers were proved by, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: appealing, at intermediate stages of a proof, to the properties of imaginary, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: numbers. For example, the first theorems about the distribution of prime, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: numbers were proved in this way. But some mathematicians objected to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: imaginary numbers on the grounds that they were not real. (Current, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: terminology still reflects the old controversy, even though we now think that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: imaginary numbers are just as real as ‘real’ numbers.) I expect that their, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: schoolteachers had told them that they were not allowed to take the square, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: root of minus one, and consequently they did not see why anyone else, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: should be allowed to. No doubt they called this uncharitable impulse, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘mathematical intuition’. But other mathematicians had different intuitions., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: They understood what the imaginary numbers were and how they fitted in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: with the real numbers. Why, they thought, should one not define new, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: abstract entities to have any properties one likes? Surely the only legitimate, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: grounds for forbidding this would be that the required properties were, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: logically inconsistent. (That is essentially the modern consensus which the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mathematician John Horton Conway has robustly referred to as the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘Mathematicians’ Liberation Movement’.) Admittedly, no one had proved that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the system of imaginary numbers was self-consistent. But then, no one had, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: proved that the ordinary arithmetic of the natural numbers was self-, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: consistent either., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: There were similar controversies over the validity of the use of infinite, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: numbers, and of sets containing infinitely many elements, and of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: infinitesimal quantities that were used in calculus. David Hilbert, the great, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: German mathematician who provided much of the mathematical, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: infrastructure of both the general theory of relativity and quantum theory,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: remarked that ‘the literature of mathematics is glutted with inanities and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: absurdities which have hail their source in the infinite’. Some, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mathematicians, as we shall see, denied the validity of reasoning about, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: infinite entities at all. The runaway success of pure mathematics during the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: nineteenth century had done little to resolve these controversies. On the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: contrary, it tended to intensify them and raise new ones. As mathematical, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: reasoning became more sophisticated, it inevitably moved ever further away, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: from everyday intuition, and this had two important, opposing effects. First,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mathematicians became more meticulous about proofs, which were, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: subjected to ever increasing standards or rigour before they were accepted., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: But second, more powerful methods of proof were invented which could not, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: always be validated by existing methods. And that often raised doubts as to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: whether a particular method of proof, however self-evident, was completely, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: infallible., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: So by about 1900 there was a crisis at the foundations of mathematics —, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: namely, that there were no foundations. But what had become of the laws of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: pure logic? Were they not supposed to resolve all disputes within the realm, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of mathematics? The embarrassing fact was that the ‘laws of pure logic’, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: were in effect what the disputes in mathematics were now about. Aristotle, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: had been the first to codify such laws in the fourth century BC, and so, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: founded what is today called proof theory. He assumed that a proof must, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: consist of a sequence of statements, starting with some premises and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: definitions and ending with the desired conclusion. For a sequence of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: statements to be a valid proof, each statement, apart from the premises at, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the beginning, had to follow from previous ones according to one of a fixed, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: set of patterns called syllogisms. A typical syllogism was, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:   , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  All men are mortal.  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  Socrates is a man.  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: ————————————————————, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: [Therefore] Socrates is mortal., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: In other words, this rule said that if a statement of the form ‘all As have, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: property B’ (as in ‘all men are mortal’) appears in a proof, and another, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: statement of the form ‘the individual X is an A’ (as in ‘Socrates is a man’), Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: also appears, then the statement ‘X has property B’ (‘Socrates is mortal’), Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: may validly appear later in the proof, and in particular it is a valid conclusion., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: The syllogisms expressed what we would call rules of inference — that is,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: rules defining the steps that are permitted in proofs, such that the truth of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: premises is transmitted to the conclusions. By the same token, they are rules, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that can be applied to determine whether a purported proof is valid or not., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Aristotle had declared that all valid proofs could be expressed in syllogistic, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: form. But he had not proved this! And the problem for proof theory was that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: very few modern mathematical proofs were expressed purely as a sequence, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of syllogisms; nor could many of them be recast in that form, even in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: principle. Yet most mathematicians could not bring themselves to stick to the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: letter of the Aristotelian law, since some of the new proofs seemed just as, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: self-evidently valid as Aristotelian reasoning. Mathematics had moved on., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: New tools such as symbolic logic and set theory allowed mathematicians to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: relate mathematical structures to one another in new ways. This had created, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: new self-evident truths that were independent of the classical rules of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: inference, so those classical rules were self-evidently inadequate. But which, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of the new methods of proof were genuinely infallible? How were the rules of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: inference to be modified so that they would have the completeness that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Aristotle had mistakenly claimed? How could the absolute authority of the old, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: rules ever be regained if mathematicians could not agree on what was self-, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: evident and what was nonsense?, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Meanwhile, mathematicians were continuing to construct their abstract, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: castles in the sky. For practical purposes many of these constructs seemed, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: sound enough. Some had become indispensable in science and technology,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and most were connected by a beautiful and fruitful explanatory structure., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Nevertheless, no one could guarantee that the entire structure, or any, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: substantial part of it, was not founded upon a logical contradiction, which, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: would make it literally nonsense. In 1902 Bertrand Russell proved that a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: scheme for defining set theory rigorously, which had just been proposed by, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the German logician Gottlob Frege, was inconsistent. This did not mean that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: it was necessarily invalid to use sets in proofs. Indeed, very few, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mathematicians seriously supposed that any of the usual ways of using sets,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: or arithmetic, or other core areas of mathematics, might be invalid. What was, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: shocking about Russell’s result was that mathematicians had believed their, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: subject to be par excellence the means of delivering absolute certainty, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: through the proofs of mathematical theorems. The very possibility of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: controversy over the validity of different methods of proof undermined the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: whole purpose (as it was supposed) of the subject., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Many mathematicians therefore felt that it was a matter of urgency to place, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: proof theory, and thereby mathematics itself, on a secure foundation. They, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: wanted to consolidate after their headlong advances: to define once and for, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: all which types of proof were absolutely secure, and which were not., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Whatever was outside the secure zone could be dropped, and whatever was, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: inside would be the sole basis of all future mathematics., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: To this end, the Dutch mathematician Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: advocated an extreme conservative strategy for proof theory, known as, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: intuitionism, which still has adherents to this day. Intuitionists try to construe, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘intuition’ in the narrowest conceivable way, retaining only what they consider, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to be its unchallengeably self-evident aspects. Then they elevate, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mathematical intuition, thus defined, to a status higher even than Plato, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: afforded it: they regard it as being prior even to pure logic. Thus they regard, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: logic itself as untrustworthy, except where it is justified by direct, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mathematical intuition. For instance, intuitionists deny that it is possible to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: have a direct intuition of any infinite entity. Therefore they deny that any, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: infinite sets, such as the set of all natural numbers, exist at all. The, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: proposition ‘there exist infinitely many natural numbers’ they would consider, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: self-evidently false. And the proposition ‘there exist more Cantgotu, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: environments than physically possible environments’ they would consider, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: completely meaningless., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Historically, intuitionism played a valuable liberating role, just as inductivism, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: did. It dared to question received certainties — some of which were indeed, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: false. But as a positive theory of what is or is not a valid mathematical proof,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: it is worthless. Indeed, intuitionism is precisely the expression, in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mathematics, of solipsism. In both cases there is an over-reaction to the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: thought that we cannot be sure of what we know about the wider world. In, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: both cases the proposed solution is to retreat into an inner world which we, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: can supposedly know directly and therefore (?) can be sure of knowing truly., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: In both cases the solution involves either denying the existence — or at least, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: renouncing explanation — of what lies outside. And in both cases this, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: renunciation also makes it impossible to explain much of what lies inside the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: favoured domain. For instance, if it is indeed false, as intuitionists maintain,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that there exist infinitely many natural numbers, then we can infer that there, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: must be only finitely many of them. How many? And then, however many, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: there are, why can we not form an intuition of the next natural number above, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that one? Intuitionists would explain this problem away by pointing out that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the argument I have just given assumes the validity of ordinary logic. In, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: particular, it involves inferring, from the fact that there are not infinitely many, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: natural numbers, that there must be some particular finite number of them., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: The relevant rule of inference is called the law of the excluded middle. It, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: says that, for any proposition X (such as ‘there are infinitely many natural, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: numbers’), there is no third possibility between X being true and its negation, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: (‘there are finitely many natural numbers’) being true. Intuitionists coolly deny, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the law of the excluded middle., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Since, in most people’s minds, the law of the excluded middle is itself, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: backed by a powerful intuition, its rejection naturally causes non-intuitionists, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to wonder whether the intuitionists’ intuition is so self-evidently reliable after, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: all. Or, if we consider the law of the excluded middle to stem from a logical, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: intuition, it leads us to re-examine the question whether mathematical, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: intuition really supersedes logic. At any rate, can it be self-evident that it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: does?, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: But all that is only to criticize intuitionism from the outside. It is no disproof;, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: nor can intuitionism ever be disproved. If someone insists that a self-, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: consistent proposition is self-evident to them, just as if they insist that they, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: alone exist, they cannot be proved wrong. However, as with solipsism, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: generally, the truly fatal flaw of intuitionism is revealed not when it is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: attacked, but when it is taken seriously in its own terms, as an explanation of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: its own, arbitrarily truncated world. Intuitionists believe in the reality of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: finite natural numbers 1, 2, 3, …, and even 10,949,769,651,859. But the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: intuitive argument that because each of these numbers has a successor,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: they form an infinite sequence, is in the intuitionists’ view no more than a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: self-delusion or affectation and is literally untenable. But by severing the link, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: between their version of the abstract ‘natural numbers’ and the intuitions that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: those numbers were originally intended to formalize, intuitionists have also, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: denied themselves the usual explanatory structure through which natural, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: numbers are understood. This raises a problem for anyone who prefers, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explanations to unexplained complications. Instead of solving that problem, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: by providing an alternative or deeper explanatory structure for the natural, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: numbers, intuitionism does exactly what the Inquisition did, and what, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: solipsists do: it retreats still further from explanation. It introduces further, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: unexplained complications (in this case the denial of the law of the excluded, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: middle) whose only purpose is to allow intuitionists to behave as if their, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: opponents’ explanation were true, while drawing no conclusions about reality, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: from this., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Just as solipsism starts with the motivation of simplifying a frighteningly, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: diverse and uncertain world, but when taken seriously turns out to be realism, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: plus some unnecessary complications, so intuitionism ends up being one of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the most counter-intuitive doctrines that has ever been seriously advocated., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: David Hilbert proposed a much more commonsensical — but still ultimately, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: doomed — plan to ‘establish once and for all the certitude of mathematical, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: methods’. Hilbert’s plan was based on the idea of consistency. He hoped to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: lay down, once and for all, a complete set of modern rules of inference for, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mathematical proofs, with certain properties. They would be finite in number., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: They would be straightforwardly applicable, so that determining whether any, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: purported proof satisfied them or not would be an uncontroversial exercise., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Preferably, the rules would be intuitively self-evident, but that was not an, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: overriding consideration for the pragmatic Hilbert. He would be satisfied if, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the rules corresponded only moderately well to intuition, provided that he, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: could be sure that they were self-consistent. That is, if the rules designated a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: given proof as valid, he wanted to be sure that they could never designate, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: any proof with the opposite conclusion as valid. How could he be sure of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: such a thing? This time, consistency would have to be proved, using a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: method of proof which itself adhered to the same rules of inference. Then, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Hilbert hoped that Aristotelian completeness and certainty would be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: restored, and that every true mathematical statement would in principle be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: provable under the rules, and that no false statement would be. In 1900, to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mark the turn of the century, Hilbert published a list of problems that he, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: hoped mathematicians might be able to solve during the course of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: twentieth century. The tenth problem was to find a set of rules of inference, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: with the above properties, and, by their own standards, to prove them, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: consistent., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Hilbert was to be definitively disappointed. Thirty-one years later, Kurt Gödel, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: revolutionized proof theory with a root-and-branch refutation from which the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mathematical and philosophical worlds are still reeling: he proved that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Hilbert’s tenth problem is insoluble. Gödel proved first that any set of rules of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: inference that is capable of correctly validating even the proofs of ordinary, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: arithmetic could never validate a proof of its own consistency. Therefore, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: there is no hope of finding the provably consistent set of rules that Hilbert, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: envisaged. Second, Gödel proved that if a set of rules of inference in some, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: (sufficiently rich) branch of mathematics is consistent (whether provably so, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: or not), then within that branch of mathematics there must exist valid, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: methods of proof that those rules fail to designate as valid. This is called, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Gödel’s incompleteness theorem. To prove his theorems, Gödel used a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: remarkable extension of the Cantor ‘diagonal argument’ that I mentioned in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: Chapter 6. He began by considering any consistent set of rules of inference., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Then he showed how to construct a proposition which could neither be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: proved nor disproved under those rules. Then he proved that that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: proposition would be true., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: If Hilbert’s programme had worked, it would have been bad news for the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: conception of reality that I am promoting in this book, for it would have, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: removed the necessity for understanding in judging mathematical ideas., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Anyone — or any mindless machine — that could learn Hilbert’s hoped-for, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: rules of inference by heart would be as good a judge of mathematical, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: propositions as the ablest mathematician, yet without needing the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mathematician’s insight or understanding, or even having the remotest clue, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: as to what the propositions were about. In principle, it would be possible to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: make new mathematical discoveries without knowing any mathematics at all,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: beyond Hilbert’s rules. One would simply check through all possible strings, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of letters and mathematical symbols in alphabetical order, until one of them, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: passed the test for being a proof or disproof of some famous unsolved, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: conjecture. In principle, one could settle any mathematical controversy, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: without ever understanding it — without even knowing the meanings of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: symbols, let alone understanding how the proof worked, or what it proved, or, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: what the method of proof was, or why it was reliable., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: It may seem that the achievement of a unified standard of proof in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mathematics could at least have helped us in the overall drive towards, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: unification — that is, the ‘deepening’ of our knowledge that I referred to in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Chapter 1. But the opposite is the case. Like the predictive ‘theory of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: everything’ in physics, Hilbert’s rules would have told us almost nothing, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: about the fabric of reality. They would, as far as mathematics goes, have, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: realized the ultimate reductionist vision, predicting everything (in principle), Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: but explaining nothing. Moreover, if mathematics had been reductionist then, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: all the undesirable features which I argued in Chapter 1 are absent from the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: structure of human knowledge would have been present in mathematics:, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mathematical ideas would have formed a hierarchy, with Hilbert’s rules at its, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: root. Mathematical truths whose verification from the rules was very complex, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: would have been objectively less fundamental than those that could be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: verified immediately from the rules. Since there could have been only a finite, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: supply of such fundamental truths, as time went on mathematics would have, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: had to concern itself with ever less fundamental problems. Mathematics, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: might well have come to an end, under this dismal hypothesis. If it did not, it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: would inevitably have fragmented into ever more arcane specialities, as the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: complexity of the ‘emergent’ issues that mathematicians would have been, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: forced to study increased, and as the connections between those issues and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the foundations of the subject became ever more remote., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Thanks to Goedel, we know that there will never be a fixed method of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: determining whether a mathematical proposition is true, any more than there, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: is a fixed way of determining whether a scientific theory is true. Nor will there, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ever be a fixed way of generating new mathematical knowledge. Therefore, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: progress in mathematics will always depend on the exercise of creativity. It, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: will always be possible, and necessary, for mathematicians to invent new, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: types of proof. They will validate them by new arguments and by new modes, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of explanation depending on their ever improving understanding of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: abstract entities involved. Gödel’s own theorems were a case in point: to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: prove them, he had to invent a new method of proof. I said the method was, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: based on the ‘diagonal argument’, but Gödel extended that argument in a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: new way. Nothing had ever been proved in this way before; no rules of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: inference laid down by someone who had never seen Gödel’s method could, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: possibly have been prescient enough to designate it as valid. Yet it is self-, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: evidently valid. Where did this self-evidentness come from? It came from, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Gödel’s understanding of the nature of proof. Gödel’s proofs are as, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: compelling as any in mathematics, but only if one first understands the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explanation that accompanies them., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: So explanation does, after all, play the same paramount role in pure, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mathematics as it does in science. Explaining and understanding the world, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: — the physical world and the world of mathematical abstractions — is in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: both cases the object of the exercise. Proof and observation are merely, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: means by which we check our explanations. Roger Penrose has drawn a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: further, radical and very Platonic lesson from Gödel’s results. Like Plato,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Penrose is fascinated by the ability of the human mind to grasp the abstract, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: certainties of mathematics. Unlike Plato, Penrose does not believe in the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: supernatural, and takes it for granted that the brain is part of, and has, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: access only to, the natural world. So the problem is even more acute for him, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: than it was for Plato: how can the fuzzy, unreliable physical world deliver, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mathematical certainties to a fuzzy, unreliable part of itself such as a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mathematician? In particular, Penrose wonders how we can possibly, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: perceive the infallibility of new, valid forms of proof, of which Gödel assures, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: us there is an unlimited supply., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Penrose is still working on a detailed answer, but he does claim that the very, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: existence of this sort of open-ended mathematical intuition is fundamentally, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: incompatible with the existing structure of physics, and in particular that it is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: incompatible with the Turing principle. His argument, in summary, runs as, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: follows. If the Turing principle is true, then we can consider the brain (like, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: any other object) to be a computer executing a particular program. The, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: brain’s interactions with the environment constitute the inputs and outputs of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the program. Now consider a mathematician in the act of deciding whether, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: some newly proposed type of proof is valid or not. Making such a decision is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: tantamount to executing a proof-validating computer program within the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mathematician’s brain. Such a program embodies a set of Hilbertian rules of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: inference which, according to Gödel’s theorem, cannot possibly be complete., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Moreover, as I have said, Gödel provides a way of constructing, and proving,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: a true proposition which those rules can never recognize as proven., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Therefore the mathematician, whose mind is effectively a computer applying, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: those rules, can never recognize the proposition as proven either. Penrose, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: then proposes to show the proposition, and Gödel’s method of proving it to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: be true, to that very mathematician. The mathematician understands the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: proof. It is, after all, self-evidently valid, so the mathematician can, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: presumably see that it is valid. But that would contradict Gödel’s theorem., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Therefore there must be a false assumption somewhere in the argument,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and Penrose thinks that the false assumption is the Turing principle., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Most computer scientists do not agree with Penrose that the Turing principle, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: is the weakest link in his story. They would say that the mathematician in the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: story would indeed be unable to recognize the Gödelian proposition as, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: proven. It may seem odd that a mathematician should suddenly become, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: unable to comprehend a self-evident proof. But look at this proposition:, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:   , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  David Deutsch cannot consistently judge this statement to be true.  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: I am trying as hard as I can, but I cannot consistently judge it to be true. For, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: if I did, I would be judging that I cannot judge it to be true, and would be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: contradicting myself. But you can see that it is true, can’t you? This shows it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: is at least possible for a proposition to be unfathomable to one person yet, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: self-evidently true to everyone else., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Anyway, Penrose hopes for a new, fundamental theory of physics replacing, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: both quantum theory and the general theory of relativity. It would make new,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: testable predictions, though it would of course agree with quantum theory, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and relativity for all existing observations. (There are no known experimental, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: counter-examples to those theories.) However, Penrose’s world is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: fundamentally very different from what existing physics describes. Its basic, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: fabric of reality is what we call the world of mathematical abstractions. In this, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: respect Penrose, whose reality includes all mathematical abstractions, but, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: perhaps not all abstractions (like honour and justice), is somewhere between, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Plato and Pythagoras. What we call the physical world is, to him, fully real, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: (another difference from Plato), but is somehow part of, or emergent from,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mathematics itself. Furthermore, there is no universality; in particular, there, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: is no machine that can render all possible human thought processes., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Nevertheless, the world (especially, of course, its mathematical substrate) is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: still comprehensible. Its comprehensibility is ensured not by the universality, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of computation, but by a phenomenon quite new to physics (though not to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Plato): mathematical entities impinge directly on the human brain, via, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: physical processes yet to be discovered. In this way the brain, according to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Penrose, does not do mathematics solely by reference to what we currently, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: call the physical world. It has direct access to a Platonic reality of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mathematical Forms, and can perceive mathematical truths there with, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: (blunders aside) absolute certainty., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: It is often suggested that the brain may be a quantum computer, and that its, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: intuitions, consciousness and problem-solving abilities might depend on, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: quantum computations. This could be so, but I know of no evidence and no, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: convincing argument that it is so. My bet is that the brain, considered as a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: computer, is a classical one. But that issue is independent of Penrose’s, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ideas. He is not arguing that the brain is a new sort of universal computer,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: differing from the universal quantum computer by having a larger repertoire, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of computations made possible by new, post-quantum physics. He is arguing, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: for a new physics that will not support computational universality, so that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: under his new theory it will not be possible to construe some of the actions, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of the brain as computations at all., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: I must admit that I cannot conceive of such a theory. However, fundamental, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: breakthroughs do tend to be hard to conceive of before they occur., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Naturally, it is hard to judge Penrose’s theory before he succeeds in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: formulating it fully. If a theory with the properties he hopes for does, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: eventually supersede quantum theory or general relativity, or both, whether, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: through experimental testing or by providing a deeper level of explanation,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: then every reasonable person would want to adopt it. And then we would, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: embark on the adventure of comprehending the new world-view that the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theory’s explanatory structures would compel us to adopt. It is likely that this, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: would be a very different world-view from the one I am presenting in this, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: book. However, even if all this came to pass, I am nevertheless at a loss to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: see how the theory’s original motivation, that of explaining our ability to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: grasp new mathematical proofs, could possibly be satisfied. The fact would, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: remain that, now and throughout history, great mathematicians have had, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: different, conflicting intuitions about the validity of various methods of proof., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: So even if it is true that an absolute, physico-mathematical reality feeds its, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: truths directly into our brains to create mathematical intuitions,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mathematicians are not always able to distinguish those intuitions from, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: other, mistaken intuitions and ideas. There is, unfortunately, no bell that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: rings, or light that flashes, when we are comprehending a truly valid proof., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: We might sometimes feel such a flash, at a ‘eureka’ moment — and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: nevertheless be mistaken. And even if the theory predicted that there is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: some previously unnoticed physical indicator accompanying true intuitions, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: (this is getting extremely implausible now), we should certainly find it useful,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: but that would still not amount to a proof that the indicator works. Nothing, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: could prove that an even better physical theory would not one day, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: supersede Penrose’s, and reveal that the supposed indicator was unreliable, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: after all, and some other indicator was better. Thus, even if we make every, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: possible concession to Penrose’s proposal, if we imagine it is true and view, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the world entirely in its terms, it still does not help us to explain the alleged, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: certainty of the knowledge that we acquire by doing mathematics., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: I have presented only a sketch of the arguments of Penrose and his, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: opponents. The reader will have gathered that essentially I side with the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: opponents. However, even if it is conceded that Penrose’s Gödelian, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: argument fails to prove what it sets out to prove, and his proposed new, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: physical theory seems unlikely to explain what it sets out to explain, Penrose, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: is nevertheless right that any world-view based on the existing conception of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: scientific rationality creates a problem for the accepted foundations of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mathematics (or, as Penrose would have it, vice versa). This is the ancient, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: problem that Plato raised, a problem which, as Penrose points out, becomes, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: more acute in the light of both Gödel’s theorem and the Turing principle. It is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: this: in a reality composed of physics and understood by the methods of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: science, where does mathematical certainty come from? While most, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mathematicians and computer scientists take the certainty of mathematical, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: intuition for granted, they do not take seriously the problem of reconciling, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: this with a scientific world-view. Penrose does take it seriously, and he, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: proposes a solution. His proposal envisages a comprehensible world, rejects, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the supernatural, recognizes creativity as being central to mathematics,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ascribes objective reality both to the physical world and to abstract entities,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and involves an integration of the foundations of mathematics and physics., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: In all those respects I am on his side., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Since Brouwer’s, and Hilbert’s, and Penrose’s and all other attempts to meet, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Plato’s challenge do not seem to have succeeded, it is worth looking again, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: at Plato’s apparent demolition of the idea that mathematical truth can be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: obtained by the methods of science., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: First of all, Plato tells us that since we have access only to imperfect circles, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: (say) we cannot thereby obtain any knowledge of perfect circles. But why, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: not, exactly? One might as well say that we cannot discover the laws of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: planetary motion because we do not have access to real planets but only to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: images of planets. (The Inquisition did say this, and I have explained why, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: they were wrong.) One might as well say that it is impossible to build, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: accurate machine tools because the first one would have to be built with, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: inaccurate machine tools. With the benefit of hindsight, we can see that this, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: line of criticism depends on a very crude picture of how science works —, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: something like inductivism — which is hardly surprising, since Plato lived, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: before anything that we would recognize as science. If, say, the only way of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: learning about circles from experience were to examine thousands of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: physical circles and then, from the accumulated data, to try to infer, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: something about their abstract Euclidean counterparts, Plato would have a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: point. But if we form a hypothesis that real circles resemble the abstract, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ones in specified ways, and we happen to be right, then we may well learn, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: something about abstract circles by looking at real ones. In Euclidean, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: geometry one often uses diagrams to specify a geometrical problem or its, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: solution. There is a possibility of error in such a method of description if the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: imperfections of circles in the diagram give a misleading impression — for, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: example if two circles seem to touch each other when they do not. But if one, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: understands the relationship between real circles and perfect circles, one, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: can, with care, eliminate all such errors. If one does not understand that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: relationship, it is practically impossible to understand Euclidean geometry at, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: all., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: The reliability of the knowledge of a perfect circle that one can gain from a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: diagram of a circle depends entirely on the accuracy of the hypothesis that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the two resemble each other in the relevant ways. Such a hypothesis,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: referring to a physical object (the diagram), amounts to a physical theory and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: can never be known with certainty. But that does not, as Plato would have it,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: preclude the possibility of learning about perfect circles from experience; it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: just precludes the possibility of certainty. That should not worry anyone who, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: is looking not for certainty but for explanations., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Euclidean geometry can be abstractly formulated entirely without diagrams., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: But the way in which numerals, letters and mathematical symbols are used, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: in a symbolic proof can generate no more certainty than a diagram can, and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: for the same reason. The symbols too are physical objects — patterns of ink, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: on paper, say — which denote abstract objects. And again, we are relying, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: entirely upon the hypothesis that the physical behaviour of the symbols, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: corresponds to the behaviour of the abstractions they denote. Therefore the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: reliability of what we learn by manipulating those symbols depends entirely, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: on the accuracy of our theories of their physical behaviour, and of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: behaviour of our hands, eyes, and so on with which we manipulate and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: observe the symbols. Trick ink that caused the occasional symbol to change, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: its appearance when we were not looking — perhaps under the remote, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: control of some high-technology practical joker — could soon mislead us, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: about what we know ‘for certain’., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Now let us re-examine another assumption of Plato’s: the assumption that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: we do not have access to perfection in the physical world. He may be right, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that we shall not find perfect honour or justice, and he is certainly right that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: we shall not find the laws of physics or the set of all natural numbers. But we, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: can find a perfect hand in bridge, or the perfect move in a given chess, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: position. That is to say, we can find physical objects or processes that fully, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: possess the properties of the specified abstractions. We can learn chess just, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: as well with a real chess set as we could with a perfect Form of a chess set., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: The fact that a knight is chipped does not make the checkmate it delivers, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: any less final., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: As it happens, a perfect Euclidean circle can be made available to our, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: senses. Plato did not realize this because he did not know about virtual, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: reality. It would not be especially difficult to program the virtual-reality, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: generators I envisaged in Chapter 5 with the rules of Euclidean geometry in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: such a way that the user could experience an interaction with a perfect, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: circle. Having no thickness, the circle would be invisible unless we also, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: modified the laws of optics, in which case we might give it a glow to let the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: user know where it is. (Purists might prefer to manage without this, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: embellishment.) We could make the circle rigid and impenetrable, and the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: user could test its properties using rigid, impenetrable tools and measuring, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: instruments. Virtual-reality callipers would have to come to a perfect knife-, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: edge so that they could measure a zero thickness accurately. The user, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: could be allowed to ‘draw’ further circles or other geometrical figures, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: according to the rules of Euclidean geometry. The sizes of the tools, and the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: user’s own size, could be adjustable at will, to allow the predictions of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: geometrical theorems to be checked on any scale, no matter how fine. In, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: every way, the rendered circle could respond precisely as specified in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Euclid’s axioms. So, on the basis of present-day science we must conclude, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that Plato had it backwards. We can perceive perfect circles in physical, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: reality (i.e. virtual reality); but we shall never perceive them in the domain of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Forms, for, in so far as such a domain can be said to exist, we have no, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: perceptions of it at all., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Incidentally, Plato’s idea that physical reality consists of imperfect imitations, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of abstractions seems an unnecessarily asymmetrical stance nowadays., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Like Plato, we still study abstractions for their own sake. But in post-Galilean, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: science, and in the theory of virtual reality, we also regard abstractions as, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: means of understanding real or artificial physical entities, and in that context, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: we take it for granted that the abstractions are nearly always approximations, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to the true physical situation. So, whereas Plato thought of Earthly circles in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the sand as approximations to true, mathematical circles, a modern physicist, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: would regard a mathematical circle as a bad approximation to the real, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: shapes of planetary orbits, atoms and other physical things., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Given that there will always be a possibility that the virtual-reality generator, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: or its user interface will go wrong, can a virtual-reality rendering of a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Euclidean circle really be said to achieve perfection, up to the standards of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mathematical certainty? It can. No one claims that mathematics itself is free, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: from that sort of uncertainty. Mathematicians can miscalculate, mis-, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: remember axioms, introduce misprints into their accounts of their own work,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and so on. The claim is that, apart from blunders, their conclusions are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: infallible. Similarly, the virtual-reality generator, when it was working properly, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: according to its design specifications, would render a perfect Euclidean circle, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: perfectly., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: A similar objection would be that we can never tell for sure how the virtual-, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: reality generator will behave under the control of a given program, because, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that depends on the functioning of the machine and ultimately on the laws of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: physics. Since we cannot know the laws of physics for sure, we cannot know, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: for sure that the machine is genuinely rendering Euclidean geometry. But, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: again, no one denies that unforeseen physical phenomena — whether they, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: result from unknown laws of physics or merely from brain disease or trick ink, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: — could mislead a mathematician. But if the laws of physics are in relevant, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: respects as we think they are, then the virtual-reality generator can do its job, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: perfectly, even though we cannot be certain that it is doing so. We must be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: careful here to distinguish between two issues: whether we can know that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the virtual-reality machine is rendering a perfect circle; and whether it is in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: fact rendering one. We can never know for sure, but that need not detract, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: one iota from the perfection of the circle that the machine actually renders. I, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: shall return to this crucial distinction — between perfect knowledge, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: (certainty) about an entity, and the entity itself being ‘perfect’ — in a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: moment., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Suppose that we deliberately modify the Euclidean geometry program so, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that the virtual-reality generator will still render circles quite well, but less, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: than perfectly. Would we be unable to infer anything about perfect circles by, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: experiencing this imperfect rendering? That would depend entirely on, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: whether we knew in what respects the program had been altered. If we did, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: know, we could work out with certainty (apart from blunders, etc.) which, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: aspects of the experiences we had within the machine would faithfully, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: represent perfect circles, and which would not. And in that case the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: knowledge we gained there would be just as reliable as any we gained when, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: we were using the correct program., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: When we imagine circles we are doing just this sort of virtual-reality, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: rendering within our own brains. The reason why this is not a useless way of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: thinking about perfect circles is that we are able to form accurate theories, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: about what properties our imagined circles do or do not share with perfect, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ones., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Using a perfect virtual-reality rendering, we might experience six identical, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: circles touching the edge of another identical circle in a plane without, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: overlapping. This experience, under those circumstances, would amount to a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: rigorous proof that such a pattern is possible, because the geometrical, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: properties of the rendered shapes would be absolutely identical with those of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the abstract shapes. But this sort of ‘hands-on’ interaction with perfect, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: shapes is not capable of yielding every sort of knowledge of Euclidean, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: geometry. Most of the interesting theorems refer not to one geometrical, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: pattern but to infinite classes of patterns. For example, the sum of the angles, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of any Euclidean triangle is 180°. We can measure particular triangles with, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: perfect accuracy in virtual reality, but even in virtual reality we cannot, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: measure all triangles, and so we cannot verify the theorem., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: How do we verify it? We prove it. A proof is traditionally defined as a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: sequence of statements satisfying self-evident rules of inference, but what, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: does the ‘proving’ process  amount to physically? To prove a statement, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: about infinitely many triangles at once, we examine certain physical objects, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: — in this case symbols — which have properties in common with whole, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: classes of triangles. For example, when, under appropriate circumstances,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: we observe the symbols ‘ =DEF’ (i.e. ‘triangle ABC is congruent to triangle, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: DEF’), we conclude that a whole class of triangles that we have defined in a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: particular way always have the same shape as corresponding triangles in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: another class which we have defined differently. The ‘appropriate, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: circumstances’ that give this conclusion the status of proof are, in physical, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: terms, that the symbols appear on a page underneath other symbols (some, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of which represent axioms of Euclidean geometry) and that the pattern in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: which the symbols appear conforms to certain rules, namely the rules of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: inference., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: But which rules of inference should we use? This is like asking how we, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: should program the virtual-reality generator to make it render the world of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Euclidean geometry. The answer is that we must use rules of inference, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: which, to the best of our understanding, will cause our symbols to behave, in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the relevant ways, like the abstract entities they denote. How can we be sure, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that they will? We cannot. Suppose that some critics object to our rules of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: inference because they think that our symbols will behave differently from, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the abstract entities. We cannot appeal to the authority of Aristotle or Plato,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: nor can we prove that our rules of inference are infallible (quite apart from, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Gödel’s theorem, this would lead to an infinite regress, for we should first, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: have to prove that the method of proof that we used was itself valid). Nor, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: can we haughtily tell the critics that there must be something wrong with their, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: intuition, because our intuition says that the symbols will mimic the abstract, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: entities perfectly. All we can do is explain. We must explain why we think, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that, under the circumstances, the symbols will behave in the desired way, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: under our proposed rules. And the critics can explain why they favour a rival, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theory. A disagreement over two such theories is, in part, a disagreement, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: about the observable behaviour of physical objects. Such disagreements, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: can be addressed by the normal methods of science. Sometimes they can, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: be readily resolved; sometimes not. Another cause of such a disagreement, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: could be a conceptual clash about the nature of the abstract entities, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: themselves. Then again, it is a matter of rival explanations, this time about, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: abstractions rather than physical objects. Either we could come to a common, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: understanding with our critics, or we could agree that we were discussing, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: two different abstract objects, or we could fail to agree. There are no, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: guarantees. Thus, contrary to the traditional belief, it is not the case that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: disputes within mathematics can always be resolved by purely procedural, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: means., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: A conventional symbolic proof seems at first sight to have quite a different, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: character from the ‘hands-on’ virtual-reality sort of proof. But we see now, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that they are related in the way that computations are to physical, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: experiments. Any physical experiment can be regarded as a computation,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and any computation is a physical experiment. In both sorts of proof,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: physical entities (whether in virtual reality or not) are manipulated according, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to rules. In both cases the physical entities represent the abstract entities of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: interest. And in both cases the reliability of the proof depends on the truth of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the theory that physical and abstract entities do indeed share the appropriate, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: properties., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: We can also see from the above discussion that proof is a physical process., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: In fact, a proof is a type of computation. ‘Proving’ a proposition means, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: performing a computation which, if one has done it correctly, establishes that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the proposition is true. When we use the word ‘proof’ to denote an object,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: such as an ink-on-paper text, we mean that the object can be used as a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: program for recreating a computation of the appropriate kind., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: It follows that neither the theorems of mathematics, nor the process of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mathematical proof, nor the experience of mathematical intuition, confers, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: any certainty. Nothing does. Our mathematical knowledge may, just like our, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: scientific knowledge, be deep and broad, it may be subtle and wonderfully, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explanatory, it may be uncontroversially accepted; but it cannot be certain., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: No one can guarantee that a proof that was previously thought to be valid, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: will not one day turn out to contain a profound misconception, made to seem, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: natural by a previously unquestioned ‘self-evident’ assumption either about, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the physical world, or about the abstract world, or about the way in which, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: some physical and abstract entities are related., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: It was just such a mistaken, self-evident assumption that caused geometry, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: itself to be mis-classified as a branch of mathematics for over two millennia,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: from about 300 BC when Euclid wrote his Elements, to the nineteenth, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: century (and indeed in most dictionaries and schoolbooks to this day)., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Euclidean geometry formed part of every mathematician’s intuition., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Eventually some mathematicians began to doubt that one in particular of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Euclid’s axioms was self-evident (the so-called ‘parallel axiom’). They did, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: not, at first, doubt that this axiom was true. The great German mathematician, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Carl Friedrich Gauss is said to have been the first to put it to the test. The, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: parallel axiom is required in the proof that the angles of a triangle add up to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: 180°. Legend has it that, in the greatest secrecy (for fear of ridicule), Gauss, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: placed assistants with lanterns and theodolites at the summits of three hills,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the vertices of the largest triangle he could conveniently measure. He, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: detected no deviation from Euclid’s predictions, but we now know that that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: was only because his instruments were not sensitive enough. (The vicinity of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the Earth happens to be rather a tame place geometrically.) Einstein’s, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: general theory of relativity included a new theory of geometry that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: contradicted Euclid’s and has been vindicated by experiment. The angles of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: a real triangle really do not necessarily add up to 180°: the true total, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: depends on the gravitational field within the triangle., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: A very similar mis-classification has been caused by the fundamental, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mistake that mathematicians since antiquity have been making about the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: very nature of their subject, namely that mathematical knowledge is more, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: certain than any other form of knowledge. Having made that mistake, one, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: has no choice but to classify proof theory as part of mathematics, for a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mathematical theorem could not be certain if the theory that justifies its, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: method of proof were itself uncertain. But as we have just seen, proof theory, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: is not a branch of mathematics — it is a science. Proofs are not abstract., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: There is no such thing as abstractly proving something, just as there is no, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: such thing as abstractly calculating or computing something. One can of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: course define a class of abstract entities and call them ‘proofs’, but those, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘proofs’ cannot verify mathematical statements because no one can see, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: them. They cannot persuade anyone of the truth of a proposition, any more, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: than an abstract virtual-reality generator that does not physically exist can, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: persuade people that they are in a different environment, or an abstract, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: computer can factorize a number for us. A mathematical ‘theory of proofs’, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: would have no bearing on which mathematical truths can or cannot be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: proved in reality, just as a theory of abstract ‘computation’ has no bearing on, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: what mathematicians — or anyone else — can or cannot calculate in reality,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: unless there is a separate, empirical reason for believing that the abstract, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: ‘computations’ in the theory resemble real computations. Computations,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: including the special computations that qualify as proofs, are physical, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: processes. Proof theory is about how to ensure that those processes, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: correctly mimic the abstract entities they are intended to mimic., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Gödel’s theorems have been hailed as ‘the first new theorems of pure logic, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: for two thousand years’. But that is not so: Gödel’s theorems are about what, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: can and cannot be proved, and proof is a physical process. Nothing in proof, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theory is a matter of logic alone. The new way in which Gödel managed to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: prove general assertions about proofs depends on certain assumptions, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: about which physical processes can or cannot represent an abstract fact in a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: way that an observer can detect and be convinced by. Gödel distilled such, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: assumptions into his explicit and tacit justification of his results. His results, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: were self-evidently justified, not because they were ‘pure logic’ but because, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mathematicians found the assumptions self-evident., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: One of Gödel’s assumptions was the traditional one that a proof can have, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: only a finite number of steps. The intuitive justification of this assumption is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that we are finite beings and could never grasp a literally infinite number of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: assertions. This intuition, by the way, caused many mathematicians to worry, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: when, in 1976, Kenneth Appel and Wolfgang Haken used a computer to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: prove the famous ‘four-colour conjecture’ (that using only four different, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: colours, any map drawn in a plane can be coloured so that no two adjacent, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: regions have the same colour). The program required hundreds of hours of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: computer time, which meant that the steps of the proof, if written down,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: could not have been read, let alone recognized as self-evident, by a human, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: being in many lifetimes. ‘Should we take the computer’s word for it that the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: four-colour conjecture is proved?’, the sceptics wondered — though it had, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: never occurred to them to catalogue all the firings of all the neurons in their, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: own brains when they accepted a relatively ‘simple’ proof., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: The same worry may seem more justified when applied to a putative proof, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: with an infinite number of steps. But what is a ‘step’, and what is ‘infinite’? In, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the fifth century BC Zeno of Elea concluded, on the basis of a similar, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: intuition, that Achilles will never overtake the tortoise if the tortoise has a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: head start. After all, by the time Achilles reaches the point where the tortoise, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: is now, it will have moved on a little. By the time he reaches that point, it will, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: have moved a little further, and so on ad infinitum. Thus the ‘catching-up’, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: procedure requires Achilles to perform an infinite number of catching-up, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: steps, which as a finite being he supposedly cannot do. But what Achilles, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: can do cannot be discovered by pure logic. It depends entirely on what the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: governing laws of physics say he can do. And if those laws say he will, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: overtake the tortoise, then overtake it he will. According to classical physics,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: catching up requires an infinite number of steps of the form ‘move to the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: tortoise’s present location’. In that sense it is a computationally infinite, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: operation. Equivalently, considered as a proof that one abstract quantity, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: becomes larger than another when a given set of operations is applied, it is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: a proof with an infinite number of steps. But the relevant laws designate it as, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: a physically finite process — and that is all that counts., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Gödel’s intuition about steps and finiteness does, as far as we know, capture, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: real physical constraints on the process of proof. Quantum theory requires, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: discrete steps, and none of the known ways in which physical objects can, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: interact would allow for an infinite number of steps to precede a measurable, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: conclusion. (It might, however, be possible for an infinite number of steps to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: be completed in the whole history of the universe — as I shall explain in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Chapter 14.) Classical physics would not have conformed to these intuitions, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: if (impossibly) it had been true. For example, the continuous motion of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: classical systems would have allowed for ‘analogue’ computation which did, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: not proceed in steps and which had a substantially different repertoire from, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the universal Turing machine. Several examples are known of contrived, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: classical laws under which an infinite amount of computation (infinite, that is,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: by Turing-machine or quantum-computer standards) could be performed by, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: physically finite methods. Of course, classical physics is incompatible with, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the results of countless experiments, so it is rather artificial to speculate on, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: what the ‘actual’ classical laws of physics ‘would have been’; but what these, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: examples show is that one cannot prove, independently of any knowledge of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: physics, that a proof must consist of finitely many steps. The same, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: considerations apply to the intuition that there must be finitely many rules of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: inference, and that these must be ‘straightforwardly applicable’. None of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: these requirements is meaningful in the abstract: they are physical, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: requirements. Hilbert, in his influential essay ‘On the Infinite’,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: contemptuously ridiculed the idea that the ‘finite-number-of-steps’, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: requirement is a substantive one. But the above argument shows that he, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: was mistaken: it is substantive, and it follows only from his and other, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mathematicians’ physical intuition., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: At least one of Gödel’s intuitions about proof turns out to have been, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mistaken; fortunately, it happens not to affect the proofs of his theorems. He, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: inherited it intact from the prehistory of Greek mathematics, and it remained, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: unquestioned by every generation of mathematicians until it was proved, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: false in the 1980s by discoveries in the quantum theory of computation. It is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the intuition that a proof is a particular type of object, namely a sequence of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: statements that obey rules of inference. I have already argued that a proof is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: better regarded not as an object but as a process, a type of computation. But, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: in the classical theory of proof or computation this makes no fundamental, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: difference, for the following reason. If we can go through the process of a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: proof, we can, with only a moderate amount of extra effort, keep a record of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: everything relevant that happens during that process. That record, a physical, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: object, will constitute a proof in the sequence-of-statements sense. And, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: conversely, if we have such a record we can read through it, checking that it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: satisfies the rules of inference, and in the process of doing so we shall have, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: proved the conclusion. In other words, in the classical case, converting, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: between proof processes and proof objects is always a tractable task., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Now consider some mathematical calculation that is intractable on all, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: classical computers, but suppose that a quantum computer can easily, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: perform it using interference between, say, 10 500 universes. To make the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: point more clearly, let the calculation be such that the answer (unlike the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: result of a factorization) cannot be tractably verified once we have it. The, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: process of programming a quantum computer to perform such a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: computation, running the program and obtaining a result, constitutes a proof, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that the mathematical calculation has that particular result. But now there is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: no way of keeping a record of everything that happened during the proof, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: process, because most of it happened in other universes, and measuring the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: computational state would alter the interference properties and so invalidate, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: the proof. So creating an old-fashioned proof object would be infeasible;, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: moreover, there is not remotely enough material in the universe as we know, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: it to make such an object, since there would be vastly more steps in the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: proof than there are atoms in the known universe. This example shows that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: because of the possibility of quantum computation, the two notions of proof, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: are not equivalent. The intuition of a proof as an object does not capture all, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the ways in which a mathematical statement may in reality be proved., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Once again, we see the inadequacy of the traditional mathematical method, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of deriving certainty by trying to strip away every possible source of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ambiguity or error from our intuitions until only self-evident truth remains., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: That is what Gödel had done. That is what Church, Post and especially, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Turing had done when trying to intuit their universal models for computation., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Turing hoped that his abstracted-paper-tape model was so simple, so, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: transparent and well defined, that it would not depend on any assumptions, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: about physics that could conceivably be falsified, and therefore that it could, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: become the basis of an abstract theory of computation that was independent, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of the underlying physics. ‘He thought,’ as Feynman once put it, ‘that he, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: understood paper.’ But he was mistaken. Real, quantum-mechanical paper, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: is wildly different from the abstract stuff that the Turing machine uses. The, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Turing machine is entirely classical, and does not allow for the possibility that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the paper might have different symbols written on it in different universes,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and that those might interfere with one another. Of course, it is impractical to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: detect interference between different states of a paper tape. But the point is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that Turing’s intuition, because it included false assumptions from classical, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: physics, caused him to abstract away some of the computational properties, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of his hypothetical machine, the very properties he intended to keep. That is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: why the resulting model of computation was incomplete., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: That mathematicians throughout the ages should have made various, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mistakes about matters of proof and certainty is only natural. The present, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: discussion should lead us to expect that the current view will not last for, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ever, either. But the confidence with which mathematicians have blundered, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: into these mistakes and their inability to acknowledge even the possibility of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: error in these matters are, I think, connected with an ancient and widespread, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: confusion between the methods of mathematics and its subject-matter. Let, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: me explain. Unlike the relationships between physical entities, relationships, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: between abstract entities are independent of any contingent facts and of any, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: laws of physics. They are determined absolutely and objectively by the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: autonomous properties of the abstract entities themselves. Mathematics, the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: study of these relationships and properties, is therefore the study of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: absolutely necessary truths. In other words, the truths that mathematics, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: studies are absolutely certain. But that does not mean that our knowledge of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: those necessary truths is itself certain, nor does it mean that the methods of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mathematics confer necessary truth on their conclusions. After all,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mathematics also studies falsehoods and paradoxes. And that does not, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mean that the conclusions of such a study are necessarily false or, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: paradoxical., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Necessary truth is merely the subject-matter of mathematics, not the reward, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: we get for doing mathematics. The objective of mathematics is not, and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: cannot be, mathematical certainty. It is not even mathematical truth, certain, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: or otherwise. It is, and must be, mathematical explanation., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: Why, then, does mathematics work as well as it does? Why does it lead to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: conclusions which, though not certain, can be accepted and applied, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: unproblematically for millennia at least? Ultimately the reason is that some of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: our knowledge of the physical world is also that reliable and uncontroversial., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: And when we understand the physical world sufficiently well, we also, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: understand which physical objects have properties in common with which, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: abstract ones. But in principle the reliability of our knowledge of mathematics, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: remains subsidiary to our knowledge of physical reality. Every mathematical, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: proof depends absolutely for its validity on our being right about the rules, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that govern the behaviour of some physical objects, be they virtual-reality, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: generators, ink and paper, or our own brains., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: So mathematical intuition is a species of physical intuition. Physical intuition, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: is a set of rules of thumb, some perhaps inborn, many built up in childhood,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: about how the physical world behaves. For example, we have intuitions that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: there are such things as physical objects, and that they have definite, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: attributes such as shape, colour, weight and position in space, some of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: which exist even when the objects are unobserved. Another is that there is a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: physical variable — time — with respect to which attributes change, but that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: nevertheless objects can retain their identity over time. Another is that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: objects interact, and that this can change some of their attributes., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Mathematical intuition concerns the way in which the physical world can, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: consists of a mixture of red and green light (in the sense that yellow light, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: gives us exactly the same sensation as a mixture of red light and green light, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: does). In reality, all three types of light have different frequencies and cannot, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: be created by mixing light of other frequencies. The fact that a mixture of red, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and green light appears to us to be yellow light has nothing whatever to do, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: with the properties of light, but is a property of our eyes. It is the result of a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: design compromise that occurred at some time during our distant ancestors’, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: evolution. It is just possible (though I do not believe it) that Euclidean, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: geometry or Aristotelian logic are somehow built into the structure of our, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: brains, as the philosopher Immanuel Kant believed. But that would not, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: that we have inborn intuitions that we are constitutionally unable to shake, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: by definition intangible, they exist objectively and have properties that are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: independent of the laws of physics. However, it is physics that allows us to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: gain knowledge of this realm. And it imposes stringent constraints. Whereas, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: everything in physical reality is comprehensible, the comprehensible, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mathematical truths are precisely the infinitesimal minority which happen to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: abstractions. It is a very narrow window and gives us only a limited range of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: perspectives. Some of the structures that we see out there, such as the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: SUMMARY, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:   , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Abstract entities that are complex and autonomous exist objectively and are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: part of the fabric of reality. There exist logically necessary truths about these, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: entities, and these comprise the subject-matter of mathematics. However,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: such truths cannot be known with certainty. Proofs do not confer certainty, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: upon their conclusions. The validity of a particular form of proof depends on, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the truth of our theories of the behaviour of the objects with which we, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: perform the proof. Therefore mathematical knowledge is inherently, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: derivative, depending entirely on our knowledge of physics. The, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: comprehensible mathematical truths are precisely the infinitesimal minority, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: which can be rendered in virtual reality. But the incomprehensible, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mathematical entities (e.g. Cantgotu environments) exist too, because they, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Few people think that distance is mysterious, but everyone knows that time, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: is. And all the mysteries of time stem from its basic, common-sense attribute,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: namely that the present moment, which we call ‘now’, is not fixed but moves, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: continuously in the future direction. This motion is called the flow of time., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: We shall see that there is no such thing as the flow of time. Yet the idea of it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: is pure common sense. We take it so much for granted that it is assumed in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the very structure of our language. In A Comprehensive Grammar of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: English Language,  Randolph Quirk and his co-authors explain the common-, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: sense concept of time with the aid of the diagram shown in Figure 11.1., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Each point on the line represents a particular, fixed moment. The triangle ‘ ’, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: indicates where the ‘continuously moving point, the present moment’, is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: located on the line. It is supposed to be moving from left to right. Some, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: people, like Shakespeare in the sonnet quoted above, think of particular, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: events as being ‘fixed’, and the line itself as moving past them (from right to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: left in Figure 11.1), so that moments from the future sweep past the present, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: moment to become past moments., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: What do we mean by ‘time can be thought of as a line?’ We mean that just, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: as a line can be thought of as a sequence of points at different positions, so, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: any moving or changing object can be thought of as a sequence of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: motionless ‘snapshot’ versions of itself, one at each moment. To say that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: each point on the line represents a particular moment is to say that we can, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: imagine all the snapshots stacked together along the line, as in Figure 11.2., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Some of them show the rotating arrow as it was in the past, some show it as, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: it will be in the future, and one of them — the one to which the moving   is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: currently pointing — shows the arrow as it is now, though a moment later, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that particular version of the arrow will be in the past because the  will have, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: moved on. The instantaneous versions of an object collectively are the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: moving object in much the way that a sequence of still pictures projected, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: onto a screen collectively are  a moving picture. None of them, individually,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ever changes. Change consists of their being designated (‘illuminated’) in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: sequence by the moving   (the ‘movie projector’) so that, one by one, they, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: take it in turn to be in the present., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Grammarians nowadays try not to make value-judgements about how, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: language is used; they try only to record, analyse and understand it., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Therefore Quirk et al. are in no way to blame for the quality of the theory of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: time that they describe. They do not claim that it is a good theory. They claim, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: only, and I think quite correctly, that it is our theory. Unfortunately it is not a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: good theory. To put it bluntly, the reason why the common-sense theory of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: time is inherently mysterious is that it is inherently nonsensical. It is not just, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that it is factually inaccurate. We shall see that, even in its own terms, it does, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: not make sense., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: here., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Consider Figure 11.2 again. It illustrates the motion of two entities. One of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: them is a rotating arrow, shown as a sequence of snapshots. The other is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the moving ‘present moment’, sweeping through the picture from left to right., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: But the motion of the present moment is not shown in the picture as a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: sequence of snapshots. Instead, one particular moment is singled out by the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , highlighted in darker lines and uniquely labelled ‘(now)’. Thus, even though, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘now’ is said by the caption to be moving across the picture, only one, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: snapshot of it, at one particular moment, is shown., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:   , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Why? After all, the whole point of this picture is to show what happens over, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: an extended period, not just at one moment. If we had wanted the picture to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: show only one moment, we need not have bothered to show more than one, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: snapshot of the rotating arrow either. The picture is supposed to illustrate the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: common-sense theory that any moving or changing object is a sequence of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: snapshots, one for each moment. So if the   is moving, why do we not show, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: a sequence of snapshots of it too? The single snapshot shown must be only, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: one of many that would exist if this were a true description of how time, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: works. In fact, the picture is positively misleading as it stands: it shows the  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: not moving, but rather coming into existence at a particular moment and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: then immediately ceasing to exist. If that were so, it would make ‘now’ a fixed, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:   moment. It makes no difference that I have added a label ‘Motion of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: present moment’, and a dashed arrow to indicate that the  is moving to the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: right. What the picture itself shows, and what Quirk et al.’s  diagram (Figure, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: 11.1) also shows, is the   never reaching any moment other than the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: highlighted one., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: At best, one could say that Figure 11.2 is a hybrid picture which perversely, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: illustrates motion in two different ways. In regard to the moving arrow it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: illustrates the common-sense theory of time. But it merely states that the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: present moment is moving, while illustrating it as not  moving. How should, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: we alter the picture so that it will illustrate the common-sense theory of time, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: in regard to the motion of the present moment as well as the motion of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: arrow? By including more snapshots of the ‘ ’, one for each moment, each, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: indicating where ‘now’ is at that moment. And where is that? Obviously, at, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: each moment, ‘now’ is that moment. For example, at midnight the ‘ ’ must, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: point to the snapshot of the arrow taken at midnight; at 1.00 a.m. it must, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: point to the 1.00 a.m. snapshot, and so on. Therefore the picture should look, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: like Figure 11.3., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: This amended picture illustrates motion  satisfactorily, but we are now left, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: with a severely pared-down concept of time. The common-sense idea that a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: moving object is a sequence of instantaneous versions of itself remains, but, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the other common-sense idea — of the flow of time — has gone. In this, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: picture there is no ‘continuously moving point, the present moment’,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: sweeping through the fixed moments one by one. There is no process by, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: which any fixed moment starts out in the future, becomes the present and is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: then relegated to the past. The multiple instances of the symbols  and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘(now)’ no longer distinguish one moment from others, and are therefore, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: superfluous. The picture would illustrate the motion of the rotating arrow just, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: as well if they were removed. So there is no single ‘present moment’, except, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: subjectively. From the point of view of an observer at a particular moment,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that moment is indeed singled out, and may uniquely be called ‘now’ by that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: observer, just as any position in space is singled out as ‘here’ from the point, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of view of an observer at that position. But objectively, no moment is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: privileged as being more ‘now’ than the others, just as no position is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: privileged as being more ‘here’ than other positions. The subjective ‘here’, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: may move through space, as the observer moves. Does the subjective ‘now’, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: likewise move through time? Are Figures 11.1 and 11.2 correct after all, in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that they illustrate time from the point of view of an observer at a particular, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: moment? Certainly not. Even subjectively, ‘now’ does not move through, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: time. It is often said that the present seems to be moving forwards in time, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: because the present is defined only relative to our consciousness, and our, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: consciousness is sweeping forwards through the moments. But our, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: consciousness does not, and could not, do that. When we say that our, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: consciousness ‘seems’ to pass from one moment to the next we are merely, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: paraphrasing the common-sense theory of the flow of time. But it makes no, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: If the moving present capriciously stopped moving for a day or two, and then, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: started to move again at ten times its previous speed, what would we be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: conscious of? Nothing special — or rather, that question makes no sense., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: There is nothing there that could move, stop or flow, nor could anything be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: meaningfully called the ‘speed’ of time. Everything that exists in time is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: supposed to take the form of unchanging snapshots arrayed along the time-, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: line. That includes the conscious experiences of all observers, including their, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mistaken intuition that time is ‘flowing’. They may imagine a ‘moving present’, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: travelling along the line, stopping and starting, or even going backwards or, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ceasing to exist altogether. But imagining it does not make it happen., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Nothing can move along the line. Time cannot flow., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: The idea of the flow of time really presupposes the existence of a second, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: sort of time, outside the common-sense sequence-of-moments time. If ‘now’, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: really moved from one of the moments to another, it would have to be with, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: respect to this exterior time. But taking that seriously leads to an infinite, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: regress, for we should then have to imagine the exterior time itself as a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: succession of moments, with its own ‘present moment’ that was moving with, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: respect to a still more exterior time — and so on. At each stage, the flow of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: time would not make sense unless we attributed it to the flow of an exterior, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: time, ad infinitum. At each stage, we would have a concept that made no, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: sense; and the whole infinite hierarchy would make no sense either., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: The origin of this sort of mistake is that we are accustomed to time being a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: framework exterior to any physical entity we may be considering. We are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: used to imagining any physical object as potentially changing, and so, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: existing as a sequence of versions of itself at different moments. But the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: sequence of moments itself, in pictures like Figures 11.1—11.3, is an, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: exceptional entity. It does not exist within the framework of time — it is the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: framework of time. Since there is no time outside it, it is incoherent to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: imagine it changing or existing in more than one consecutive version. This, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: makes such pictures hard to grasp. The picture itself, like any other physical, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: object, does exist over a period of time and does consist of multiple versions, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of itself. But what the picture depicts — namely, the sequence of versions of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: something — exists in only one version. No accurate picture of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: framework of time can be a moving or changing picture. It must be static. But, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: there is an inherent psychological difficulty in taking this on board. Although, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the picture is static, we cannot understand it statically. It shows a sequence, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of moments simultaneously on the page, and in order to relate that to our, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: experience the focus of our attention must move along the sequence. For, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: example, we might look at one snapshot, and take it to represent ‘now’, and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: a moment later look at a snapshot to the right of it and think of that as, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: representing the new ‘now’. Then we tend to confuse the genuine motion of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: our focus of attention across the mere picture, with the impossible motion of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: something through real moments. It is easily done., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: But there is more to this problem than the difficulty of illustrating the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: common-sense theory of time. The theory itself contains a substantive and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: deep equivocation: it cannot make up its mind whether the present is,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: objectively, a single moment or many — and hence, for example, whether, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Figure 11.1 depicts one moment or many. Common sense wants the present, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to be a single moment so as to allow the flow of time — to allow the present, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to sweep through the moments from past to future. But common sense also, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: wants time to be a sequence of moments, with all motion and change, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: consisting of differences between versions of an entity at different moments., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: And that means that the moments are themselves unchanging. So a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: particular moment cannot become the present, or cease to be the present,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: for these would be changes. Therefore the present cannot, objectively, be a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: single moment., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: The reason why we cling to these two incompatible concepts — the moving, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: present and the sequence of unchanging moments — is that we need them, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: both, or rather, that we think we do. We continually invoke both of them in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: everyday life, albeit never quite in the same breath. When we are describing, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: events, saying when things happen, we think in terms of a sequence of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: unchanging moments; when we are explaining events as causes and effects, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of each other, we think in terms of the moving present., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: For example, in saying that Faraday discovered electromagnetic induction ‘in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: 1831’ we are assigning that event to a certain range of moments. That is, we, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: are specifying on which set of snapshots, in the long sheaf of snapshots of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: world history, that discovery is to be found. No flow of time is involved when, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: we say when something happened, any more than a ‘flow of distance’ is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: involved if we say where it happened. But as soon as we say why something, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: happened, we invoke the flow of time. If we say that we owe our electric, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: motors and dynamos in part to Faraday, and that the repercussions of his, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: discovery are being felt to this day, we have in mind a picture of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: repercussions beginning in 1831 and sweeping consecutively through all the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: moments of the rest of the nineteenth century, and then reaching the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: twentieth century and causing things like power stations to come into, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: existence there. If we are not careful, we think of the twentieth century as, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: initially ‘not yet affected’ by the momentous event of 1831, and then being, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘changed’ by the repercussions as they sweep past on their way to the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: twenty-first century and beyond. But usually we are careful, and we avoid, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that incoherent thought by never using the two parts of the common-sense, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theory of time simultaneously. Only when we think about time itself do we do, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that, and then we marvel at the mystery of it all! Perhaps ‘paradox’ is a better, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: word than mystery, for we have here a blatant conflict between two, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: apparently self-evident ideas. They cannot both be true. We shall see that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: neither is true., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Our theories of physics are, unlike common sense, coherent, and they first, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: achieved this by dropping the idea of the flow of time. Admittedly, physicists, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: talk about the flow of time just as everyone else does. For example, in his, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: book Principia, in which he set out the principles of Newtonian mechanics, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and gravitation, Newton wrote:, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:   , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Absolute, true, and mathematical time, of itself, and from its own nature,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: flows equably without relation to anything external., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: But Newton wisely makes no attempt to translate his assertion that time, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: flows into mathematical form, or to derive any conclusion from it. None of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Newton’s physical theories refers to the flow of time, nor has any subsequent, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: physical theory referred to, or been compatible with, the flow of time., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: So why did Newton think it necessary to say that time ‘flows equably’? There, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: is nothing wrong with ‘equably’: one can interpret that as meaning that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: measurements of time are the same for observers at different positions and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: in different states of motion. That is a substantive assertion (which, since, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Einstein, we know to be inaccurate). But it could easily have been stated as I, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: have just stated it, without saying that time flows. I think that Newton was, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: deliberately using the familiar language of time without intending its literal, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: meaning, just as he might have spoken informally of the Sun ‘rising’. He, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: needed to convey to the reader embarking on this revolutionary work that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: there was nothing new or sophisticated in the Newtonian concept of time., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: The Principia assigns to many words, such as ‘force’ and ‘mass’, precise, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: technical meanings which are somewhat different from their common-sense, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ones. But the numbers referred to as ‘times’ are simply the times of common, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: sense, which we find on clocks and calendars, and the concept of time in the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Principia is the common-sense one., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Only, it does not flow. In Newtonian physics, time and motion appear much, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: as in Figure 11.3. One minor difference is that I have been drawing, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: successive moments separated from one another, but in all pre-quantum, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: physics that is an approximation because time is a continuum. We must, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: imagine infinitely many, infinitely thin snapshots interpolating continuously, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: between the ones I have drawn. If each snapshot represents everything, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: throughout the whole of space that physically exists at a particular moment,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: then we can think of the snapshots as being glued together at their faces to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: form a single, unchangeable block containing everything that happens in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: space and time (Figure 11.4) — that is, the whole of physical reality. An, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: inevitable shortcoming of this sort of diagram is that the snapshots of space, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: at each moment are shown as being two-dimensional, whereas in reality, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: they are three-dimensional. Each one of them is space at a particular, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: moment. Thus we are treating time as a fourth dimension, analogous to the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: three dimensions of space in classical geometry. Space and time,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: considered together like this as a four-dimensional entity, are called, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: In Newtonian physics this four-dimensional geometrical interpretation of time, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: was optional, but under Einstein’s theory of relativity it became an, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: indispensable part of the theory. That is because, according to relativity,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: observers moving at different velocities do not agree about which events are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: simultaneous. That is, they do not agree about which events should appear, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: on the same snapshot. So they each perceive spacetime as being sliced up, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: in a different way into ‘moments’. Nevertheless, if they each stacked their, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: snapshots in the manner of Figure 11.4, the spacetimes they constructed, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: would be identical. Therefore, according to relativity, the ‘moments’ shown in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Figure 11.4 are not objective features of spacetime: they are only one, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: observer’s way of perceiving simultaneity. Another observer would draw the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘now’ slices at a different angle. So the objective reality behind Figure 11.4,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: namely the spacetime and its physical contents, could be shown as in Figure, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: Spacetime is sometimes referred to as the ‘block universe’, because within it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the whole of physical reality — past, present and future — is laid out once, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and for all, frozen in a single four-dimensional block. Relative to spacetime,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: nothing ever moves. What we call ‘moments’ are certain slices through, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: spacetime, and when the contents of such slices are different from one, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text:   , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: As I have said, we think of the flow of time in connection with causes and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: effects. We think of causes as preceding their effects; we imagine the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: moving present arriving at causes before it arrives at their effects, and we, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: imagine the effects flowing forwards with the present moment., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Philosophically, the most important cause-and-effect processes are our, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: conscious decisions and the consequent actions. The common-sense view, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: is that we have free will: that we are sometimes in a position to affect future, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: events (such as the motion of our own bodies) in any one of several possible, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ways, and to choose which shall occur; whereas, in contrast, we are never in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: a position to affect the past at all. (I shall discuss free will in Chapter 13.) The, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: past is fixed; the future is open. To many philosophers, the flow of time is the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: process in which the open future becomes, moment by moment, the fixed, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: past. Others say that the alternative events at each moment in the future are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: possibilities, and the flow of time is the process by which, moment by, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: moment, one of these possibilities becomes actual (so that, according to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: those people, the future does not exist at all until the flow of time hits it and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: turns it into the past). But if the future really is open (and it is!), then that can, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: have nothing to do with the flow of time, for there is no flow of time. In, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: spacetime physics (which is, effectively, all pre-quantum physics, starting, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: with Newton) the future is not open. It is there, with definite, fixed contents,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: just like the past and present. If a particular moment in spacetime were, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘open’ (in any sense) it would necessarily remain open when it became the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: present and the past, for moments cannot change., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  Subjectively, the future of a given observer may be said to be ‘open from, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that observer’s point of view’ because one cannot measure or observe one’s, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: own future. But openness in that subjective sense does not allow choices. If, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: you have a ticket for last week’s lottery, but have not yet found out whether, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: you have won, the outcome is still open from your point of view, even though, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: objectively it is fixed. But, subjectively or objectively, you cannot change it., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: No causes which have not already affected it can do so any longer. The, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: common-sense theory of free will says that last week, while you still had a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: choice whether to buy a ticket or not, the future was still objectively open,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and you really could have chosen any of two or more options. But that is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: incompatible with spacetime. So according to spacetime physics, the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: openness of the future is an illusion, and therefore causation and free will, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: can be no more than illusions as well. We need, and cling to, the belief that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the future can be affected by present events, and especially by our choices;, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: but perhaps that is just our way of coping with the fact that we do not know, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the future. In reality, we make no choices. Even as we think we are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: considering a choice, its outcome is already there, on the appropriate slice of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: spacetime, unchangeable like everything else in spacetime, and impervious, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to our deliberations. It seems that those deliberations themselves are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: unchangeable and already in existence at their allotted moments before we, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ever know of them., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: To be an ‘effect’ of some cause means to be affected by that cause — to be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: changed by it. Thus when spacetime physics denies the reality of the flow of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: time, it logically cannot accommodate the common-sense notions of cause, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and effect either. For in the block universe nothing is changeable: one part of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: spacetime can no more change another than one part of a fixed three-, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: dimensional object can change another., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: It so happens that all fundamental theories in the era of spacetime physics, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: had the property that given everything that happens before a given moment,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the laws of physics determine what happens at all subsequent moments., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: The property of snapshots being determined by other snapshots is called, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: determinism. In Newtonian physics, for instance, if at any moment one, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: knows the positions and velocities of all the masses in an isolated system,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: such as the solar system, one can in principle calculate (predict) where, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: those masses will be at all times thereafter. One can also in principle, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: calculate (retrodict) where those masses were at all previous times., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: The laws of physics that determine one snapshot from another are the ‘glue’, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that holds the snapshots together as a spacetime. Let us imagine ourselves,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: magically and impossibly, outside spacetime (and therefore in an external, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: time of our own, independent of that within spacetime). Let us slice, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: spacetime into snapshots of space at each moment as perceived by a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: particular observer within spacetime, then shuffle the snapshots and glue, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: them together again in a new order. Could we tell, from the outside, that this, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: is not the real spacetime? Almost certainly. For one thing, in the shuffled, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: spacetime physical processes would not be continuous. Objects would, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: instantaneously cease to exist at one point and reappear at another., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Second, and more important, the laws of physics would no longer hold. At, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: least, the real laws of physics would no longer hold. There would exist a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: different set of laws that took the shuffling into account, explicitly or implicitly,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and correctly described the shuffled spacetime., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: So to us, the difference between the shuffled spacetime and the real one, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: would be gross. But what about the inhabitants? Could they tell the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: difference? We are getting dangerously close to nonsense here — the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: familiar nonsense of the common-sense theory of time. But bear with me, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and we shall skirt around the nonsense. Of course the inhabitants could not, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: tell the difference. If they could, they would. They would, for instance,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: comment on the existence of discontinuities in their world, and publish, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: scientific papers about them — that is, if they could survive in the shuffled, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: spacetime at all. But from our magical vantage-point we can see that they do, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: survive, and so do their scientific papers. We can read those papers, and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: see that they still contain only observations of the original spacetime. All, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: records within the spacetime of physical events, including those in the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: memories and perceptions of conscious observers, are identical to those in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the original spacetime. We have only shuffled the snapshots, not changed, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: them internally, so the inhabitants still perceive them in the original order., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Thus in terms of real physics — physics as perceived by the spacetime’s, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: inhabitants — all this slicing up and re-gluing of spacetime is meaningless., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Not only the shuffled spacetime, but even the collection of unglued-together, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: snapshots, is physically identical to the original spacetime. We picture all the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: snapshots glued together in the right order because this represents the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: relationships between them that are determined by the laws of physics. A, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: picture of them glued together in a different order would represent the same, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: physical events — the same history — but would somewhat misrepresent, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the relationships between those events. So the snapshots have an intrinsic, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: order, defined by their contents and by the real laws of physics. Any one of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the snapshots, together with the laws of physics, not only determines what, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: all the others are, it determines their order, and it determines its own place in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the sequence. In other words, each snapshot has a ‘time stamp’ encoded in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: its physical contents., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: That is how it must be if the concept of time is to be freed of the error of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: invoking an overarching framework of time that is external to physical reality., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: The time stamp of a snapshot is the reading on some natural clock that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: exists within that universe. In some snapshots — the ones containing human, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: civilization, for example — there are actual clocks. In others there are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: physical variables — such as the chemical composition of the Sun, or of all, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the matter in space — which can be considered as clocks because they take, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: definite, distinct values on different snapshots, at least over a certain region, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of spacetime. We can standardize and calibrate them to agree with one, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: another where they overlap., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: We can reconstitute the spacetime by using the intrinsic order determined by, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the laws of physics. We start with any of the snapshots. Then we calculate, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: what the immediately preceding and following snapshots should look like,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and we locate those snapshots from the remaining collection and glue them, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: on either side of the original snapshot. Repeating the process builds up the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: whole spacetime. These calculations are too complex to perform in real life,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: but they are legitimate in a thought experiment in which we imagine, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ourselves to be detached from the real, physical world. (Also, strictly, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: speaking, in pre-quantum physics there would be a continuous infinity of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: snapshots, so the process just described would have to be replaced by a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: limiting process in which the spacetime is assembled in an infinite number of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: steps; but the principle is the same.), Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: The predictability of one event from another does not imply that those events, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: are cause and effect. For example, the theory of electrodynamics says that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: all electrons carry the same charge. Therefore, using that theory we can —, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and frequently do — predict the outcome of a measurement on one electron, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: from the outcome of a measurement on another. But neither outcome was, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: caused by the other. In fact, as far as we know, the value of the charge on, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: an electron was not caused by any physical process. Perhaps it is ‘caused’, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: by the laws of physics themselves (though the laws of physics as we, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: currently know them do not predict the charge on the electron; they merely, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: say that all electrons have the same charge). But in any case, here is an, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: example of events (outcomes of measurements on electrons) that are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: predictable from one another, but make no causal contribution to one, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: another., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: Here is another example. If we observe where one piece of a fully, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: assembled jigsaw puzzle is, and we know the shapes of all the pieces, and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that they are interlocked in the proper way, we can predict where all the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: other pieces are. But that does not mean that the other pieces were caused, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to be where they are by the piece we observed being where it is. Whether, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: such causation is involved depends on how the jigsaw puzzle as a whole got, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: there. If the piece we observed was laid down first, then it was indeed, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: among the causes of the other pieces being where they are. If any other, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: piece was laid down first, then the position of the piece we observed was an, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: effect of that, not a cause. But if the puzzle was created by a single stroke of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: a jigsaw-puzzle-shaped cutter, and has never been disassembled, then, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: none of the positions of the pieces are causes or effects of each other. They, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: were not assembled in any order, but were created simultaneously, in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: positions such that the rules of the puzzle were already obeyed, which made, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: those positions mutually predictable. Nevertheless, none of them caused the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: others., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: The determinism of physical laws about events in spacetime is like the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: predictability of a correctly interlocking jigsaw puzzle. The laws of physics, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: determine what happens at one moment from what happens at another, just, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: as the rules of the jigsaw puzzle determine the positions of some pieces, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: from those of others. But, just as with the jigsaw puzzle, whether the events, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: at different moments cause one another or not depends on how the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: moments got there. We cannot tell by looking at a jigsaw puzzle whether it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: got there by being laid down one piece at a time. But with spacetime we, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: know that it does not make sense for one moment to be ‘laid down’ after, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: another, for that would be the flow of time. Therefore we know that even, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: though some events can be predicted from others no event in spacetime, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: caused another. Let me stress again that this is all according to pre-quantum, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: physics, in which everything that happens, happens in spacetime. What we, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: are seeing is that spacetime is incompatible with the existence of cause and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: effect. It is not that people are mistaken when they say that certain physical, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: events are causes and effects of one another, it is just that that intuition is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: incompatible with the laws of spacetime physics. But that is all right, because, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: spacetime physics is false., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: I said in Chapter 8 that two conditions must hold for an entity to be a cause, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of its own replication: first, that the entity is in fact replicated; and second,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that most variants of it, in the same situation, would not be replicated. This, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: definition embodies the idea that a cause is something that makes a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: difference to its effects, and it also works for causation in general. For X to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: be a cause of Y, two conditions must hold: first, that X and Y both happen;, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and second, that Y would not have happened if X had been otherwise. For, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: example, sunlight was a cause of life on Earth because both sunlight and life, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: actually occurred on Earth, and because life would not have evolved in the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: absence of sunlight., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Thus, reasoning about causes and effects is inevitably also about variants of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the causes and effects. One is always saying what would have happened if,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: other things being equal, such and such an event had been different. A, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: historian might make the judgement that ‘if Faraday had died in 1830, then, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: technology would have been delayed for twenty years’. The meaning of this, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: judgement seems perfectly clear and, since in fact Faraday did not die in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: 1830 but discovered electromagnetic induction in 1831, it seems quite, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: plausible too. It is equivalent to saying that the technological progress which, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: did happen was in part caused by Faraday’s discovery, and therefore also, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: by his survival. But what does it mean, in the context of spacetime physics,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to reason about the future of non-existent events? If there is no such event, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: in spacetime as Faraday’s death in 1830, then there is also no such thing as, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: its aftermath. Certainly we can imagine a spacetime that contains such an, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: event; but then, since we are only imagining it, we can also imagine that it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: contains any aftermath we like. We can imagine, for example, that Faraday’s, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: death was followed by an acceleration of technological progress. We might, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: try to get around this ambiguity by imagining only spacetimes in which,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: though the event in question is different from that in actual spacetime, the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: laws of physics are the same. It is not clear what justifies restricting our, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: imagination in this way, but in any case, if the laws of physics are the same, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: then the event in question could not have been different, because the laws, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: determine it unambiguously from the previous history. So the previous, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: history would have to be imagined as being different as well. How different?, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: The effect of our imagined variation in history depends critically on what we, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: take ‘other things being equal’ to mean. And that is irreducibly ambiguous,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: for there are infinitely many ways of imagining a state of affairs prior to 1830, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: which would have led to Faraday’s death in that year. Some of those would, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: undoubtedly have led to faster technological progress, and some to slower., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Which of them are we referring to in the ‘if…then …’ statement? Which, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: counts as ‘other things being equal’? Try as we may, we shall not succeed in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: resolving this ambiguity within spacetime physics. There is no avoiding the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: fact that in spacetime exactly one thing happens in reality, and everything, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: else is fantasy., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: We are forced to conclude that, in spacetime physics, conditional statements, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: whose premise is false (‘if Faraday had died in 1830 …’) have no meaning., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Logicians call such statements counter-factual conditionals, and their status, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: is a traditional paradox. We all know what such statements mean, yet as, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: soon as we try to state their meaning clearly it seems to evaporate. The, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: source of this paradox is not in logic or linguistics, it is in physics — in the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: false physics of spacetime. Physical reality is not a spacetime. It is a much, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: bigger and more diverse entity, the multiverse. To a first approximation the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: multiverse is like a very large number of co-existing and slightly interacting, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: spacetimes. If spacetime is like a stack of snapshots, each snapshot being, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the whole of space at one moment, then the multiverse is like a vast, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: collection of such stacks. Even this (as we shall see) slightly inaccurate, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: picture of the multiverse can already accommodate causes and effects. For, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: in the multiverse there are almost certainly some universes in which Faraday, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: died in 1830, and it is a matter of fact (not observable fact, but objective fact, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: none the less) whether technological progress in those universes was or was, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: not delayed relative to our own. There is nothing arbitrary about which, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: variants of our universe the counter-factual ‘if Faraday had died in 1830…’, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: refers to: it refers to the variants which really occur somewhere in the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: multiverse. That is what resolves the ambiguity. Appealing to imaginary, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: universes does not work, because we can imagine any universes we like, in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: any proportions we like. But in the multiverse, universes are present in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: definite proportions, so it is meaningful to say that certain types of event are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘very rare’ or ‘very common’ in the multiverse, and that some events follow, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: others ‘in most cases’. Most logically possible universes are not present at, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: all — for example, there are no universes in which the charge on an electron, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: is different from that in our universe, or in which the laws of quantum physics, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: do not hold. The laws of physics that are implicitly referred to in the counter-, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: factual are the laws that are actually obeyed in other universes, namely the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: laws of quantum theory. Therefore the ‘if… then’ statement can, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: unambiguously be taken to mean ‘in most universes in which Faraday died, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: in 1830, technological progress was delayed relative to our own’. In general, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: we may say that an event X causes an event Y in our universe if both X and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Y occur in our universe, but in most variants of our universe in which X does, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: not happen, Y does not happen either., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: If the multiverse were literally a collection of spacetimes, the quantum, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: concept of time would be the same as the classical one. As Figure 11.6, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: shows, time would still be a sequence of moments. The only difference, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: would be that at a particular moment in the multiverse, many universes, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: would exist instead of one. Physical reality at a particular moment would be,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: in effect, a ‘super-snapshot’ consisting of snapshots of many different, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: versions of the whole of space. The whole of reality for the whole of time, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: would be the stack of all the super-snapshots, just as classically it was a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: stack of snapshots of space. Because of quantum interference, each, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: snapshot would no longer be determined entirely by previous snapshots of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the same spacetime (though it would approximately, because classical, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: physics is often a good approximation to quantum physics). But the super-, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: snapshots beginning with a particular moment would be entirely and exactly, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: determined by the previous super-snapshots. This complete determinism, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: would not give rise to complete predictability, even in principle, because, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: making a prediction would require a knowledge of what had happened in all, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the universes, and each copy of us can directly perceive only one universe., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Nevertheless, as far as the concept of time is concerned, the picture would, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: be just like a spacetime with a sequence of moments related by deterministic, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: laws, only with more happening at each moment, but most of it hidden from, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: of time — which would also be the quantum theory of gravity — has been a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: tantalizing and unattained goal of theoretical physics for some decades now., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: But we know enough about it to know that, though the laws of quantum, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: physics are perfectly deterministic at the multiverse level, they do not, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: partition the multiverse in the manner of Figure 11.6, into separate, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: spacetimes, or into super-snapshots each of which entirely determines the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: others. So we know that the classical concept of time as a sequence of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: moments cannot be true, though it does provide a good approximation in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: many circumstances — that is, in many regions of the multiverse., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: To elucidate the quantum concept of time, let us imagine that we have sliced, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the multiverse into a heap of individual snapshots, just as we did with, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: spacetime. What can we glue them back together with? As before, the laws, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of physics and the intrinsic, physical properties of the snapshots are the only, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: acceptable glue. If time in the multiverse were a sequence of moments, it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: would have to be possible to identify all the snapshots of space at a given, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: moment, so as to make them into a super-snapshot. Not surprisingly, it turns, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: out that there is no way of doing that. In the multiverse, snapshots do not, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: have ‘time stamps’. There is no such thing as which snapshot from another, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: universe happens ‘at the same moment’ as a particular snapshot in our, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: universe, for that would again imply that there is an overarching framework, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: knowledge it was not stated in a general way until 1983, by Don Page and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: William Wooters. The snapshots which we call ‘other times in our universe’, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: are distinguished from ‘other universes’ only from our perspective, and only, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: in that they are especially closely related to ours by the laws of physics., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: They are therefore the ones of whose existence our own snapshot holds the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: most evidence. For that reason, we discovered them thousands of years, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: before we discovered the rest of the multiverse, which impinges on us very, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: weakly by comparison, through interference effects. We evolved special, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: language constructs (past and future forms of verbs) for talking about them., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: heap for other snapshots that are very similar to the original one, we find that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: this heap is very different from the disassembled spacetime. For one thing,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: we find many snapshots that are absolutely identical to the original. In fact,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: any snapshot that is present at all is present in an infinity of copies. So it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: makes no sense to ask how many snapshots, numerically, have such-and-, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: such a property, but only what proportion of the infinite total have that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: property. For the sake of brevity, when I speak of a certain ‘number’ of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: If, aside from variants of me in other universes, there are also multiple, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: answering that question must give each of them the same answer. To, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: assume that it is physically meaningful to ask which of the identical copies is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: multiverse, relative to which the answer could be given — ‘I am the third one, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: from the left…’. But what ‘left’ could that be, and what does ‘the third one’, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mean? Such terminology makes sense only if we imagine the snapshots of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: we can spare only one point of the diagram for each snapshot. The, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: snapshots we are looking at all contain clocks of some standard type, and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the diagram is arranged so that all the snapshots with a particular clock, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: reading appear in a vertical column, and the clock readings increase from, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: left to right. As we scan along any vertical line in the diagram, not all the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: snapshots we pass through are different. We pass through groups of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: identical ones, as indicated by the shading. The snapshots in which clocks, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: show the earliest reading are at the left edge of the diagram. We see that in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: all those snapshots, which are identical, the coin is spinning. At the right, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: edge of the diagram, we see that in half the snapshots in which clocks show, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the latest reading the coin has fallen with ‘heads’ upwards, and in the other, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: half it has fallen with ‘tails’ upwards. In universes with intermediate clock, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: readings, three types of universe are present, in proportions that vary with, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the clock reading., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: If you were present in the illustrated region of the multiverse, all copies of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: you would have seen the coin spinning at first. Later, half the copies of you, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: would see ‘heads’ come up, and the other half would see ‘tails’. At some, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: intermediate stage you would have seen the coin in a state in which it is still, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: in motion, but from which it is predictable which face it will show when it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: eventually settles down. This differentiation of identical copies of an observer, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: into slightly different versions is responsible for the subjectively probabilistic, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: character of quantum predictions. For if you asked, initially, what result you, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: were destined to see for the coin toss, the answer would be that that is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: strictly unpredictable, for half the copies of you that are asking that question, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: would see ‘heads’ and the other half would see ‘tails’. There is no such thing, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: as ‘which half would see ‘heads’, any more than there is an answer to the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: question ‘which one am I?’. For practical purposes you could regard this as a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: probabilistic prediction that the coin has a 50 per cent chance of coming up, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘heads’, and a 50 per cent chance of coming up ‘tails’., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: collection of ‘heads’ and ‘tails’ snapshots at the later time in Figure 11.7, the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘spinning’ state at an earlier time is completely determined, and vice versa., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Nevertheless, from the point of view of any observer, information is lost in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the coin-tossing process. For whereas the initial, ‘spinning’ state of the coin, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: may be experienced by an observer, the final combined ‘heads’ and ‘tails’, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: state does not correspond to any possible experience of the observer., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Therefore an observer at the earlier time may observe the coin and predict, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: its future state, and the consequent subjective probabilities. But none of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: later copies of the observer can possibly observe the information necessary, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to retrodict the ‘spinning’ state, for that information is by then distributed, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: across two different types of universe, and that makes retrodiction from the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: final state of the coin impossible. For example, if all we know is that the coin, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: is showing ‘heads’, the state a few seconds earlier might have been the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: state I called ‘spinning’, or the coin might have been spinning in the opposite, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: direction, or it might have been showing ‘heads’ all the time. There is no, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: possibility of retrodiction here, even probabilistic retrodiction. The earlier, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: state of the coin is simply not determined by the later state of the ‘heads’, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: snapshots, but only by the joint state of the ‘heads’ and the ‘tails’ snapshots., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Any horizontal line across Figure 11.7 passes through a sequence of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: snapshots with increasing clock readings. We might be tempted to think of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: such a line — such as the one shown in Figure 11.8 — as a spacetime, and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of the whole diagram as a stack of spacetimes, one for each such line. We, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: can read off from Figure 11.8 what happens in the ‘spacetime’ defined by the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: horizontal line. For a period, it contains a spinning coin. Then, for a further, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: period, it contains the coin moving in a way that will predictably result in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘heads’. But later, in contradiction to that, it contains the coin moving in a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: way that will predictably result in ‘tails’, and eventually it does show ‘tails’., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: But this is merely a deficiency of the diagram, as I pointed out in Chapter 9, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: (see Figure 9.4, p. 212). In this case the laws of quantum mechanics predict, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that no observer who remembers seeing the coin in the ‘predictably heads’, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: state can see it in the ‘tails’ state: that is the justification for calling that state, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘predictably heads’ in the first place. Therefore no observer in the multiverse, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: would recognize events as they occur in the ‘spacetime’ defined by the line., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: All this goes to confirm that we cannot glue the snapshots together in an, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: arbitrary fashion, but only in a way that reflects the relationships between, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: them that are determined by the laws of physics. The snapshots along the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: line in Figure 11.8 are not sufficiently interrelated to justify their being, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: grouped together in a single universe. Admittedly they appear in order of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: increasing clock readings which, in spacetime, would be ‘time stamps’ which, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: would be sufficient for the spacetime to be reassembled. But in the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: multiverse there are far too many snapshots for clock readings alone to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text:   , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: In spacetime physics, any snapshot is determined by any other. As I have, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: said, in the multiverse that is in general not so. Typically, the state of one, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: group of identical snapshots (such as the ones in which the coin is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘spinning’) determines the state of an equal number of differing snapshots, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: (such as the ‘heads’ and ‘tails’ ones). Because of the time-reversibility, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: property of the laws of quantum physics, the overall, multi-valued state of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: latter group also determines the state of the former. However, in some, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: regions of the multiverse, and in some places in space, the snapshots of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: some physical objects do fall, for a period, into chains, each of whose, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: members determines all the others to a good approximation. Successive, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: snapshots of the solar system would be the standard example. In such, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: regions, classical physical laws are a good approximation to the quantum, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: Figure 11.6, a collection of spacetimes, and at that level of approximation, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the quantum concept of time reduces to the classical one. One can, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: distinguish approximately between ‘different times’ and ‘different universes’,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and time is approximately a sequence of moments. But that approximation, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: always breaks down if one examines the snapshots in more detail, or looks, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: far forwards or backwards in time, or far afield in the multiverse., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: All experimental results currently available to us are compatible with the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: approximation that time is a sequence of moments. We do not expect that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: approximation to break down in any foreseeable terrestrial experiment, but, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theory tells us that it must break down badly in certain types of physical, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: process. The first is the beginning of the universe, the Big Bang. According, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to classical physics, time began at a moment when space was infinitely, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: dense and occupied only a single point, and before that there were no, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: moments. According to quantum physics (as best we can tell), the snapshots, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: very near the Big Bang are not in any particular order. The sequential, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: property of time does not begin at the Big Bang, but at some later time. In, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the nature of things, it does not make sense to ask how much later. But we, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: can say that the earliest moments which are, to a good approximation,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: sequential occur roughly when classical physics would extrapolate that the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Big Bang had happened 10 –43 seconds (the Planck time) earlier., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: A second and similar sort of breakdown of the sequence of time is thought to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: occur in the interiors of black holes, and at the final recollapse of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: universe (the ‘Big Crunch’), if there is one. In both cases matter is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: compressed to infinite density according to classical physics, just as at the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Big Bang, and the resulting gravitational forces tear the fabric of spacetime, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: apart., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: By the way, if you have ever wondered what happened before the Big Bang,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: or what will happen after the Big Crunch, you can stop wondering now. Why, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: is it hard to accept that there are no moments before the Big Bang or after, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the Big Crunch, so that nothing happens, or exists, there? Because it is hard, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to imagine time coming to a halt, or starting up. But then, time does not have, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to come to a halt or start up, for it does not move at all. The multiverse does, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: not ‘come into existence’ or ‘cease to exist’; those terms presuppose the flow, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of time. It is only imagining the flow of time that makes us wonder what, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: happened ‘before’ or ‘after’ the whole of reality., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Thirdly, it is thought that on a sub-microscopic scale quantum effects again, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: warp and tear the fabric of spacetime, and that closed loops of time — in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: effect, tiny time machines — exist on that scale. As we shall see in the next, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: chapter, this sort of breakdown of the sequence of time is also physically, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: possible on a large scale, and it is an open question whether it occurs near, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: such objects as rotating black holes., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Thus, although we cannot yet detect any of these effects, our best theories, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: already tell us that spacetime physics is never an exact description of reality., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: However good an approximation it is, time in reality must be fundamentally, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: different from the linear sequence which common sense supposes., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Nevertheless, everything in the multiverse is determined just as rigidly as in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: classical spacetime. Remove one snapshot, and the remaining ones, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: determine it exactly. Remove most snapshots, and the few remaining ones, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: may still determine everything that was removed, just as they do in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: spacetime. The difference is only that, unlike spacetime, the multiverse does, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: not consist of the mutually determining layers I have called super-snapshots,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: which could serve as ‘moments’ of the multiverse. It is a complex, multi-, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: dimensional jigsaw puzzle., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: In this jigsaw-puzzle multiverse, which neither consists of a sequence of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: moments nor permits a flow of time, the common-sense concept of cause, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and effect makes perfect sense. The problem that we found with causation, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: in spacetime was that it is a property of variants of the causes and effects,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: as well as of the causes and effects themselves. Since those variants, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: existed only in our imagination, and not in spacetime, we ran up against the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: physical meaning-lessness of drawing substantive conclusions from the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: imagined properties of non-existent (‘counter-factual’) physical processes., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: But in the multiverse variants do exist, in different proportions, and they obey, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: definite, deterministic laws. Given these laws, it is an objective fact which, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: events make a difference to the occurrence of which other events. Suppose, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that there is a group of snapshots, not necessarily identical, but all sharing, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the property X. Suppose that, given the existence of this group, the laws of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: physics determine that there exists another group of snapshots with property, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Y. One of the conditions for X to be a cause of Y has then been met. The, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: other condition has to do with variants. Consider the variants of the first, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: group that do not have the property X. If, from the existence of these, the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: existence of some of the Y snapshots is still determined, then X was not a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: cause of Y: for Y would have happened even without X. But if, from the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: group of non-X variants, only the existence of non-Y variants is determined,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: then X was a cause of Y., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: There is nothing in this definition of cause and effect that logically requires, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: causes to precede their effects, and it could be that in very exotic situations,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: such as very close to the Big Bang or inside black holes, they do not. In, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: everyday experience, however, causes always precede their effects, and this, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: is because — at least in our vicinity in the multiverse — the number of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: distinct types of snapshot tends to increase rapidly with time, and hardly ever, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: decreases. This property is related to the second law of thermodynamics,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: which states that ordered energy, such as chemical or gravitational potential, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: energy, may be converted entirely into disordered energy, i.e. heat, but, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: never vice versa. Heat is microscopically random motion. In multiverse, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: terms, this means many microscopically different states of motion in different, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: universes. For example, in successive snapshots of the coin at ordinary, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: magnifications, it seems that the setting-down process converts a group of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: identical ‘predictably heads’ snapshots into a group of identical ‘heads’, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: snapshots. But during that process the energy of the coin’s motion is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: converted into heat, so at magnifications large enough to see individual, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: molecules the latter group of snapshots are not identical at all. They all, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: agree that the coin is in the ‘heads’ position, but they show its molecules,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and those of the surrounding air and of the surface on which it lands, in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: many different configurations. Admittedly, the initial ‘predictably heads’, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: snapshots are not microscopically identical either, because some heat is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: present there too, but the production of heat in the process means that these, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: snapshots are very much less diverse than the later ones. So each, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: homogeneous group of ‘predictably heads’ snapshots determines the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: existence of — and therefore causes — vast numbers of microscopically, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: different ‘heads’ snapshots. But no single ‘heads’ snapshot by itself, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: determines the existence of any ‘predictably heads’ snapshots, and so is not, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: a cause of them., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: The conversion, relative to any observer, of possibilities into actualities — of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: an open future into a fixed past — also makes sense in this framework., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Consider the coin-tossing example again. Before the coin toss, the future is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: open from the point of view of an observer, in the sense that it is still, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: possible that either outcome, ‘heads’ or ‘tails’, will be observed by that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: observer. From that observer’s point of view both outcomes are possibilities,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: even though objectively they are both actualities. After the coin has settled,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the copies of the observer have differentiated into two groups. Each, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: observer has observed, and remembers, only one outcome of the coin toss., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Thus the outcome, once it is in the past of any observer, has become single-, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: valued and actual for every copy of the observer, even though from the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: multiverse point of view it is just as two-valued as ever., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Let me sum up the elements of the quantum concept of time. Time is not a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: sequence of moments, nor does it flow. Yet our intuitions about the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: properties of time are broadly true. Certain events are indeed causes and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: effects of one another. Relative to an observer, the future is indeed open, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and the past fixed, and possibilities do indeed become actualities. The, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: reason why our traditional theories of time are nonsense is that they try to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: express these true intuitions within the framework of a false classical, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: physics. In quantum physics they make sense, because time was a quantum, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: concept all along. We exist in multiple versions, in universes called, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘moments’. Each version of us is not directly aware of the others, but has, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: evidence of their existence because physical laws link the contents of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: different universes. It is tempting to suppose that the moment of which we, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: are aware is the only real one, or is at least a little more real than the others., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: ‘calendar’ such as the shapes of the constellations in the night sky or the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: relative proportions of various radioactive elements in rocks. Physics, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: that the multiverse consists of a set of parallel spacetimes, each consisting, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of a stack of ‘snapshots’ of space, the date defined in this way is a property, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of an entire snapshot, and any two snapshots are separated by a time, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: interval which is the difference between their dates. Time travel is any, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: process that causes a disparity between, on the one hand, this interval, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: between two snapshots, and on the other, our own experience of how much, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: time has elapsed between our being in those two snapshots. We might refer, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to a clock that we carry with us, or we might estimate how much thinking we, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: have had the opportunity to do, or we might measure by physiological criteria, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: how much our bodies have aged. If we observe that a long time has passed, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: externally, while by all subjective measures we have experienced a much, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: shorter time, then we have travelled into the future. If, on the other hand, we, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: observe the external clocks and calendars indicating a particular time, and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: later (subjectively) we observe them consistently indicating an earlier time,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: then we have travelled into the past., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Most authors of science fiction realize that future- and past-directed time, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: travel are radically different sorts of process. I shall not give future-directed, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: time travel much attention here, because it is by far the less problematic, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: proposition. Even in everyday life, for example when we sleep and wake up,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: our subjectively experienced time can be shorter than the external elapsed, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: time. People who recover from comas lasting several years could be said to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: have travelled that many years into the future, were it not for the fact that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: their bodies have aged according to external time rather than the time they, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: experienced subjectively. So, in principle, a technique similar to that which, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: we envisaged in Chapter 5 for slowing down a virtual-reality user’s brain, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: could be applied to the whole body, and thus could be used for fully fledged, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: future-directed time travel. A less intrusive method is provided by Einstein’s, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: special theory of relativity, which says that in general an observer who, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: accelerates or decelerates experiences less time than an observer who is at, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: rest or in uniform motion. For example, an astronaut who went on a round-, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: trip involving acceleration to speeds close to that of light would experience, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: much less time than an observer who remained on Earth. This effect is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: known as time dilation. By accelerating enough, one can make the duration, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of the flight from the astronaut’s point of view as short as one likes, and the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: duration as measured on Earth as long as one likes. Thus one could travel, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: as far into the future as one likes in a given, subjectively short time. But such, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: a trip to the future is irreversible. The return journey would require past-, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: directed time travel, and no amount of time dilation can allow a spaceship to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: return from a flight before it took off., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Virtual reality and time travel have this, at least, in common: they both, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: systematically alter the usual relationship between external reality and the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: user’s experience of it. So one might ask this question: if a universal virtual-, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: reality generator could so easily be programmed to effect future-directed, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: time travel, is there a way of using it for past-directed time travel? For, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: instance, if slowing us down would send us into the future, would speeding, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: us up send us into the past? No; the outside world would merely seem to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: slow down. Even at the unattainable limit where the brain operated infinitely, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: fast, the outside world would appear frozen at a particular moment. That, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: would still be time travel, by the above definition, but it would not be past-, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: directed. One might call it ‘present-directed’ time travel. I remember wishing, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: for a machine capable of present-directed time travel when doing last-minute, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: revision for exams — what student has not?, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Before I discuss past-directed time travel itself, what about the rendering of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: past-directed time travel? To what extent could a virtual-reality generator be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: programmed to give the user the experience of past-directed time travel? We, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: shall see that the answer to this question, like all questions about the scope, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of virtual reality, tells us about physical reality as well., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: The distinctive aspects of experiencing a past environment are, by definition,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: experiences of certain physical objects or processes — ‘clocks’ and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘calendars’ — in states that occurred only at past times (that is, in past, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: snapshots). A virtual-reality generator could, of course, render those objects, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: in those states. For instance, it could give one the experience of living in the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: age of the dinosaurs, or in the trenches of the First World War, and it could, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: make the constellations, dates on newspapers or whatever, appear correctly, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: for those times. How correctly? Is there any fundamental limit on how, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: accurately any given era could be rendered? The Turing principle says that a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: universal virtual-reality generator can be built, and could be programmed to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: render any physically possible environment, so clearly it could be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: programmed to render any environment that did once exist physically., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: To render a time machine that had a certain repertoire of past destinations, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: (and therefore also to render the destinations themselves), the program, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: would have to include historical records of the environments at those, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: destinations. In fact, it would need more than mere records, because the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: experience of time travel would involve more than merely seeing past events, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: unfolding around one. Playing recordings of the past to the user would be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: mere image generation, not virtual reality. Since a real time traveller would, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: participate in events and act back upon the past environment, an accurate, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: virtual-reality rendering of a time machine, as of any environment, must be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: interactive. The program would have to calculate, for each action of the user,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: how the historical environment would have responded to that action. For, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: example, to convince Dr Johnson that a purported time machine really had, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: taken him to ancient Rome, we should have to allow him to do more than, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: just watch passively and invisibly as Julius Caesar walked by. He would, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: want to test the authenticity of his experiences by kicking the local rocks. He, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: might kick Caesar — or at least, address him in Latin and expect him to reply, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: in kind. What it means for a virtual-reality rendering of a time machine to be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: accurate is that the rendering should respond to such interactive tests in the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: same way as would the real time machine, and as would the real past, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: environments to which it travelled. That should include, in this case,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: displaying a correctly behaving, Latin-speaking rendering of Julius Caesar., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Since Julius Caesar and ancient Rome were physical objects, they could, in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: principle, be rendered with arbitrary accuracy. The task differs only in degree, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: from that of rendering the Centre Court at Wimbledon, including the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: spectators. Of course, the complexity of the requisite programs would be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: tremendous. More complex still, or perhaps even impossible in principle,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: would be the task of gathering the information required to write the programs, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to render specific human beings. But writing the programs is not the issue, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: here. I am not asking whether we can find out enough about a past, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: environment (or, indeed, about a present or future environment) to write a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: program that would render that environment specifically. I am asking, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: whether the set of all possible programs for virtual-reality generators does or, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: does not include one that gives a virtual-reality rendering of past-directed, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: time travel and, if so, how accurate that rendering can be. If there were no, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: programs rendering time travel, then the Turing principle would imply that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: time travel was physically impossible (because it says that everything that is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: physically possible can be rendered by some program). And on the face of it,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: there is indeed a problem here. Even though there are programs which, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: accurately render past environments, there appear to be fundamental, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: obstacles to using them to render time travel. These are the same obstacles, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that appear to prevent time travel itself, namely the so-called ‘paradoxes’ of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: time travel., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Here is a typical such paradox. I build a time machine and use it to travel, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: back into the past. There I prevent my former self from building the time, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: machine. But if the time machine is not built, I shall not be able to use it to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: travel into the past, nor therefore to prevent the time machine from being, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: built. So do I make this trip or not? If I do, then I deprive myself of the time, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: machine and therefore do not make the trip. If I do not make the trip, then I, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: allow myself to build the time machine and so do make the trip. This is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: sometimes called the ‘grandfather paradox’, and stated in terms of using, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: time travel to kill one’s grandfather before he had any children. (And then, if, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: he had no children, he could not have had any grandchildren, so who killed, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: him?) These two forms of the paradox are the ones most commonly cited,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and happen to require an element of violent conflict between the time, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: traveller and people in the past, so one finds oneself wondering who will win., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Perhaps the time traveller will be defeated, and the paradox avoided. But, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: violence is not an essential part of the problem here. If I had a time machine,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: I could decide as follows: that if, today, my future self visits me, having set, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: out from tomorrow, then tomorrow I shall not use my time machine; and that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: if I receive no such visitor today, then tomorrow I shall use the time machine, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to travel back to today and visit myself. It seems to follow from this decision, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that if I use the time machine then I shall not use it, and if I do not use it then, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: I shall use it: a contradiction., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: A contradiction indicates a faulty assumption, so such paradoxes have, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: traditionally been taken as proofs that time travel is impossible. Another, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: assumption that is sometimes challenged is that of free will — whether time, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: travellers can choose in the usual way how to behave. One then concludes, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that if time machines did exist, people’s free will would be impaired. They, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: would somehow be unable to form intentions of the type I have described; or, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: else, when they travelled in time, they would somehow systematically forget, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the resolutions they made before setting out. But it turns out that the faulty, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: assumption behind the paradoxes is neither the existence of a time machine, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: nor the ability of people to choose their actions in the usual way. All that is at, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: fault is the classical theory of time, which I have already shown, for quite, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: independent reasons, to be untenable., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: If time travel really were logically impossible, a virtual-reality rendering of it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: would also be impossible. If it required a suspension of free will, then so, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: would a virtual-reality rendering of it. The paradoxes of time travel can be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: expressed in virtual-reality terms as follows. The accuracy of a virtual-reality, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: rendering is the faithfulness, as far as is perceptible, of the rendered, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: environment to the intended one. In the case of time travel the intended, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: environment is one that existed historically. But as soon as the rendered, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: environment responds, as it is required to, to the user kicking it, it thereby, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: becomes historically inaccurate because the real environment never did, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: respond to the user: the user never did kick it. For example, the real Julius, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Caesar never met Dr Johnson. Consequently Dr Johnson, in the very act of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: testing the faithfulness of the rendering by conversing with Caesar, would, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: destroy that faithfulness by creating a historically inaccurate Caesar. A, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: rendering can behave accurately by being a faithful image of history, or it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: can respond accurately, but not both. Thus it would appear that, in one way, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: or the other, a virtual-reality rendering of time travel is intrinsically incapable, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of being accurate — which is another way of saying that time travel could not, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: be rendered in virtual reality., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: But is this effect really an impediment to the accurate rendering of time, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: travel? Normally, mimicking an environment’s actual behaviour is not the aim, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of virtual reality: what counts is that it should respond accurately. As soon as, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: you begin to play tennis on the rendered Wimbledon Centre Court, you, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: make it behave differently from the way the real one is behaving. But that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: does not make the rendering any less accurate. On the contrary, that is what, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: is required for accuracy. Accuracy, in virtual reality, means the closeness of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the rendered behaviour to that which the original environment would exhibit, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: if the user were present in it. Only at the beginning of the rendering does the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: rendered environment’s state have to be faithful to the original. Thereafter it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: is not its state but its responses to the user’s actions that have to be faithful., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Why is that ‘paradoxical’ for renderings of time travel but not for other, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: renderings — for instance, for renderings of ordinary travel?, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: It seems paradoxical because in renderings of past-directed time travel the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: user plays a unique double, or multiple, role. Because of the looping that is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: involved, where for instance one or more copies of the user may co-exist, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and interact, the virtual-reality generator is in effect required to render the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: user while simultaneously responding to the user’s actions. For example, let, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: us imagine that I am the user of a virtual-reality generator running a time-, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: travel-rendering program. Suppose that when I switch on the program, the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: environment that I see around me is a futuristic laboratory. In the middle, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: there is a revolving door, like those at the entrances of large buildings,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: except that this one is opaque and is almost entirely enclosed in an opaque, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: cylinder. The only way in or out of the cylinder is a single entrance cut in its, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: side. The door within revolves continuously. It seems at first sight that there, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: is little one can do with this device except to enter it, go round one or more, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: times with the revolving door, and come out again. But above the entrance is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: a sign: ‘Pathway to the Past’. It is a time machine, a fictional, virtual-reality, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: one. But if a real past-directed time machine existed it would, like this one,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: not be an exotic sort of vehicle but an exotic sort of place. Rather than drive, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: or fly it to the past, one would take a certain path through it (perhaps using, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: an ordinary space vehicle) and emerge at an earlier time., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: it is at ‘interaction off’. This setting does not allow the user to participate in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: the past, but only to observe it. In other words, it does not provide a full, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: virtual-reality rendering of the past environment, but only image generation., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: With this simpler setting at least, there is no ambiguity or paradox about, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: what images ought to be generated when I emerge from the revolving door., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: They are images of me, in the laboratory, doing what I did at noon. One, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: reason why there is no ambiguity is that I can remember those events, so I, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: can test the images of the past against my own recollection of what, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: happened. By restricting our analysis to a small, closed environment over a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: short period, we have avoided the problem analogous to that of finding out, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: what Julius Caesar was really like, which is a problem about the ultimate, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: limits of archaeology rather than about the inherent problems of time travel., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: In our case, the virtual-reality generator can easily obtain the information it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: needs to generate the required images, by making a recording of everything, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: I do. Not, that is, a recording of what I do in physical reality (which is simply, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to lie still inside the virtual-reality generator), but of what I do in the virtual, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: environment of the laboratory. Thus, the moment I emerge from the time, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: machine, the virtual-reality generator ceases to render the laboratory at five, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: minutes past noon, and starts to play back its recording, starting with images, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of what happened at noon. It displays this recording to me with the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: perspective adjusted for my present position and where I am looking, and it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: continuously readjusts the perspective in the usual way as I move. Thus, I, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: see the clock showing noon again. I also see my earlier self, standing in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: front of the time machine, reading the sign above the entrance and studying, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the instructions, exactly as I did five minutes ago. I see him, but he cannot, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: see me. No matter what I do, he — or rather it, the moving image of me —, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: be an inaccurate image. There are many ways in which an image generator, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: can be programmed to handle a situation where an image of a solid object, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: has to pass through the user’s location. For instance, the image could pass, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: straight through like a ghost, or it could push the user irresistibly away. The, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: latter option gives a more accurate rendering because then the images are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to some extent tactile as well as visual. There need be no danger of my, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: getting hurt as my image knocks me aside, however abruptly, because of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: course I am not physically there. If there is not enough room for me to get, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: out of the way, the virtual-reality generator could make me flow effortlessly, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: through a narrow gap, or even teleport me past an obstacle., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: It is not only the image of myself on which I can have no further effect., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Because we have temporarily switched from virtual reality to image, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: generation, I can no longer affect anything in the simulated environment. If, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: there is a glass of water on a table I can no longer pick it up and drink it, as I, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: could have before I passed through the revolving door to the simulated past., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: By requesting a simulation of non-interactive, past-directed time travel, which, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: is effectively a playback of specific events five minutes ago, I necessarily, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: relinquish control over my environment. I cede control, as it were, to my, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: former self., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: As my image enters the revolving door, the time according to the clock has, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: once again reached five minutes past twelve, though it is ten minutes into, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: the simulation according to my subjective perception. What happens next, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: depends on what I do. If I just stay in the laboratory, the virtual-reality, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: generator’s next task must be to place me at events that occur after five, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: minutes past twelve, laboratory time. It does not yet have any recordings of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: such events, nor do I have any memories of them. Relative to me, relative to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the simulated laboratory and relative to physical reality, those events have, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: not yet happened, so the virtual-reality generator can resume its fully, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: interactive rendering. The net effect is of my having spent five minutes in the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: past without being able to affect it, and then returning to the ‘present’ that I, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: had left, that is, to the normal sequence of events which I can affect., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Alternatively, I can follow my image into the time machine, travel round the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: time machine with my image and emerge again into the laboratory’s past., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: What happens then? Again, the clock says twelve noon. Now I can see two, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: images of my former self. One of them is seeing the time machine for the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: first time, and notices neither me nor the other image. The second image, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: appears to see the first but not me. I can see both of them. Only the first, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: image appears to affect anything in the laboratory. This time, from the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: virtual-reality generator’s point of view, nothing special has happened at the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: moment of time travel. It is still at the ‘interaction off’ setting, and is simply, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: continuing to play back images of events five minutes earlier (from my, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: subjective point of view), and these have now reached the moment when I, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: began to see an image of myself., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: After another five minutes have passed I can again choose whether to re-, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: enter the time machine, this time in the company of two images of myself, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: (Figure 12.2). If I repeat the process, then after every five subjective minutes, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: an additional image of me will appear. Each image will appear to see all the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ones that appeared earlier than itself (in my experience), but none of those, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that appeared later than itself., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: If I continue the experience for as long as possible, the maximum number of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: copies of me that can co-exist will be limited only by the image generator’s, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: collision avoidance strategy. Let us assume that it tries to make it realistically, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: difficult for me to squeeze myself into the revolving door with all my images., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Then eventually I shall be forced to do something other than travel back to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the past with them. I could wait a little, and take the compartment after, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theirs, in which case I should reach the laboratory a moment after they do., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: But that just postpones the problem of overcrowding in the time machine. If I, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: keep going round this loop, eventually all the ‘slots’ for time travelling into the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: period of five minutes after noon will be filled, forcing me to let myself reach, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: a later time from which there will be no further means of returning to that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: period. This too is a property that time machines would have if they existed, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: physically. Not only are they places, they are places with a finite capacity for, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: supporting through traffic into the past., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text:   , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Another consequence of the fact that time machines are not vehicles, but, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: places or paths, is that one is not completely free to choose which time to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: only to travel to times and places at which it has existed. In particular, one, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: cannot use it to travel back to a time before its construction was completed., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: The virtual-reality generator now has recordings of many different versions of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: what happened in that laboratory between noon and five minutes past., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Which one depicts the real history? We ought not be too concerned if there, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: is no answer to this question, for it asks what is real in a situation where we, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: have artificially suppressed interactivity, making Dr Johnson’s test, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: inapplicable. One could argue that only the last version, the one depicting, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the most copies of me, is the real one, because the previous versions all in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: effect show history from the point of view of people who, by the artificial rule, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of non-interaction, were prevented from fully seeing what was happening., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Alternatively, one could argue that the first version of events, the one with a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: single copy of me, is the only real one because it is the only one I, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: experienced interactively. The whole point of non-interactivity is that we are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: temporarily preventing ourselves from changing the past, and since, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: subsequent versions all differ from the first one, they do not depict the past., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: All they depict is someone viewing the past by courtesy of a universal image, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: generator., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: One could also argue that all the versions are equally real. After all, when it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: is all over I remember having experienced not just one history of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: laboratory during that five-minute period, but several such histories. I, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: experienced them successively, but from the laboratory’s point of view they, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: all happened during the same five-minute period. The full record of my, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: experience requires many snapshots of the laboratory for each clock-defined, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: instant, instead of the usual single snapshot per instant. In other words, this, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: was a rendering of parallel universes. It turns out that this last interpretation, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: is the closest to the truth, as we can see by trying the same experiment, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: again, this time with interaction switched on., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: The first thing I want to say about the interactive mode, in which I am free to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: affect the environment, is that one of the things I can choose to make, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: happen is the exact sequence of events I have just described for the non-, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: interactive mode. That is, I can go back and encounter one or more copies, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of myself, yet nevertheless (if I am a good enough actor) behave exactly as, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: though I could not see some of them. Nevertheless, I must watch them, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: carefully. If I want to recreate the sequence of events that occurred when I, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: did this experiment with interaction switched off, I must remember what the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: copies of me do so that I can do it myself on subsequent visits to this time., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: At the beginning of the session, when I first see the time machine, I, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: immediately see it disgorging one or more copies of me. Why? Because with, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: interaction switched on, when I come to use the time machine at five minutes, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: past noon I shall have the right to affect the past to which I return, and that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: past is what is happening now, at noon. Thus my future self or selves are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: arriving to exercise their right to affect the laboratory at noon, and to affect, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: me, and in particular to be seen by me., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: The copies of me go about their business. Consider the computational task, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that the virtual-reality generator has to execute, in rendering these copies., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: There is now a new element that makes this overwhelmingly more difficult, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: than it was in the non-interactive mode. How is the virtual-reality generator to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: find out what the copies of me are going to do? It does not yet have any, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: recordings of that information, for in physical time the session has only just, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: begun. Yet it must immediately present me with renderings of my future self., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: So long as I am resolved to pretend that I cannot see these renderings, and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: then to mimic whatever I see them do, they are not going to be subjected to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: too stringent a test of accuracy. The virtual-reality generator need only make, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: them do something — anything that I might do; or more precisely any, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: behaviour that I am capable of mimicking. Given the technology that we are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: assuming the virtual-reality generator to be based on, that would presumably, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: not be exceeding its capabilities. It has an accurate mathematical model of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: my body, and a degree of direct access to my brain. It can use these to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: calculate some behaviour which I could mimic, and then have its initial, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: renderings of me carry out that behaviour., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: So I begin the experience by seeing some copies of me emerge from the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: revolving door and do something. I pretend not to notice them, and after five, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: minutes I go round the revolving door myself and mimic what I earlier saw, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the first copy doing. Five minutes later I go round again and mimic the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: second copy, and so on. Meanwhile, I notice that one of the copies always, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: repeats what I had been doing during the first five minutes. At the end of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: time-travelling sequence, the virtual-reality generator will again have several, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: records of what happened during the five minutes after noon, but this time all, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: those records will be identical. In other words, only one history happened,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: namely that I met my future self but pretended not to notice. Later I became, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that future self, travelled back in time to meet my past self, and was, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: apparently not noticed. That is all very tidy and non-paradoxical — and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: unrealistic. It was achieved by the virtual-reality generator and me engaging, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: in an intricate, mutually referential game: I was mimicking it while it was, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mimicking me. But with normal interactions switched on, I can choose not to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: play that game., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: If I really had access to virtual-reality time travel, I should certainly want to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: test the authenticity of the rendering. In the case we are discussing, the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: testing would begin as soon as I saw the copies of me. Far from ignoring, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: them, I would immediately engage them in conversation. I am far better, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: equipped to test their authenticity than Dr Johnson would be to test Julius, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Caesar’s. To pass even this initial test, the rendered versions of me would, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: effectively have to be artificial intelligent beings — moreover, beings so, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: similar to me, at least in their responses to external stimuli, that they can, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: convince me they are accurate renderings of how I might be five minutes, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: from now. The virtual-reality generator must be running programs similar in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: content and complexity to my mind. Once again, the difficulty of writing such, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: programs is not the issue here: we are investigating the principle of virtual-, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: reality time travel, not its practicality. It does not matter where our, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: hypothetical virtual-reality generator gets its programs, for we are asking, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: whether the set of all possible programs does or does not include one that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: accurately renders time travel. But our virtual-reality generator does in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: principle have the means of discovering all the possible ways I might behave, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: in various situations. This information is located in the physical state of my, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: brain, and sufficiently precise measurements could in principle read it out., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: One (probably unacceptable) method of doing this would be for the virtual-, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: reality generator to cause my brain to interact, in virtual reality, with a test, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: environment, record its behaviour and then restore its original state, perhaps, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: by running it backwards. The reason why this is probably unacceptable is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that I would presumably experience that test environment, and though I, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: should not recall it afterwards, I want the virtual-reality generator to give me, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the experiences I specify and no others., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: In any case, what matters for present purposes is that, since my brain is a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: physical object, the Turing principle says that it is within the repertoire of a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: universal virtual-reality generator. So it is possible in principle for the copy of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: me to pass the test of whether he accurately resembles me. But that is not, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the only test I want to perform. Mainly, I want to test whether the time travel, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: itself is being rendered authentically. To that end I want to find out not just, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: whether this person is authentically me, but whether he is authentically from, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the future. In part I can test this by questioning him. He should say that he, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: remembers being in my position five minutes ago, and that he then travelled, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: around the revolving door and met me. I should also find that he is testing, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: my authenticity. Why would he do that? Because the most stringent and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: straightforward way in which I could test his resemblance to the future me, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: would be to wait until I have passed through the time machine, and then look, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: for two things: first, whether the copy of me whom I find there behaves as I, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: remember myself behaving; and second, whether I behave as I remember, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the copy behaving., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: In both these respects the rendering will certainly fail the test! At my very first, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and slightest attempt to behave differently from the way I remember my copy, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: behaving, I shall succeed. And it will be almost as easy to make him behave, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: differently from the way in which I behaved: all I have to do is ask him a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: question which I, in his place, had not been asked, and which has a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: distinctive answer. So however much they resemble me in appearance and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: personality, the people who emerge from the virtual-reality time machine are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: not authentic renderings of the person I am shortly to become. Nor should, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: they be — after all, I have the firm intention not to behave as they do when it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: is my turn to use the time machine and, since the virtual-reality generator is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: now allowing me to interact freely with the rendered environment, there is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: nothing to prevent me from carrying out that intention., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Let me recap. As the experiment begins I meet a person who is recognizably, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: me, apart from slight variations. Those variations consistently point to his, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: being from the future: he remembers the laboratory at five minutes past, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: noon, a time which, from my perspective, has not happened yet. He, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: remembers setting out at that time, passing through the revolving door and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: arriving at noon. He remembers, before all that, beginning this experiment at, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: noon and seeing the revolving door for the first time, and seeing copies of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: himself emerging. He says that this happened over five minutes ago,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: according to his subjective perception, though according to mine the whole, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: experiment has not yet lasted five minutes. And so on. Yet though he passes, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: all tests for being a version of me from the future, it is demonstrably not my, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: future. When I test whether he is the specific person I am going to become,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: he fails that test. Similarly, he tells me that I fail the test for being his past, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: self, since I am not doing exactly what he remembers himself doing., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: So when I travel to the laboratory’s past, I find that it is not the same past as, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: I have just come from. Because of his interaction with me, the copy of me, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: whom I find there does not behave quite as I remember behaving., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Therefore, if the virtual-reality generator were to record the totality of what, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: happens during this time-travel sequence, it would again have to store, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: several snapshots for each instant as defined by the laboratory clock, and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: this time they would all be different. In other words, there would be several, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: distinct, parallel histories of the laboratory during the five-minute time-, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: travelling period. Again, I have experienced each of these histories in turn., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: But this time I have experienced them all interactively, so there is no excuse, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: for saying that any of them are less real than the others. So what is being, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: rendered here is a little multiverse. If this were physical time travel, the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: multiple snapshots at each instant would be parallel universes. Given the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: quantum concept of time, we should not be surprised at this. We know that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the snapshots which stack themselves approximately into a single time, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: sequence in our everyday experience are in fact parallel universes. We do, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: not normally experience the other parallel universes that exist at the same, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: time, but we have reason to believe that they are there. So, if we find some, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: method, as yet unspecified, of travelling to an earlier time, why should we, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: expect that method necessarily to take each copy of us to the particular, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: snapshot which that copy had already experienced? Why should we expect, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: every visitor we receive from the future to hail from the particular future, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: snapshots in which we shall eventually find ourselves? We really should not, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: expect this. Asking to be allowed to interact with the past environment, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: means asking to change it, which means by definition asking to be in a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: different snapshot of it from the one we remember. A time traveller would, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: return to the same snapshot (or, what is perhaps the same thing, to an, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: identical snapshot) only in the extremely contrived case I discussed above,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: where no effective interaction takes place between the copies who meet,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and the time traveller manages to make all the parallel histories identical., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Now let me subject the virtual-reality time machine to the ultimate test. Let, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: me deliberately set out to enact a paradox. I form the firm intention that I, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: stated above: I resolve that if a copy of me emerges at noon from the time, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: machine, then I shall not enter it at five minutes past noon, or indeed at any, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: time during the experiment. But if no one emerges, then at five minutes past, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: noon I shall enter the time machine, emerge at noon, and then not use the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: time machine again. What happens? Will someone emerge from the time, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: machine or not? Yes. And no! It depends which universe we are talking, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: about. Remember that more than one thing happens in that laboratory at, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: noon. Suppose that I see no one emerging from the time machine, as, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: illustrated at the point marked ‘Start’ at the right of Figure 12.3. Then, acting, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: on my firm intention, I wait until five minutes past noon and then walk round, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that now-familiar revolving door. Emerging at noon, I find, of course, another, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: version of myself, standing at the point marked ‘Start’ on the left of Figure, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: 12.3. As we converse, we find that he and I had formed the same intention., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Therefore, because I have emerged into his universe, he will behave, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: differently from the way I behaved. Acting on the same intention as mine, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: leads him not to use the time machine. From then on, he and I can continue, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to interact for as long as the simulation lasts, and there will be two versions, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of me in that universe. In the universe I came from, the laboratory remains, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: empty after five minutes past twelve, for I never return to it. We have, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: encountered no paradox. Both versions of me have succeeded in enacting, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: our shared intention — which was therefore not, after all, logically incapable, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of being carried out., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: I and my alter ego in this experiment have had different experiences. He saw, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: someone emerging from the time machine at noon, and I did not. Our, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: experiences would have been equally faithful to our intention, and equally, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: non-paradoxical, had our roles been reversed. That is, I could have seen, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: him emerging from the time machine at noon, and then not used it myself. In, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that case both of us would have ended up in the universe I started in. In the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: universe he started in, the laboratory would remain empty., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Which of these two self-consistent possibilities will the virtual-reality, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: generator show me? During this rendering of an intrinsically multiversal, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: process, I play only one of the two copies of me; the program renders the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: other copy. At the beginning of the experiment the two copies look identical, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: (though in physical reality they are different because only one of them is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: connected to a physical brain and body outside the virtual environment). But, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: in the physical version of the experiment — if a time machine existed, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: physically — the two universes containing the copies of me who were going, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to meet would initially be strictly identical, and both copies would be equally, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: real. At the multiverse-moment when we met (in one universe) or did not, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: meet (in the other), those two copies would become different. It is not, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: meaningful to ask which copy of me would have which experience: so long, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: as we are identical, there is no such thing as ‘which’ of us. Parallel universes, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: do not have hidden serial numbers: they are distinguished only by what, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: happens in them. Therefore in rendering all this for the benefit of one copy of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: me, the virtual-reality generator must recreate for me the effect of existing as, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: two identical copies who then become different and have different, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: experiences. It can cause that literally to happen by choosing at random,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: with equal probabilities, which of the two roles it will play (and therefore,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: given my intention, which role I shall play). For choosing randomly means in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: effect tossing some electronic version of a fair coin, and a fair coin is one, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that shows ‘heads’ in half the universes in which it is tossed and ‘tails’ in the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: other half. So in half the universes I shall play one role, and in the other half,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the other. That is exactly what would happen with a real time machine., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:   , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: We have seen that a virtual-reality generator’s ability to render time travel, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: accurately depends on its having detailed information about the user’s state, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of mind. This may make one briefly wonder whether the paradoxes have, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: been genuinely avoided. If the virtual-reality generator knows what I am, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: going to do in advance, am I really free to perform whatever tests I choose?, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: We need not get into any deep questions about the nature of free will here. I, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: am indeed free to do whatever I like in this experiment, in the sense that for, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: every possible way I may choose to react to the simulated past — including, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: randomly, if I want to — the virtual-reality generator allows me to react in that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: way. And all the environments I interact with are affected by what I do, and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: react back on me in precisely the way they would if time travel were not, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: taking place. The reason why the virtual-reality generator needs information, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: from my brain is not to predict my actions, but to render the behaviour of my, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: counterparts from other universes. Its problem is that in the real version of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: this situation there would be parallel-universe counterparts of me, initially, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: identical and therefore possessing the same propensities as me and making, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the same decisions. (Farther away in the multiverse there would also be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: others who were already different from me at the outset of the experiment,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: but a time machine would never cause me to meet those versions.) If there, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: were some other way of rendering these people, the virtual-reality generator, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: would not need any information from my brain, nor would it need the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: prodigious computational resources that we have been envisaging. For, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: example, if some people who know me well were able to mimic me to some, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: degree of accuracy (apart from external attributes such as appearance and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: tone of voice, which are relatively trivial to render) then the virtual-reality, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: generator could use those people to act out the roles of my parallel-universe, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: counterparts, and could thereby render time travel to that same degree of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: accuracy., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: A real time machine, of course, would not face these problems. It would, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: simply provide pathways along which I and my counterparts, who already, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: existed, could meet, and it would constrain neither our behaviour nor our, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: interactions when we did meet. The ways in which the pathways, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: interconnect — that is, which snapshots the time machine would lead to —, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: would be affected by my physical state, including my state of mind. That is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: no different from the usual situation, in which my physical state, as reflected, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: in my propensity to behave in various ways, affects what happens. The great, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: difference between this and everyday experience is that each copy of me is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: potentially having a large effect on other universes (by travelling to them)., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Does being able to travel to the past of other universes, but not our own,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: really amount to time travel? Is it just inter-universe travel that makes sense,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: rather than time travel? No. The processes I have been describing really are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: time travel. First of all, it is not the case that we cannot travel to a snapshot, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: where we have already been. If we arrange things correctly, we can. Of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: course if we change anything in the past — if we make it different from how it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: was in the past we came from — then we find ourselves in a different past., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Fully fledged time travel would allow us to change the past. In other words, it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: allows us to make the past different from the way we remember it (in this, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: universe). That means different from the way it actually is, in the snapshots, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: in which we did not arrive to change anything. And those include, by, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: definition, the snapshots we remember being in., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: So wanting to change the specific past snapshots in which we once were, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: does indeed not make sense. But that has nothing to do with time travel. It is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: a nonsense that stems directly from the nonsensical classical theory of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: flow of time. Changing the past means choosing which past snapshot to be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: in, not changing any specific past snapshot into another one. In this respect,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: changing the past is no different from changing the future, which we do all, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the time. Whenever we make a choice, we change the future: we change it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: from what it would have been had we chosen differently. Such an idea would, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: make no sense in classical, spacetime physics with its single future, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: determined by the present. But it does make sense in quantum physics., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: When we make a choice, we change the future from what it will be in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: universes in which we choose differently. But in no case does any particular, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: snapshot in the future change. It cannot change, for there is no flow of time, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: with respect to which it could change. ‘Changing’ the future means choosing, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: which snapshot we will be in; ‘changing’ the past means exactly the same, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: thing. Because there is no flow of time, there is no such thing as changing a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: particular past snapshot, such as one we remember being in. Nevertheless,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: if we somehow gain physical access to the past, there is no reason why we, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: could not change it in precisely the sense in which we change the future,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: namely by choosing to be in a different snapshot from the one we would, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: have been in if we had chosen differently., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Arguments from virtual reality help in understanding time travel because the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: concept of virtual reality requires one to take ‘counter-factual events’, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: seriously, and therefore the multi-universe quantum concept of time seems, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: natural when it is rendered in virtual reality. By seeing that past-directed time, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: travel is within the repertoire of a universal virtual-reality generator, we learn, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that the idea of past-directed time travel makes perfect sense. But that is not, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to say that it is necessarily physically achievable. After all, faster-than-light, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: travel, perpetual motion machines and many other physical impossibilities, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: are all possible in virtual reality. No amount of reasoning about virtual reality, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: can prove that a given process is permitted by the laws of physics (though it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: can prove that it is not: if we had reached the contrary conclusion, it would, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: have implied, via the Turing principle, that time travel cannot occur, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: physically). So what do our positive conclusions about virtual-reality time, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: travel tell us about physics?, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: They tell us what time travel would look like if it did occur. They tell us that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: past-directed time travel would inevitably be a process set in several, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: interacting and interconnected universes. In that process, the participants, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: would in general travel from one universe to another whenever they travelled, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: in time. The precise ways in which the universes were connected would, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: depend, among other things, on the participants’ states of mind., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: So, for time travel to be physically possible it is necessary for there to be a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: multiverse. And it is necessary that the physical laws governing the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: multiverse be such that, in the presence of a time machine and potential, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: time travellers, the universes become interconnected in the way I have, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: described, and not in any other way. For example, if I am not going to use a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: time machine come what may, then no time-travelling versions of me must, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: appear in my snapshot; that is, no universes in which versions of me do use, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: a time machine can become connected to my universe. If I am definitely, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: going to use the time machine, then my universe must become connected to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: another universe in which I also definitely use it. And if I am going to try to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: enact a ‘paradox’ then, as we have seen, my universe must become, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: connected with another one in which a copy of me has the same intention as, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: I do, but by carrying out that intention ends up behaving differently from me., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Remarkably, all this is precisely what quantum theory does predict. In short,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the result is that if pathways into the past do exist, travellers on them are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: free to interact with their environment in just the same way as they could if, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the pathways did not lead into the past. In no case does time travel become, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: inconsistent, or impose special constraints on time travellers’ behaviour., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: That leaves us with the question whether it is physically possible for, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: pathways into the past to exist. This question has been the subject of much, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: research, and is still highly controversial. The usual starting-point is a set of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: equations which form the (predictive) basis of Einstein’s general theory of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: relativity, currently our best theory of space and time. These equations,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: known as Einstein’s equations, have many solutions, each describing a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: possible four-dimensional configuration of space, time and gravity. Einstein’s, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: equations certainly permit the existence of pathways into the past; many, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: solutions with that property have been discovered. Until recently, the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: accepted practice has been systematically to ignore such solutions. But this, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: has not been for any reason arising from within the theory, nor from any, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: argument within physics at all. It has been because physicists were under, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the impression that time travel would ‘lead to paradoxes’, and that such, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: solutions of Einstein’s equations must therefore be ‘unphysical’. This, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: arbitrary second-guessing is reminiscent of what happened in the early years, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of general relativity, when the solutions describing the Big Bang and an, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: expanding universe were rejected by Einstein himself. He tried to change the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: equations so that they would describe a static universe instead. Later he, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: referred to this as the biggest mistake of his life, and the expansion was, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: verified experimentally by the American astronomer Edwin Hubble. For many, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: years also, the solutions obtained by the German astronomer Karl, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Schwarzschild, which were the first to describe black holes, were mistakenly, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: rejected as ‘unphysical’. They described counter-intuitive phenomena, such, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: as a region from which it is in principle impossible to escape, and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: gravitational forces becoming infinite at the black hole’s centre. The, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: prevailing view nowadays is that black holes do exist, and do have the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: properties predicted by Einstein’s equations., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: Taken literally, Einstein’s equations predict that travel into the past would be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: possible in the vicinity of massive, spinning objects, such as black holes, if, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: they spun fast enough, and in certain other situations. But many physicists, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: doubt that these predictions are realistic. No sufficiently rapidly spinning, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: black holes are known, and it has been argued (inconclusively) that it may, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: be impossible to spin one up artificially, because any rapidly spinning, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: material that one fired in might be thrown off and be unable to enter the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: black hole. The sceptics may be right, but in so far as their reluctance to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: accept the possibility of time travel is rooted in a belief that it leads to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: paradoxes, it is unjustified., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Even when Einstein’s equations have been more fully understood, they will, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: not provide conclusive answers on the subject of time travel. The general, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theory of relativity predates quantum theory and is not wholly compatible, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: with it. No one has yet succeeded in formulating a satisfactory quantum, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: version — a quantum theory of gravity. Yet, from the arguments I have, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: given, quantum effects would be dominant in time-travelling situations., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Typical candidate versions of a quantum theory of gravity not only allow, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: past-directed connections to exist in the multiverse, they predict that such, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: connections are continually forming and breaking spontaneously. This is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: happening throughout space and time, but only on a sub-microscopic scale., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: The typical pathway formed by these effects is about 10 –35  metres across,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: remains open for one Planck time (about 10 –43  seconds), and therefore, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: reaches only about one Planck time into the past., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Future-directed time travel, which essentially requires only efficient rockets,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: is on the moderately distant but confidently foreseeable technological, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: horizon. Past-directed time travel, which requires the manipulation of black, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: holes, or some similarly violent gravitational disruption of the fabric of space, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and time, will be practicable only in the remote future, if at all. At present we, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: know of nothing in the laws of physics that rules out past-directed time travel;, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: on the contrary, they make it plausible that time travel is possible. Future, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: discoveries in fundamental physics may change this. It may be discovered, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that quantum fluctuations in space and time become overwhelmingly strong, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: near time machines, and effectively seal off their entrances (Stephen, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Hawking, for one, has argued that some calculations of his make this likely,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: but his argument is inconclusive). Or some hitherto unknown phenomenon, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: may rule out past-directed time travel — or provide a new and easier method, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of achieving it. One cannot predict the future growth of knowledge. But if the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: future development of fundamental physics continues to allow time travel in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: principle, then its practical attainment will surely become a mere, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: technological problem that will eventually be solved., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Because no time machine provides pathways to times earlier than the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: moment at which it came into existence, and because of the way in which, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: quantum theory says that universes are interconnected, there are some, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: limits to what we can expect to learn by using time machines. Once we have, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: built one, but not before, we may expect visitors, or at least messages, from, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the future to emerge from it. What will they tell us? One thing they will, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: certainly not tell us is news of our own future. The deterministic nightmare of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the prophecy of an inescapable future doom, brought about in spite of — or, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: perhaps as the very consequence of — our attempts to avoid it, is the stuff, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of myth and science fiction only. Visitors from the future cannot know our, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: future any more than we can, for they did not come from there. But they can, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: tell us about the future of their universe, whose past was identical to ours., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: They can bring taped news and current affairs programmes, and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: made some mistaken decision, which led to disaster, they can warn us of it., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: We may or may not follow their advice. If we follow it, we may avoid the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: disaster, or — there can be no guarantees — we may find that the result is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: even worse than what happened to them., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: On average, though, we should presumably benefit greatly from studying, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: their future history. Although it is not our future history, and although, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: knowing of a possible impending disaster is not the same thing as knowing, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: what to do about it, we should presumably learn much from such a detailed, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: record of what, from our point of view, might happen., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Our visitors might bring details of great scientific and artistic achievements. If, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: these were made in the near future of the other universe, it is likely that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: counterparts of the people who made them would exist in our universe, and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: might already be working towards those achievements. All at once, they, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: would be presented with completed versions of their work. Would they be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: grateful? There is another apparent time-travel paradox here. Since it does, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: not appear to create inconsistencies, but merely curiosities, it has been, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: discussed more in fiction than in scientific arguments against time travel, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: (though some philosophers, such as Michael Dummett, have taken it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: seriously). I call it the knowledge paradox of time travel; here is how the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: story typically goes. A future historian with an interest in Shakespeare uses a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: version, the time traveller is puzzled by not being able to locate, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Shakespeare at all. Through some chain of accidents, he finds himself, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: never had been another one., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: Incidentally, the time machine in these stories would have to be provided by, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: some extraterrestrial civilization which had already achieved time travel by, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Shakespeare’s day, and which was willing to allow our historian to use one, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of their scarce, non-renewable slots for travelling back to that time. Or, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: perhaps (even less likely, I guess) there might be a usable, naturally, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: occurring time machine in the vicinity of some black hole., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: All these stories relate a perfectly consistent chain — or rather, circle — of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: events. The reason why they are puzzling, and deserve to be called, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: paradoxes, lies elsewhere. It is that in each story great literature comes into, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: existence without anyone having written it: no one originally wrote it, no one, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: has created it. And that proposition, though logically consistent, profoundly, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: contradicts our understanding of where knowledge comes from. According to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the epistemological principles I set out in Chapter 3, knowledge does not, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: come into existence fully formed. It exists only as the result of creative, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: processes, which are step-by-step, evolutionary processes, always starting, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: with a problem and proceeding with tentative new theories, criticism and the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: elimination of errors to a new and preferable problem-situation. This is how, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Shakespeare wrote his plays. It is how Einstein discovered his field, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: equations. It is how all of us succeed in solving any problem, large or small,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: in our lives, or in creating anything of value., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: It is also how new living species come into existence. The analogue of a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘problem’ in this case is an ecological niche. The ‘theories’ are genes, and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the tentative new theories are mutated genes. The ‘criticism’ and ‘elimination, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of errors’ are natural selection. Knowledge is created by intentional human, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: action, biological adaptations by a blind, mindless mechanism. The words, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: we use to describe the two processes are different, and the processes are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: physically dissimilar too, but the detailed laws of epistemology that govern, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: them both are the same. In one case they are called Popper’s theory of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: growth of scientific knowledge; in the other, Darwin’s theory of evolution., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: One could formulate a knowledge paradox just as well in terms of living, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: species. Say we take some mammals in a time machine to the age of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: dinosaurs, when no mammals had yet evolved. We release our mammals., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: The dinosaurs die out and our mammals take over. Thus new species have, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: come into existence without having evolved. It is even easier to see why this, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: version is philosophically unacceptable: it implies a non-Darwinian origin of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: species, and specifically creationism. Admittedly, no Creator in the traditional, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: sense is invoked. Nevertheless, the origin of species in this story is distinctly, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: supernatural: the story gives no explanation — and rules out the possibility, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of there being an explanation — of how the specific and complex, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: adaptations of the species to their niches got there., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: In this way, knowledge-paradox situations violate epistemological or, if you, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: like, evolutionary principles. They are paradoxical only because they involve, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the creation, out of nothing, of complex human knowledge or of complex, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: biological adaptations. Analogous stories with other sorts of object or, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: information on the loop are not paradoxical. Observe a pebble on a beach;, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: then travel back to yesterday, locate the pebble elsewhere and move it to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: where you are going to find it. Why did you find it at that particular location?, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Because you moved it there. Why did you move it there? Because you found, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: it there. You have caused some information (the position of the pebble) to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: come into existence on a self-consistent loop. But so what? The pebble had, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to be somewhere. Provided the story does not involve getting something for, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: nothing, by way of knowledge or adaptation, it is no paradox., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: In the multiverse view, the time traveller who visits Shakespeare has not, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: come from the future of that copy of Shakespeare. He can affect, or perhaps, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: replace, the copy he visits. But he can never visit the copy who existed in the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: universe he started from. And it is that copy who wrote the plays. So the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: plays had a genuine author, and there are no paradoxical loops of the kind, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: envisaged in the story. Knowledge and adaptation are, even in the presence, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of pathways to the past, brought into existence only incrementally, by acts of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: human creativity or biological evolution, and in no other way., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: I wish I could report that this requirement is also rigorously implemented by, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the laws that quantum theory imposes on the multiverse. I expect it is, but, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: this is hard to prove because it is hard to express the desired property in the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: current language of theoretical physics. What mathematical formula, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: distinguishes ‘knowledge’ or ‘adaptation’ from worthless information? What, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: physical attributes distinguish a ‘creative’ process from a non-creative one?, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Although we cannot yet answer these questions, I do not think that the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: situation is hopeless. Remember the conclusions of Chapter 8, about the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: significance of life, and of knowledge, in the multiverse. I pointed out there, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: (for reasons quite unconnected with time travel) that knowledge creation and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: biological evolution are physically significant processes. And one of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: reasons was that those processes, and only those, have a particular effect, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: on parallel universes — namely to create trans-universe structure by making, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: them become alike. When, one day, we understand the details of this effect,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: we may be able to define knowledge, adaptation, creativity and evolution in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: terms of the convergence of universes., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: When I ‘enact a paradox’, there are eventually two copies of me in one, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: universe and none in the other. It is a general rule that after time travel has, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: taken place the total number of copies of me, counted across all universes,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: is unchanged. Similarly, the usual conservation laws for mass, energy and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: other physical quantities continue to hold for the multiverse as a whole,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: though not necessarily in any one universe. However, there is no, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: conservation law for knowledge. Possession of a time machine would allow, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: us access to knowledge from an entirely new source, namely the creativity of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: minds in other universes. They could also receive knowledge from us, so, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: one can loosely speak of a ‘trade’ in knowledge — and indeed a trade in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: artefacts embodying knowledge — across many universes. But one cannot, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: take that analogy too literally. The multiverse will never be a free-trade area, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: because the laws of quantum mechanics impose drastic restrictions on, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: which snapshots can be connected to which others. For one thing, two, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: universes first become connected only at a moment when they are identical:, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: becoming connected makes them begin to diverge. It is only when those, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: differences have accumulated, and new knowledge has been created in one, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: universe and sent back in time to the other, that we could receive knowledge, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that does not already exist in our universe., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: A more accurate way of thinking about the inter-universe ‘trade’ in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: knowledge is to think of all our knowledge-generating processes, our whole, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: culture and civilization, and all the thought processes in the minds of every, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: individual, and indeed the entire evolving biosphere as well, as being a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: gigantic computation. The whole thing is executing a self-motivated, self-, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: generating computer program. More specifically it is, as I have mentioned, a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: virtual-reality program in the process of rendering, with ever-increasing, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: accuracy, the whole of existence. In other universes there are other versions, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of this virtual-reality generator, some identical, some very different. If such a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: virtual-reality generator had access to a time machine, it would be able to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: receive some of the results of computations performed by its counterparts in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: other universes, in so far as the laws of physics allowed the requisite, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: interchange of information. Each piece of knowledge that one obtains from a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: time machine will have had an author somewhere in the multiverse, but it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: may benefit untold numbers of different universes. So a time machine is a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: computational resource that allows certain types of computation to be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: performed with enormously greater efficiency than they could be on any, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: individual computer. It achieves this efficiency by effectively sharing, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: computational work among copies of itself in different universes., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: In the absence of time machines, there tends to be very little interchange of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: information between universes because the laws of physics predict, in that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: case, very little causal contact between them. To a good degree of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: approximation, knowledge created in one set of identical snapshots reaches, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: relatively few other snapshots, namely those that are stacked into, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: spacetimes to the future of the original snapshots. But this is only an, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: approximation. Interference phenomena are the result of causal contact, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: between nearby universes. We have seen in Chapter 9 that even this, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: significant: quantum mechanics, with its parallel universes and the quantum, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: The fogies, hidebound by the comfortable orthodoxy of which they have, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: innovator’s ideas. This stereotype has been elevated into a philosophy by, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Thomas Kuhn, author of the influential book The Structure of Scientific, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Revolutions. According to Kuhn, the scientific establishment is defined by its, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: members’ belief in the set of prevailing theories, which together form a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: world-view, or paradigm. A paradigm is the psychological and theoretical, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: apparatus through which its holders observe and explain everything in their, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: experience. (Within any reasonably self-contained area of knowledge, such, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: as physics, one may also speak of the ‘paradigm’ within that field.) Should, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: any observation seem to violate the relevant paradigm, its holders are simply, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: blind to the violation. When confronted with evidence of it, they are obliged, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to regard it as an ‘anomaly’, an experimental error, a fraud — anything at all, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that will allow them to hold the paradigm inviolate. Thus Kuhn believes that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the scientific values of openness to criticism and tentativeness in accepting, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theories, and the scientific methods of experimental testing and the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: abandonment of prevailing theories when they are refuted, are largely myths, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that it would not be humanly possible to enact when dealing with any, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: significant scientific issue., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Kuhn accepts that, for insignificant scientific issues, something like a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: scientific process (as I outlined in Chapter 3) does happen. For he believes, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that science proceeds in alternating eras: there is ‘normal science’ and there, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: is ‘revolutionary science’. During an era of normal science nearly all, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: scientists believe in the prevailing fundamental theories, and try hard to fit all, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: their observations and subsidiary theories into that paradigm. Their research, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: consists of tying up loose ends, of improving the practical applications of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theories, of classifying, reformulating and confirming. Where applicable, they, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: may well use methods that are scientific in the Popperian sense, but they, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: never discover anything fundamental because they never question anything, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: fundamental. Then along come a few young troublemakers who deny some, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: fundamental tenet of the existing paradigm. This is not really scientific, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: criticism, for the troublemakers are not amenable to reason either. It is just, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that they view the world through a new and different paradigm. How did they, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: come by this paradigm? The pressure of accumulated evidence, and the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: inelegance of explaining it away under the old paradigm, finally got through, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to them. (Fair enough, though it is hard to see how one could succumb to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: pressure in the form of evidence to which one is, by hypothesis, blind.), Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Anyway, an era of ‘revolutionary’ science begins. The majority, who are still, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: trying to do ‘normal’ science in the old paradigm, fight back by fair means, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and foul — interfering with publication, excluding the heretics from academic, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: posts, and so on. The heretics manage to find ways of publishing, they, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ridicule the old fogies and they try to infiltrate influential institutions. The, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explanatory power of the new paradigm, in its own terms (for in terms of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: old paradigm its explanations seem extravagant and unconvincing), attracts, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: recruits from the ranks of uncommitted young scientists. There may also be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: defectors in both directions. Some of the old fogies die. Eventually one side, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: or the other wins. If the heretics win, they become the new scientific, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: establishment, and they defend their new paradigm just as blindly as the old, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: establishment defended theirs; if they lose, they become a footnote in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: scientific history. In either case, ‘normal’ science then resumes., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: This Kuhnian view of the scientific process seems natural to many people. It, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: appears to explain the repeated, jarring changes that science has been, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: forcing upon modern thought, in terms of everyday human attributes and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: impulses with which we are all familiar: entrenched prejudices and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: preconceptions, blindness to any evidence that one is mistaken, the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: suppression of dissent by vested interests, the desire for a quiet life, and so, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: on. And in opposition there is the rebelliousness of youth, the quest for, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: novelty, the joy of violating taboos and the struggle for power. Another, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: attraction of Kuhn’s ideas is that he cuts scientists down to size. No longer, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: can they claim to be noble seekers after truth who use the rational methods, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of conjecture, criticism and experimental testing to solve problems and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: create ever better explanations of the world. Kuhn reveals that they are just, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: rival teams playing endless games for the control of territory., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: The idea of a paradigm itself is unexceptionable. We do observe and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: understand the world through a collection of theories, and that constitutes a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: paradigm. But Kuhn is mistaken in thinking that holding a paradigm blinds, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: one to the merits of another paradigm, or prevents one from switching, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: paradigms, or indeed prevents one from comprehending two paradigms at, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the same time. (For a discussion of the broader implications of this error, see, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Popper’s The Myth of the Framework.) Admittedly, there is always a danger, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that we may underestimate or entirely miss the explanatory power of a new,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: It is also true that people, scientists included, and especially those in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: positions of power, do tend to become attached to the prevailing way of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: doing things, and can be suspicious of new ideas when they are quite, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: comfortable with the old ones. No one could claim that all scientists are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: uniformly and scrupulously rational in their judgement of ideas. Unjustified, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: loyalty to paradigms is indeed a frequent cause of controversy in science, as, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: it is elsewhere. But considered as a description or analysis of the scientific, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: process, Kuhn’s theory suffers from a fatal flaw. It explains the succession, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: from one paradigm to another in sociological or psychological terms, rather, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: than as having primarily to do with the objective merit of the rival, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explanations. Yet unless one understands science as a quest for, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explanations, the fact that it does find successive explanations, each, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: objectively better than the last, is inexplicable., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Hence Kuhn is forced flatly to deny that there has been objective, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: improvement in successive scientific explanations, or that such improvement, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: is possible, even in principle:, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:   , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: there is [a step] which many philosophers of science wish to take and which I, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: refuse. They wish, that is, to compare theories as representations of nature,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: as statements about ‘what is really out there’. Granted that neither theory of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: a historical pair is true, they nonetheless seek a sense in which the later is a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: better approximation to the truth. I believe that nothing of the sort can be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: found. (in Lakatos and Musgrave (eds), Criticism and the Growth of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Knowledge, p. 265), Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: So the growth of objective scientific knowledge cannot be explained in the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Kuhnian picture. It is no good trying to pretend that successive explanations, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: are better only in terms of their own paradigm. There are objective, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: differences. We can fly, whereas for most of human history people could, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: only dream of this. The ancients would not have been blind to the efficacy of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: our flying machines just because, within their paradigm, they could not, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: conceive of how they work. The reason why we can fly is that we understand, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘what is really out there’ well enough to build flying machines. The reason, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: why the ancients could not is that their understanding was objectively inferior, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to ours., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: If one does graft the reality of objective scientific progress onto Kuhn’s, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theory, it then implies that the entire burden of fundamental innovation is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: carried by a handful of iconoclastic geniuses. The rest of the scientific, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: community have their uses, but in significant matters they only hinder the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: growth of knowledge. This romantic view (which is often advanced, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: independently of Kuhnian ideas) does not correspond with reality either., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: There have indeed been geniuses who have single-handedly revolutionized, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: entire sciences; several have been mentioned in this book — Galileo,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Newton, Faraday, Darwin, Einstein, Gödel, Turing. But on the whole, these, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: people managed to work, publish and gain recognition despite the inevitable, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: opposition of stick-in-the-muds and time-servers. (Galileo was brought down,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: but not by rival scientists.) And though most of them did encounter irrational, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: opposition, none of their careers followed the iconoclast-versus-scientific-, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: establishment stereotype. Most of them derived benefit and support from, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: their interactions with scientists of the previous paradigm., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: I have sometimes found myself on the minority side of fundamental scientific, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: controversies. But I have never come across anything like a Kuhnian, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: situation. Of course, as I have said, the majority of the scientific community, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: is not always quite as open to criticism as it ideally should be. Nevertheless,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the extent to which it adheres to ‘proper scientific practice’ in the conduct of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: scientific research is nothing short of remarkable. You need only attend a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: research seminar in any fundamental field in the ‘hard’ sciences to see how, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: strongly people’s behaviour as researchers differs from human behaviour in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: general. Here we see a learned professor, acknowledged as the leading, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: expert in the entire field, delivering a seminar. The seminar room is filled with, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: people from every rank in the hierarchy of academic research, from graduate, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: students who were introduced to the field only weeks ago, to other, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: professors whose prestige rivals that of the speaker. The academic, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: hierarchy is an intricate power structure in which people’s careers, influence, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and reputation are continuously at stake, as much as in any cabinet room or, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: boardroom — or more so. Yet so long as the seminar is in progress it may, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: be quite hard for an observer to distinguish the participants’ ranks. The most, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: junior graduate student asks a question: ‘Does your third equation really, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: follow from the second one? Surely that term you omitted is not negligible.’, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: The professor is sure that the term is negligible, and that the student is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: making an error of judgement that someone more experienced would not, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: have made. So what happens next?, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: In an analogous situation, a powerful chief executive whose business, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: judgement was being contradicted by a brash new recruit might say, ‘Look,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: I’ve made more of these judgements than you’ve had hot dinners. If I tell you, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: it works, then it works.’ A senior politician might say in response to criticism, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: from an obscure but ambitious party worker, ‘Whose side are you on,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: anyway?’ Even our professor, away from the research context (while, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: delivering an undergraduate lecture, say) might well reply dismissively,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘You’d better learn to walk before you can run. Read the textbook, and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: meanwhile don’t waste your time and ours.’ But in the research seminar any, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: such response to criticism would cause a wave of embarrassment to pass, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: through the seminar room. People would avert their eyes and pretend to be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: diligently studying their notes. There would be smirks and sidelong glances., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Everyone would be shocked by the sheer impropriety of such an attitude. In, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: this situation, appeals to authority (at least, overt ones) are simply not, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: acceptable, even when the most senior person in the entire field is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: addressing the most junior., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: So the professor takes the student’s point seriously, and responds with a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: concise but adequate argument in defence of the disputed equation. The, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: professor tries hard to show no sign of being irritated by criticism from so, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: lowly a source. Most of the questions from the floor will have the form of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: criticisms which, if valid, would diminish or destroy the value of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: professor’s life’s work. But bringing vigorous and diverse criticism to bear on, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: accepted truths is one of the very purposes of the seminar. Everyone takes it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: for granted that the truth is not obvious, and that the obvious need not be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: true; that ideas are to be accepted or rejected according to their content and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: not their origin; that the greatest minds can easily make mistakes; and that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the most trivial-seeming objection may be the key to a great new discovery., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: So the participants in the seminar, while they are engaged in science, do, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: behave in large measure with scientific rationality. But now the seminar, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ends. Let us follow the group into the dining-hall. Immediately, normal, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: human social behaviour reasserts itself. The professor is treated with, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: deference, and sits at a table with those of equal rank. A chosen few from, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the lower ranks are given the privilege of being allowed to sit there too. The, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: conversation turns to the weather, gossip or (especially) academic politics., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: So long as those subjects are being discussed, all the dogmatism and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: prejudice, the pride and loyalty, the threats and flattery of typical human, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: interactions in similar circumstances will reappear. But if the conversation, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: happens to revert to the subject of the seminar, the scientists instantly, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: become scientists again. Explanations are sought, evidence and argument, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: rule, and rank becomes irrelevant to the course of the argument. That is, at, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: any rate, my experience in the fields in which I have worked., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Even though the history of quantum theory provides many examples of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: scientists clinging irrationally to what could be called ‘paradigms’, it would be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: hard to find a more spectacular counterexample to Kuhn’s theory of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: paradigm succession. The discovery of quantum theory was undoubtedly a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: conceptual revolution, perhaps the greatest since Galileo, and there were, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: indeed some ‘old fogies’ who never accepted it. But the major figures in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: physics, including almost all those who could be considered part of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: physics establishment, were immediately ready to drop the classical, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: paradigm. It rapidly became common ground that the new theory required a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: radical departure from the classical conception of the fabric of reality. The, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: only debate was about what the new conception must be. After a while, a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: new orthodoxy was established by the physicist Niels Bohr and his, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘Copenhagen school’. This new orthodoxy was never accepted widely, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: enough as a description of reality for it to be called a paradigm, though, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: overtly it was endorsed by most physicists (Einstein was a notable, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: exception). Remarkably, it was not centred on the proposition that the new, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: quantum theory was true. On the contrary, it depended crucially on quantum, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theory, at least in its current form, being false! According to the ‘Copenhagen, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: interpretation’, the equations of quantum theory apply only to unobserved, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: aspects of physical reality. At moments of observation a different type of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: process takes over, involving a direct interaction between human, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: consciousness and subatomic physics. One particular state of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: consciousness becomes real, the rest were only possibilities. The, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Copenhagen interpretation specified this alleged process only in outline; a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: fuller description was deemed to be a task for the future, or perhaps, to be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: forever beyond human comprehension. As for the unobserved events that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: interpolated between conscious observations, one was ‘not permitted to ask’, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: about them! How physicists, even during what was the heyday of positivism, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and instrumentalism, could accept such an insubstantial construction as the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: orthodox version of a fundamental theory is a question for historians. We, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: need not concern ourselves here with the arcane details of the Copenhagen, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: interpretation, because its motivation was essentially to avoid the conclusion, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that reality is multi-valued, and for that reason alone it is incompatible with, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: any genuine explanation of quantum phenomena., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Some twenty years later, Hugh Everett, then a Princeton graduate student, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: working under the eminent physicist John Archibald Wheeler, first set out the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: many-universes implications of quantum theory. Wheeler did not accept, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: them. He was (and still is) convinced that Bohr’s vision, though incomplete,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: was the basis of the correct explanation. But did he therefore behave as the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Kuhnian stereotype would lead us to expect? Did he try to suppress his, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: student’s heretical ideas? On the contrary, Wheeler was afraid that Everett’s, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ideas might not be sufficiently appreciated. So he himself wrote a short, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: paper to accompany the one that Everett published, and they appeared on, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: consecutive pages of the journal Reviews of Modern Physics. Wheeler’s, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: paper explained and defended Everett’s so effectively that many readers, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: assumed that they were jointly responsible for the content. Consequently the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: multiverse theory was mistakenly known as the ‘Everett-Wheeler theory’ for, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: many years afterwards, much to Wheeler’s chagrin., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Wheeler’s exemplary adherence to scientific rationality may be extreme, but, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: it is by no means unique. In this regard I must mention Bryce DeWitt,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: another eminent physicist who initially opposed Everett. In a historic, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: exchange of letters, DeWitt put forward a series of detailed technical, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: objections to Everett’s theory, each of which Everett rebutted. DeWitt ended, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: his argument on an informal note, pointing out that he just couldn’t feel, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: himself ‘split’ into multiple, distinct copies every time a decision was made., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Everett’s reply echoed the dispute between Galileo and the Inquisition. ‘Do, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: you feel the Earth move?’ he asked — the point being that quantum theory, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: explains why one does not feel such splits, just as Galileo’s theory of inertia, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explains why one does not feel the Earth move. DeWitt conceded., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Nevertheless, Everett’s discovery did not gain broad acceptance., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Unfortunately, in the generation between the Copenhagen interpretation and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Everett most physicists had given up on the idea of explanation in quantum, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theory. As I said, it was the heyday of positivism in the philosophy of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: science. Rejection (or incomprehension) of the Copenhagen interpretation,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: coupled with what might be called pragmatic instrumentalism, became (and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: remains) the typical physicist’s attitude to the deepest known theory of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: reality. If instrumentalism is the doctrine that explanations are pointless, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: because a theory is only an ‘instrument’ for making predictions, pragmatic, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: instrumentalism is the practice of using scientific theories without knowing or, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: caring what they mean. In this respect, Kuhnian pessimism about scientific, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: rationality was borne out. But the Kuhnian story of how new paradigms, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: replace old ones was not borne out at all. In a sense, pragmatic, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: instrumentalism itself became a ‘paradigm’ which physicists adopted to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: replace the classical idea of an objective reality. But this is not the sort of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: paradigm that one understands the world through! In any case, whatever, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: else physicists were doing they were not viewing the world through the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: paradigm of classical physics — the epitome, among other things, of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: objective realism and determinism. Most of them dropped it almost as soon, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: as quantum theory was proposed, even though it had held sway over the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: whole of science, unchallenged ever since Galileo won the intellectual, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: argument against the Inquisition a third of a millennium earlier., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Pragmatic instrumentalism has been feasible only because, in most, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: branches of physics, quantum theory is not applied in its explanatory, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: capacity. It is used only indirectly, in the testing of other theories, and only its, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: predictions are needed. Thus generations of physicists have found it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: sufficient to regard interference processes, such as those that take place for, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: a thousand-trillionth of a second when two elementary particles collide, as a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘black box’: they prepare an input, and they observe an output. They use the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: equations of quantum theory to predict the one from the other, but they, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: neither know nor care how the output comes about as a result of the input., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: However, there are two branches of physics where this attitude is impossible, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: because the internal workings of the quantum-mechanical object constitute, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the entire subject-matter of that branch. Those branches are the quantum, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theory of computation, and quantum cosmology (the quantum theory of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: physical reality as a whole). After all, it would be a poor ‘theory of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: computation’ that never addressed issues of how the output is obtained from, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the input! And as for quantum cosmology, we can neither prepare an input at, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the beginning of the multiverse nor measure an output at the end. Its internal, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: workings are all there is. For this reason, quantum theory is used in its full,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: multiverse form by the overwhelming majority of researchers in these two, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: fields., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: So Everett’s story is indeed that of an innovative young, researcher, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: challenging a prevailing consensus and being largely ignored until, decades, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: later, his view gradually becomes the new consensus. But the basis of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Everett’s innovation was not a claim that the prevailing theory is false, but, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that it is true! The incumbents, far from being able to think only in terms of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: their own theory, were refusing to think in its terms, and were using it only, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: instrumentally. Yet they had dropped the previous explanatory paradigm,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: classical physics, with scarcely a complaint as soon as a better theory was, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: available., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Something of the same strange phenomenon has also occurred in the other, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: three theories that provide the main strands of explanation of the fabric of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: reality: the theories of computation, evolution and knowledge. In all cases, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the theory that now prevails, though it has definitely displaced its, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: predecessor and other rivals in the sense that it is being applied routinely in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: pragmatic ways, has nevertheless failed to become the new ‘paradigm’. That, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: is, it has not been taken on board as a fundamental explanation of reality by, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: those who work in the field., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: The Turing principle, for instance, has hardly ever been seriously doubted as, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: a pragmatic truth, at least in its weak forms (for example, that a universal, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: computer could render any physically possible environment). Roger, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Penrose’s criticisms are a rare exception, for he understands that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: contradicting the Turing principle involves contemplating radically new, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theories in both physics and epistemology, and some interesting new, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: assumptions about biology too. Neither Penrose nor anyone else has yet, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: actually proposed any viable rival to the Turing principle, so it remains the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: prevailing fundamental theory of computation. Yet the proposition that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: artificial intelligence is possible in principle, which follows by simple logic, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: from this prevailing theory, is by no means taken for granted. (An artificial, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: intelligence is a computer program that possesses properties of the human, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mind including intelligence, consciousness, free will and emotions, but runs, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: on hardware other than the human brain.) The possibility of artificial, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: intelligence is bitterly contested by eminent philosophers (including, alas,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Popper), scientists and mathematicians, and by at least one prominent, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: computer scientist. But few of these opponents seem to understand that they, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: are contradicting the acknowledged fundamental principle of a fundamental, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: discipline. They contemplate no alternative foundations for the discipline, as, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Penrose does. It is as if they were denying the possibility that we could travel, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to Mars, without noticing that our best theories of engineering and physics, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: say that we can. Thus they violate a basic tenet of rationality — that good, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explanations are not to be discarded lightly., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: But it is not only the opponents of artificial intelligence who have failed to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: incorporate the Turing principle into their paradigm. Very few others have, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: done so either. The fact that four decades passed after the principle was, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: proposed before anyone investigated its implications for physics, and a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: further decade passed before quantum computation was discovered, bears, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: witness to this. People were accepting and using the principle pragmatically, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: within computer science, but it was not integrated with their overall world-, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: view., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Popper’s epistemology has, in every pragmatic sense, become the prevailing, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: theories from observations, but proceed by explanatory conjectures and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: much disagreement with Popper’s description and prescription of scientific, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: method, or believe that scientific theories are actually unsound because of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: their conjectural status. It is that they do not accept Popper’s explanation of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: view is that there is a fundamental philosophical problem with the Popperian, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: Darwin’s theory of evolution is also the prevailing theory in its field, in the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: sense that no one seriously doubts that evolution through natural selection,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: acting on populations with random variations, is the ‘origin of species’ and of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: biological adaptation in general. No serious biologist or philosopher, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: attributes the origin of species to divine creation or to Lamarckian evolution., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: (Lamarckism, an evolutionary theory that Darwinism superseded, was the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: analogue of inductivism. It attributed biological adaptations to the inheritance, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of characteristics that the organism had striven for and acquired during its, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: life.) Yet, just as with the other three strands, objections to pure Darwinism, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: as an explanation of the phenomena of the biosphere are numerous and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: widespread. One class of objections centres on the question whether in the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: history of the biosphere there has been enough time for such colossal, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: complexity to have evolved by natural selection alone. No viable rival theory, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: has been advanced to substantiate such objections, except conceivably the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: idea, of which the astronomers Fred Hoyle and Chandra Wickramasinghe, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: are recent proponents, that the complex molecules on which life is based, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: originated in outer space. But the point of such objections is not so much to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: contradict the Darwinian model as to claim that something fundamental, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: remains unexplained in the matter of how the adaptations we observe in the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: biosphere came into being., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Darwinism has also been criticized as being circular because it invokes ‘the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: survival of the fittest’ as an explanation, while the ‘fittest’ are defined, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: retrospectively, by their having survived. Alternatively, in terms of an, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: independent definition of ‘fitness’, the idea that evolution ‘favours the fittest’, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: seems to be contradicted by the facts. For example, the most intuitive, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: definition of biological fitness would be ‘fitness of a species for survival in a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: particular niche’, in the sense that a tiger might be thought to be the optimal, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: machine for occupying the ecological niche that tigers occupy. The standard, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: counter-examples to that sort of ‘survival of the fittest’ are adaptations, such, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: as the peacock’s tail, that seem to make the organism much less fit to exploit, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: its niche. Such objections seem to undermine the ability of Darwin’s theory to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: meet its original purpose, which was to explain how the apparent ‘design’, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: (i.e. adaptations) in living organisms could have come into being through the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: Richard Dawkins’ innovation, as set out in his books The Selfish Gene and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: The Blind Watchmaker, is yet again the claim that the prevailing theory is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: true after all. He argues that none of the current objections to the unadorned, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Darwinian model turn out, on careful inspection, to have any substance. In, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: other words, Dawkins claims that Darwin’s theory of evolution does provide a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: full explanation of the origin of biological adaptations. Dawkins elaborated, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Darwin’s theory in its modern form as the theory of replicators. The replicator, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that is best at getting itself replicated in a given environment will eventually, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: displace all variants of itself because, by definition, they are worse at getting, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: themselves replicated. It is not the fittest species variant that survives, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: (Darwin had hot quite realized this) but the fittest gene variant. One, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: consequence of this is that sometimes a gene may displace variant genes, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: (such as genes for less cumbersome tails in peacocks) by means (such as, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: sexual selection) that do not especially promote the good of the species or, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the individual. But all evolution promotes the ‘good’ (i.e. the replication) of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the best-replicating genes — hence the term ‘selfish gene’. Dawkins meets, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: each of the objections in detail and shows that Darwin’s theory, correctly, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: interpreted, has none of the alleged flaws and does indeed explain the origin, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of adaptations., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: It is specifically Dawkins’ version of Darwinism that has become the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: prevailing theory of evolution in the pragmatic sense. Yet it is still by no, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: means the prevailing paradigm. Many biologists and philosophers are still, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: haunted by the feeling that there is some fundamental gap in the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explanation. For example, in the same sense that Kuhn’s theory of ‘scientific, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: revolutions’ challenges the Popperian picture of science, there is a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: corresponding evolutionary theory which challenges Dawkins’ picture of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: evolution. This is the theory of punctuated equilibrium, which says that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: evolution happens in short bursts, with long periods of unselected change in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: between. This theory may even be factually true. It does not actually, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: contradict the ‘selfish gene’ theory, any more than Popperian epistemology, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: is contradicted by the proposition that conceptual revolutions do not happen, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: every day, or that scientists often resist fundamental innovation. But just as, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: with Kuhn’s theory, the way in which punctuated equilibrium and other, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: variant evolutionary scenarios have been presented, as solving some, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: allegedly overlooked problem in the prevailing evolutionary theory, reveals, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the extent to which the explanatory power of Dawkins’ theory has yet to be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: assimilated., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: There has been a very unfortunate consequence, for all four strands, of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: prevailing theory’s being generally rejected as an explanation, without, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: serious rival explanations being current. It is that the proponents of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: prevailing theories — Popper, Turing, Everett, Dawkins and their supporters, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: — have found themselves constantly on the defensive against obsolete, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theories. The debate between Popper and most of his critics was (as I said, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: in Chapters 3 and 7) effectively about the problem of induction. Turing spent, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the last years of his life in effect defending the proposition that human brains, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: do not operate by supernatural means. Everett left scientific research after, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: making no headway, and for several years the theory of the multiverse was, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: championed almost single-handedly by Bryce DeWitt until progress in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: quantum cosmology in the 1970s forced its pragmatic acceptance in that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: field. But the opponents of the multiverse theory as an explanation have, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: seldom advanced rival explanations. (David Bohm’s theory, which I, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mentioned in Chapter 4, is an exception.) Instead, as the cosmologist, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Dennis Sciama once remarked, ‘When it comes to the interpretation of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: quantum mechanics, the standard of argument suddenly drops to zero.’, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Proponents of the multiverse theory typically face a wistful, defiant but, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: incoherent appeal to the Copenhagen interpretation — which, however,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: hardly anyone still believes. And finally, Dawkins has somehow become the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: public defender of scientific rationality against, of all things, creationism, and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: more generally against a pre-scientific world-view that has been obsolete, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: since Galileo. The frustrating thing about all this is that, so long as the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: proponents of our best theories of the fabric of reality have to expend their, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: intellectual energies in futile refutation and re-refutation of theories long, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: known to be false, the state of our deepest knowledge cannot improve., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Either Turing or Everett could easily have discovered the quantum theory of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: computation. Popper could have been elaborating the theory of scientific, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explanation. (In fairness I must acknowledge that he did understand and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: elaborate some connections between his epistemology and the theory of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: evolution.) Dawkins could, for instance, be advancing his own theory of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: evolution of replicating ideas (memes)., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: The unified theory of the fabric of reality that is the subject of this book is, at, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the most straightforward level, merely the combination of the four prevailing, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: fundamental theories of their respective fields. In that sense it too is the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘prevailing theory’ of those four fields taken as a whole. Even some of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: connections between the four strands are quite widely acknowledged. My, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: thesis, therefore, also takes the form ‘the prevailing theory is true after all!’, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Not only do I advocate taking each of the fundamental theories seriously as, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: an explanation of its own subject-matter, I argue that taken together they, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: provide a new level of explanation of a unified fabric of reality., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: I have also argued that none of the four strands can be properly understood, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: independently of the other three. This is possibly a clue to the reason why all, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: these prevailing theories have not been believed. All four individual, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explanations share an unattractive property which has been variously, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: criticized as ‘idealized and unrealistic’, ‘narrow’ or ‘naïve’ — and also ‘cold’,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘mechanistic’ and ‘lacking in humanity’. I believe that there is some truth in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the gut feeling behind these criticisms. For example, of those who deny the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: possibility of artificial intelligence, and find themselves in effect denying that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the brain is a physical object, a few are really only trying to express a much, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: more reasonable criticism: that the Turing explanation of computation seems, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to leave no room, even in principle, for any future explanation in physical, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: terms of mental attributes such as consciousness and free will. It is then not, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: good enough for artificial-intelligence enthusiasts to respond brusquely that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: the Turing principle guarantees that a computer can do everything a brain, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: can do. That is of course true, but it is an answer in terms of prediction, and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the problem is one of explanation. There is an explanatory gap., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: I do not believe that this gap can be filled without bringing in the other three, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: strands. Now, as I have said, my guess is that the brain is a classical, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: computer and not a quantum computer, so I do not expect the explanation of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: consciousness to be that it is any sort of quantum-computational, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: phenomenon. Nevertheless, I expect the unification of computation and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: quantum physics, and probably the wider unification of all four strands, to be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: essential to the fundamental philosophical advances from which an, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: understanding of consciousness will one day flow. Lest the reader find this, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: paradoxical, let me draw an analogy with a similar problem from an earlier, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: era, ‘What is life?’ This problem was solved by Darwin. The essence of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: solution was the idea that the intricate and apparently purposeful design that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: is apparent in living organisms is not built into reality ab initio, but is an, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: emergent consequence of the operation of the laws of physics. The laws of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: physics had not specifically mandated the shapes of elephants and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: peacocks, any more than a Creator had. They make no reference to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: outcomes, especially emergent ones; they merely determine the rules under, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: which atoms and the like interact. Now, this conception of a law of nature as, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: a set of laws of motion is relatively recent. It can, I think, be credited, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: specifically to Galileo, and to some extent to Newton. The previous concept, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of a law of nature had been that of a rule stating what happens. An example, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: is Johannes Kepler’s laws of planetary motion, which described how the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: planets move in elliptical orbits. This is to be contrasted with Newton’s laws,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: which are laws of physics in the modern sense. They make no mention of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ellipses, though they reproduce (and correct) Kepler’s predictions under, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: appropriate conditions. No one could have explained what life is under, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Kepler’s conception of a ‘law of physics’, for they would have been looking, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: for a law that mandates elephants in the same way as Kepler’s laws, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mandate ellipses. But Darwin was able to wonder how laws of nature that did, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: not mention elephants could nevertheless produce them, just as Newton’s, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: laws produce ellipses. Although Darwin made no use of any specific law of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Newton’s, his discovery would have been inconceivable without the world-, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: view underlying those laws. That is the sense in which I expect the solution, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of the ‘What is consciousness?’ problem to depend on quantum theory. It will, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: invoke no specific quantum-mechanical processes, but it will depend, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: crucially on the quantum-mechanical, and especially the multi-universe,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: world-picture., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: What is my evidence? I have already presented some of it in Chapter 8,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: where I discussed the multiverse view of knowledge. Although we do not, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: know what consciousness is, it is clearly intimately related to the growth and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: representation of knowledge within the brain. It seems unlikely, then, that we, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: shall be able to explain what consciousness is, as a physical process, before, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: we have explained knowledge in physical terms. Such an explanation has, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: been elusive in the classical theory of computation. But, as I explained, in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: quantum theory there is a good basis for one: knowledge can be understood, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: as complexity that extends across large numbers of universes., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Another mental attribute that is somehow associated with consciousness is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: free will. Free will is also notoriously difficult to understand in the classical, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: world-picture. The difficulty of reconciling free will with physics is often, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: attributed to determinism, but it is not determinism that is at fault. It is (as I, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: have explained in Chapter 11) classical spacetime. In spacetime, something, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: happens to me at each particular moment in my future. Even if what will, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: happen is unpredictable, it is already there, on the appropriate cross-section, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of spacetime. It makes no sense to speak of my ‘changing’ what is on that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: cross-section. Spacetime does not change, therefore one cannot, within, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: spacetime physics, conceive of causes, effects, the openness of the future, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: or free will., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Thus, replacing deterministic laws of motion by indeterministic (random), Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ones would do nothing to solve the problem of free will, so long as the laws, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: remained classical. Freedom has nothing to do with randomness. We value, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: our free will as the ability to express, in our actions, who we as individuals, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: are. Who would value being random? What we think of as our free actions, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: are not those that are random or undetermined but those that are largely, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: determined by who we are, and what we think, and what is at issue., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: (Although they are largely determined, they may be highly unpredictable in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: practice for reasons of complexity.), Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Consider this typical statement referring to free will: ‘After careful thought I, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: chose to do X; I could have chosen otherwise; it was the right decision; I am, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: good at making such decisions.’ In any classical world-picture this statement, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: is pure gibberish. In the multiverse picture it has a straightforward physical, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: representation, shown in Table 13.1. (I am not proposing to define moral or, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: aesthetic values in terms of such representations; I am merely pointing out, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that, thanks to the multiverse character of quantum reality, free will and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: related concepts are now compatible with physics.), Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Thus Turing’s conception of computation seems less disconnected from, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: human values, and is no obstacle to the understanding of human attributes, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: like free will, provided it is understood in a multiverse context. The same, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: example exonerates Everett’s theory itself. On the face of it, the price of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: understanding interference phenomena is to create or exacerbate many, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: philosophical problems. But here, and in many other examples I have given, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: in this book, we see that the very opposite is the case. The fruitfulness of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: multiverse theory in contributing to the solution of long-standing, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: philosophical problems is so great that it would be worth adopting even if, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: there were no physical evidence for it at all. Indeed, the philosopher David, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: to those who criticize Darwinian evolution on the grounds that it seems, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘unlikely’ that such complex adaptations could have evolved in the given, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: we would be if a heap of spare parts thrown together happened to fall into, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the pattern of a Boeing 747. On the face of it, this critic is forcing an analogy, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: between, on the one hand, billions of years of planet-wide trial and error, and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: on the other hand an instantaneous accident of ‘happening to fall together’., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: That would be wilfully to miss the whole point of the evolutionary, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: completely adequate as an explanation? Dawkins wants us not to be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: surprised that complex adaptations have come into being spontaneously. In, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: other words, he is claiming that his ‘selfish gene’ theory is a full explanation, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: complex adaptations to come into being., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: But it is not a full explanation. There is an explanatory gap, and this time we, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: An analogous gap exists in Popperian epistemology. Its critics wonder why, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the scientific method works, or what justifies our reliance on the best, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: scientific theories. This leads them to hanker after a principle of induction or, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: something of the sort (though, as crypto-inductivists, they usually realize that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: such a principle would not explain or justify anything either). For Popperians, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to reply that there is no such thing as justification, or that it is never rational, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to rely on theories, is to provide no explanation. Popper even said that ‘no, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: theory of knowledge should attempt to explain why we are successful in our, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: attempts to explain things’ (Objective Knowledge p. 23). But, once we, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: understand that the growth of human knowledge is a physical process, we, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: see that it cannot be illegitimate to try to explain how and why it occurs., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Epistemology is a theory of (emergent) physics. It is a factual theory about, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the circumstances under which a certain physical quantity (knowledge) will, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: or will not grow. The bare assertions of this theory are largely accepted. But, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: we cannot possibly find an explanation of why they are true solely within the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theory of knowledge per se. In that narrow sense, Popper was right. The, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explanation must involve quantum physics, the Turing principle and, as, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: The proponents of the prevailing theory, in each of the four cases, are put, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: permanently on the defensive by their critics’ harping on these explanatory, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: gaps. This often forces them to retreat into the core of their own strand., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘Here I stand, I can do no other’ is their ultimate response, as they rely on, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the self-evident irrationality of abandoning the unrivalled fundamental theory, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of their own particular field. This only makes them seem even more narrow, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Despite all the excuses I have been making for the critics of the central, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theories, the history of all four strands shows that something very unpleasant, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: happened to fundamental science and philosophy for most of the twentieth, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: century. The popularity of positivism and of an instrumentalist view of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: science was connected with an apathy, loss of self-confidence and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: pessimism about genuine explanations at a time when the prestige,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: usefulness and, indeed, funding for fundamental research were all at an all-, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: time high. Of course there were many individual exceptions, including the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: four heroes of this chapter. But the unprecedented manner in which their, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theories were simultaneously adopted and ignored speaks for itself. I do not, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: claim to have a full explanation for this phenomenon, but whatever caused it,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: we seem to be coming out of it now., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: all four theories have explanatory gaps that can make them seem narrow,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: inhuman and pessimistic. But I suggest that when they are taken together as, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: a unified explanation of the fabric of reality, this unfortunate property is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: reversed. Far from denying free will, far from placing human values in a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: context where they are trivial and insignificant, far from being pessimistic, it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: is a fundamentally optimistic world-view that places human minds at the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: centre of the physical universe, and explanation and understanding at the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text:   , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: The intellectual histories of the fundamental theories of the four strands, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: contain remarkable parallels. All four have been simultaneously accepted, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: (for use in practice) and ignored (as explanations of reality). One reason for, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: this is that, taken individually, each of the four theories has explanatory, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: gaps, and seems cold and pessimistic. To base a world-view on any of them, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: individually is, in a generalized sense, reductionist. But when they are taken, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: together as a unified explanation of the fabric of reality, this is no longer so., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text:  When, in the course of my research on the foundations of quantum theory, I, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: was first becoming aware of the links between quantum physics,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: computation and epistemology, I regarded these links as evidence of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: historical tendency for physics to swallow up subjects that had previously, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: seemed unrelated to it. Astronomy, for example, was linked with terrestrial, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: physics by Newton’s laws, and over the next few centuries much of it was, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: absorbed and became astrophysics. Chemistry began to be subsumed into, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: physics by Faraday’s discoveries in electrochemistry, and quantum theory, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: has made a remarkable proportion of basic chemistry directly predictable, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: from the laws of physics alone. Einstein’s general relativity swallowed, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: geometry, and rescued both cosmology and the theory of time from their, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: former purely philosophical status, making them into fully integrated, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: branches of physics. Recently, as I have discussed, the theory of time travel, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: has been integrated as well., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Thus, the further prospect of quantum physics absorbing not only the theory, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of computation but also, of all things, proof theory (which has the alternative, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: name ‘meta-mathematics’) seemed to me to be evidence of two trends. First,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that human knowledge as a whole was continuing to take on the unified, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: structure that it would have to have if it was comprehensible in the strong, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: sense I hoped for. And second, that the unified structure itself was going to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: consist of an ever deepening and broadening theory of fundamental physics., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: The reader will know that I have changed my mind about the second point., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: The character of the fabric of reality that I am now proposing is not that of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: fundamental physics alone. For example, the quantum theory of computation, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: has not been constructed by deriving principles of computation from, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: quantum physics alone. It includes the Turing principle, which was already,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: under the name of the Church-Turing conjecture, the basis of the theory of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: computation. It had never been used in physics, but I have argued that it is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: only as a principle of physics that it can be properly understood. It is on a par, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: with the principle of the conservation of energy and the other laws of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: thermodynamics: that is, it is a constraint that, to the best of our knowledge,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: all other theories conform to. But, unlike existing laws of physics, it has an, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: emergent character, referring directly to the properties of complex machines, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and only consequentially to subatomic objects and processes. (Arguably, the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: second law of thermodynamics — the principle of increasing entropy — is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: also of that form.), Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Similarly, if we understand knowledge and adaptation as structure which, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: extends across large numbers of universes, then we expect the principles of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: epistemology and evolution to be expressible directly as laws about the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: structure of the multiverse. That is, they are physical laws, but at an, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: emergent level. Admittedly, quantum complexity theory has not yet reached, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the point where it can express, in physical terms, the proposition that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: knowledge can grow only in situations that conform to the Popperian pattern, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: shown in Figure 3.3. But that is just the sort of proposition that I expect to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: appear in the nascent Theory of Everything, the unified explanatory and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: predictive theory of all four strands., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: That being so, the view that quantum physics is swallowing the other strands, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: must be regarded merely as a narrow, physicist’s perspective, tainted,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: perhaps, by reductionism. Indeed, each of the other three strands is quite, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: rich enough to form the whole foundation of some people’s world-view in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: much the same way that fundamental physics forms the foundation of a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: reductionist’s world-view. Richard Dawkins thinks that ‘If superior creatures, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: from space ever visit Earth, the first question they will ask, in order to assess, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the level of our civilisation, is: “Have they discovered evolution yet?”’ Many, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: philosophers have agreed with Rene Descartes that epistemology underlies, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: all other knowledge, and that something like Descartes’s cogito ergo sum, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: argument is our most basic explanation. Many computer scientists have, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: been so impressed with recently discovered connections between physics, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and computation that they have concluded that the universe is a computer,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and the laws of physics are programs that run on it. But all these are narrow,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: even misleading perspectives on the true fabric of reality. Objectively, the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: new synthesis has a character of its own, substantially different from that of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: any of the four strands it unifies., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: For example, I have remarked that the fundamental theories of each of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: four strands have been criticized, in part justifiably, for being ‘naïve’,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘narrow’, ‘cold’, and so on. Thus, from the point of view of a reductionist, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: physicist such as Stephen Hawking, the human race is just an, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: astrophysically insignificant ‘chemical scum’. Steven Weinberg thinks that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘The more the universe seems comprehensible, the more it also seems, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: pointless. But if there is no solace in the fruits of our research, there is at, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: least some consolation in the research itself.’ (The First Three Minutes, p., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: 154.) But anyone not involved in fundamental physics must wonder why., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: As for computation, the computer scientist Tomasso Toffoli has remarked, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that ‘We never perform a computation ourselves, we just hitch a ride on the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: great Computation that is going on already.’ To him, this is no cry of despair, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: — quite the contrary. But critics of the computer-science world-view do not, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: want to see themselves as just someone else’s program running on, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: someone else’s computer. Narrowly conceived evolutionary theory considers, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: us mere ‘vehicles’ for the replication of our genes or memes; and it refuses, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to address the question of why evolution has tended to create ever greater, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: adaptive complexity, or the role that such complexity plays in the wider, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: scheme of things. Similarly, the (crypto-)inductivist critique of Popperian, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: epistemology is that, while it states the conditions for scientific knowledge to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: grow, it seems not to explain why it grows — why it creates theories that are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: worth using., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: As I have explained, the defence in each case depends on adducing, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explanations from some of the other strands. We are not merely ‘chemical, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: scum’, because (for instance) the gross behaviour of our planet, star and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: galaxy depend on an emergent but fundamental physical quantity: the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: knowledge in that scum. The creation of useful knowledge by science, and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: adaptations by evolution, must be understood as the emergence of the self-, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: similarity that is mandated by a principle of physics, the Turing principle. And, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: so on., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: Thus the problem with taking any of these fundamental theories individually, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: as the basis of a world-view is that they are each, in an extended sense,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: reductionist. That is, they have a monolithic explanatory structure in which, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: everything follows from a few extremely deep ideas. But that leaves aspects, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of the subject entirely unexplained. In contrast, the explanatory structure that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: they jointly provide for the fabric of reality is not hierarchical: each of the four, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: strands contains principles which are ‘emergent’ from the perspective of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: other three, but nevertheless help to explain them., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Three of the four strands seem to rule out human beings and human values, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: from the fundamental level of explanation. The fourth, epistemology, makes, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: knowledge primary but gives no reason to regard epistemology itself as, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: having relevance beyond the psychology of our own species. Knowledge, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: seems a parochial concept until we consider it from a multiverse perspective., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: But if knowledge is of fundamental significance, we may ask what sort of role, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: now seems natural for knowledge-creating beings such as ourselves in the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: unified fabric of reality. This question has been explored by the cosmologist, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Frank Tipler. His answer, the omega-point theory, is an excellent example of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: a theory which is, in the sense of this book, about the fabric of reality as a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: whole. It is not framed within any one strand, but belongs irreducibly to all, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: four. Unfortunately Tipler himself, in his book The Physics of Immortality,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: makes exaggerated claims for his theory which have caused most scientists, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and philosophers to reject it out of hand, thereby missing the valuable core, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: idea which I shall now explain., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: From my own perspective, the simplest point of entry to the omega-point, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theory is the Turing principle. A universal virtual-reality generator is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: physically possible. Such a machine is able to render any physically possible, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: environment, as well as certain hypothetical and abstract entities, to any, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: desired accuracy. Its computer therefore has a potentially unlimited, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: requirement for additional memory, and may run for an unlimited number of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: steps. This was trivial to arrange in the classical theory of computation, so, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: long as the universal computer was thought to be purely abstract. Turing, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: simply postulated an infinitely long memory tape (with, as he thought, self-, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: evident properties), a perfectly accurate processor requiring neither power, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: nor maintenance, and unlimited time available. Making the model more, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: realistic by allowing for periodic maintenance raises no problem of principle,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: but the other three requirements — unlimited memory capacity, and an, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: unlimited running time and energy supply — are problematic in the light of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: existing cosmological theory. In some current cosmological models, the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: universe will recollapse in a Big Crunch after a finite time, and is also, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: spatially finite. It has the geometry of a ‘3-sphere’, the three-dimensional, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: analogue of the two-dimensional surface of a sphere. On the face of it, such, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: a cosmology would place a finite bound on both the memory capacity and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the number of processing steps the machine could perform before the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: universe ended. This would make a universal computer physically, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: impossible, so the Turing principle would be violated. In other cosmological, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: models the universe continues to expand for ever and is spatially infinite,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: which might seem to allow for an unlimited source of material for the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: manufacture of additional memory. Unfortunately, in most such models the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: density of energy available to power the computer would diminish as the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: universe expanded, and would have to be collected from ever further afield., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: Because physics imposes an absolute speed limit, the speed of light, the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: computer’s memory accesses would have to slow down and the net effect, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: would again be that only a finite number of computational steps could be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: performed., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: The key discovery in the omega-point theory is that of a class of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: cosmological models in which, though the universe is finite in both space, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and time, the memory capacity, the number of possible computational steps, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and the effective energy supply are all unlimited. This apparent impossibility, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: can happen because of the extreme violence of the final moments of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: universe’s Big Crunch collapse. Spacetime singularities, like the Big Bang, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and the Big Crunch, are seldom tranquil places, but this one is far worse, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: than most. The shape of the universe would change from a 3-sphere to the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: three-dimensional analogue of the surface of an ellipsoid. The degree of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: deformation would increase, and then decrease, and then increase again, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: more rapidly with respect to a different axis. Both the amplitude and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: frequency of these oscillations would increase without limit as the final, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: singularity was approached, so that a literally infinite number of oscillations, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: would occur even though the end would come within a finite time. Matter as, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: we know it would not survive: all matter, and even the atoms themselves,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: would be wrenched apart by the gravitational shearing forces generated by, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the deformed spacetime. However, these shearing forces would also provide, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: an unlimited source of available energy, which could in principle be used to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: power a computer. How could a computer exist under such conditions? The, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: only ‘stuff’ left to build computers with would be elementary particles and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: gravity itself, presumably in some highly exotic quantum states whose, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: existence we, still lacking an adequate theory of quantum gravity, are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: currently unable to confirm or deny. (Observing them experimentally is of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: course out of the question.) If suitable states of particles and the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: gravitational field exist, then they would also provide an unlimited memory, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: capacity, and the universe would be shrinking so fast that an infinite number, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of memory accesses would be feasible in a finite time before the end. The, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: end-point of the gravitational collapse, the Big Crunch of this cosmology, is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: what Tipler calls the omega point., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Now, the Turing principle implies that there is no upper bound on the number, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of computational steps that are physically possible. So, given that an omega-, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: point cosmology is (under plausible assumptions) the only type in which an, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: infinite number of computational steps could occur, we can infer that our, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: actual spacetime must have the omega-point form. Since all computation, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: would cease as soon as there were no more variables capable of carrying, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: information, we can infer that the necessary physical variables (perhaps, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: quantum-gravitational ones) do exist right up to the omega point., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: A sceptic might argue that this sort of reasoning involves a massive,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: unjustified extrapolation. We have experience of ‘universal’ computers only, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: in a most favourable environment which does not remotely resemble the final, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: stages of the universe. And we have experience of them performing only a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: finite number of computational steps, using only a finite amount of memory., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: How can it be valid to extrapolate from those finite numbers to infinity? In, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: other words, how can we know that the Turing principle in its strong form is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: strictly true? What evidence is there that reality supports more than, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: approximate universality?, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: This sceptic is, of course, an inductivist. Furthermore, this is exactly the type, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of thinking that (as I argued in the previous chapter) prevents us from, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: understanding our best theories and improving upon them. What is or is not, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: an ‘extrapolation’ depends on which theory one starts with. If one starts with, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: some vague but parochial concept of what is ‘normal’ about the possibilities, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of computation, a concept uninformed by the best available explanations in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that subject, then one will regard any application of the theory outside, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: familiar circumstances as ‘unjustified extrapolation’. But if one starts with, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explanations from the best available fundamental theory, then one will, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: consider the very idea that some nebulous ‘normalcy’ holds in extreme, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: situations to be an unjustified extrapolation. To understand our best theories,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: we must take them seriously as explanations of reality, and not regard them, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: as mere summaries of existing observations. The Turing principle is our best, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theory of the foundations of computation. Of course we know only a finite, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: number of instances confirming it — but that is true of every theory in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: science. There remains, and will always remain, the logical possibility that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: universality holds only approximately. But there is no rival theory of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: computation claiming that. And with good reason, for a ‘principle of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: approximate universality’ would have no explanatory power. If, for instance,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: we want to understand why the world seems comprehensible, the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explanation might be that the world is comprehensible. Such an explanation, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: can, and in fact does, fit in with other explanations in other fields. But the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theory that the world is half-comprehensible explains nothing and could not, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: possibly fit in with explanations in other fields unless they explained it. It, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: simply restates the problem and introduces an unexplained constant, one-, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: half. In short, what justifies assuming that the full Turing principle holds at, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the end of the universe, is that any other assumption spoils good, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explanations of what is happening here and now., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Now, it turns out that the type of oscillations of space that would make an, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: omega point happen are highly unstable (in the manner of classical chaos), Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: as well as violent. And they become increasingly more so, without limit, as, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the omega point is approached. A small deviation from the correct shape, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: would be magnified rapidly enough for the conditions for continuing, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: computation to be violated, so the Big Crunch would happen after only a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: finite number of computational steps. Therefore, to satisfy the Turing, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: principle and attain an omega point, the universe would have to be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: continually ‘steered’ back onto the right trajectories. Tipler has shown in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: principle how this could be done, by manipulating the gravitational field over, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the whole of space. Presumably (again we would need a quantum theory of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: gravity to know for sure), the technology used for the stabilizing, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: mechanisms, and for storing information, would have to be continually, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: improved — indeed, improved an infinite number of times — as the density, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and stresses became ever higher without limit. This would require the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: continual creation of new knowledge, which, Popperian epistemology tells, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: us, requires the presence of rational criticism and thus of intelligent entities., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: We have therefore inferred, just from the Turing principle and some other, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: independently justifiable assumptions, that intelligence will survive, and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: knowledge will continue to be created, until the end of the universe., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: The stabilization procedures, and the accompanying knowledge-creation, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: processes, will all have to be increasingly rapid until, in the final frenzy, an, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: infinite amount of both occur in a finite time. We know of no reason why the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: physical resources should not be available to do this, but one might wonder, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: why the inhabitants should bother to go to so much trouble. Why should they, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: continue so carefully to steer the gravitational oscillations during, say, the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: last second of the universe? If you have only one second left to live, why not, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: just sit back and take it easy at last? But of course, that is a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: misrepresentation of the situation. It could hardly be a bigger, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: misrepresentation. For these people’s minds will be running as computer, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: programs in computers whose physical speed is increasing without limit., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Their thoughts will, like ours, be virtual-reality renderings performed by these, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: computers. It is true that at the end of that final second the whole, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: sophisticated mechanism will be destroyed. But we know that the subjective, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: duration of a virtual-reality experience is determined not by the elapsed time,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: but by the computations that are performed in that time. In an infinite number, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of computational steps there is time for an infinite number of thoughts —, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: plenty of time for the thinkers to place themselves into any virtual-reality, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: environment they like, and to experience it for however long they like. If they, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: tire of it, they can switch to any other environment, or to any number of other, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: environments they care to design. Subjectively, they will not be at the final, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: stages of their lives but at the very beginning. They will be in no hurry, for, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: subjectively they will live for ever. With one second, or one microsecond, to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: go, they will still have ‘all the time in the world’ to do more, experience more,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: create more — infinitely more — than anyone in the multiverse will ever have, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: done before then. So there is every incentive for them to devote their, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: attention to managing their resources. In doing so they are merely preparing, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: for their own future, an open, infinite future of which they will be in full control, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and on which, at any particular time, they will be only just embarking., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: We may hope that the intelligence at the omega point will consist of our, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: descendants. That is to say, of our intellectual descendants, since our, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: present physical forms could not survive near the omega point. At some, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: stage human beings would have to transfer the computer programs that are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: their minds into more robust hardware. Indeed, this will eventually have to be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: done an infinite number of times., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: The mechanics of ‘steering’ the universe to the omega point require actions, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to be taken throughout space. It follows that intelligence will have to spread, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: all over the universe in time to make the first necessary adjustments. This is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: one of a series of deadlines that Tipler has shown we should have to meet, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: — and he has shown that meeting each of them is, to the best of our present, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: knowledge, physically possible. The first deadline is (as I remarked in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Chapter 8) about five billion years from now when the Sun will, if left to its, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: own devices, become a red giant star and wipe us out. We must learn to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: control or abandon the Sun before then. Then we must colonize our Galaxy,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: then the local cluster of galaxies, and then the whole universe. We must do, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: each of these things soon enough to meet the corresponding deadline but, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: we must not advance so quickly that we use up all the necessary resources, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: before we have developed the next level of technology., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: I say ‘we must’ do all this, but that is only on the assumption that it is we who, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: are the ancestors of the intelligence that will exist at the omega point. We, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: need not play this role if we do not want to. If we choose not to, and the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Turing principle is true, then we can be sure that someone else (presumably, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: some extraterrestrial intelligence) will., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Meanwhile, in parallel universes, our counterparts are making the same, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: choices. Will they all succeed? Or, to put that another way, will someone, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: necessarily succeed in creating an omega point in our universe? This, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: depends on the fine detail of the Turing principle. It says that a universal, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: computer is physically possible, and ‘possible’ usually means ‘actual in this, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: or some other universe’. Does the principle require a universal computer to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: be built in all universes, or only in some — or perhaps in ‘most’? We do not, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: yet understand the principle well enough to decide. Some principles of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: physics, such as the principle of the conservation of energy, hold only over a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: group of universes and may under some circumstances be violated in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: individual universes. Others, such as the principle of the conservation of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: charge, hold strictly in every universe. The two simplest forms of the Turing, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: principle would be:, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:   , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: (1) there is a universal computer in all universes; or, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: (2) there is a universal computer in at least some universes., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:   , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: The ‘all universes’ version seems too strong to express the intuitive idea that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: such a computer is physically possible. But ‘at least some universes’ seems, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: too weak since, on the face of it, if universality holds only in very few, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: universes then it loses its explanatory power. But a ‘most universes’ version, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: would require the principle to specify a particular percentage, say 85 per, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: cent, which seems very implausible. (There are no ‘natural’ constants in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: physics, goes the maxim, except zero, one and infinity.) Therefore Tipler in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: effect opts for ‘all universes’, and I agree that this is the most natural choice,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: given what little we know., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: That is all that the omega-point theory — or, rather, the scientific component, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: I am defending — has to say. One can reach the same conclusion from, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: several different starting-points in three of the four strands. One of them is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the epistemological principle that reality is comprehensible. That principle too, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: is independently justifiable in so far as it underlies Popperian epistemology., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: But its existing formulations are all too vague for categorical conclusions, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: about, say, the unboundedness of physical representations of knowledge, to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: be drawn from it. That is why I prefer not to postulate it directly, but to infer it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: from the Turing principle. (This is another example of the greater explanatory, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: power that is available when one considers the four strands as being jointly, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: fundamental.) Tipler himself relies either on the postulate that life will, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: continue for ever, or on the postulate that information processing will, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: continue for ever. From our present perspective, neither of these postulates, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: seems fundamental. The advantage of the Turing principle is that it is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: already, for reasons quite independent of cosmology, regarded as a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: fundamental principle of nature — admittedly not always in this strong form,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: but I have argued that the strong form is necessary if the principle is to be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: integrated into physics. {1}, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Tipler makes the point that the science of cosmology has tended to study the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: past (indeed, mainly the distant past) of spacetime. But most of spacetime, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: lies to the future of the present epoch. Existing cosmology does address the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: issue of whether the universe will or will not recollapse, but apart from that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: there has been very little theoretical investigation of the greater part of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: spacetime. In particular, the lead-up to the Big Crunch has received far less, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: study than the aftermath of the Big Bang. Tipler sees the omega-point theory, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: as filling that gap. I believe that the omega-point theory deserves to become, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the prevailing theory of the future of spacetime until and unless it is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: experimentally (or otherwise) refuted. (Experimental refutation is possible, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: because the existence of an omega point in our future places certain, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: constraints on the condition of the universe today.), Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Having established the omega-point scenario, Tipler makes some additional, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: assumptions — some plausible, others less so — which enable him to fill in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: more details of future history. It is Tipler’s quasi-religious interpretation of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that future history, and his failure to distinguish that interpretation from the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: underlying scientific theory, that have prevented the latter from being taken, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: seriously. Tipler notes that an infinite amount of knowledge will have been, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: created by the time of the omega point. He then assumes that the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: intelligences existing in this far future will, like us, want (or perhaps need) to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: discover knowledge other than what is immediately necessary for their, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: survival. Indeed, they have the potential to discover all knowledge that is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: physically knowable, and Tipler assumes that they will do so., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: So in a sense, the omega point will be omniscient., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: But only in a sense. In attributing properties such as omniscience or even, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: physical existence to the omega point, Tipler makes use of a handy linguistic, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: device that is quite common in mathematical physics, but can be misleading, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: if taken too literally. The device is to identify a limiting point of a sequence, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: with the sequence itself. Thus, when he says that the omega point ‘knows’, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: X, he means that X is known by some finite entity before the time of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: omega point, and is never subsequently forgotten. What he does not mean, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: is that there is a knowing entity literally at the end-point of gravitational, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: collapse, for there is no physical entity there at all. {2}  Thus in the most, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: literal sense the omega point knows nothing, and can be said to ‘exist’ only, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: because some of our explanations of the fabric of reality refer to the limiting, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: properties of physical events in the distant future., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Tipler uses the theological term ‘omniscient’ for a reason which will shortly, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: become apparent; but let me note at once that in this usage it does not carry, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: its full traditional connotation. The omega point will not know everything. The, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: overwhelming majority of abstract truths, such as truths about Cantgotu, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: environments and the like, will be as inaccessible to it as they are to us. {3}, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Now, since the whole of space will be filled with the intelligent computer, it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: will be omnipresent (though only after a certain date). Since it will be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: continually rebuilding itself, and steering the gravitational collapse, it can be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: said to be in control of everything that happens in the material universe (or, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: multiverse, if the omega-point phenomenon happens in all universes). So,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Tipler says, it will be omnipotent. But again, this omnipotence is not, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: absolute. On the contrary, it is strictly limited to the available matter and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: energy, and is subject to the laws of physics. {4}, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Since the intelligences in the computer will be creative thinkers, they must be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: classified as ‘people’. Any other classification, Tipler rightly argues, would be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: racist. And so he claims that at the omega-point limit there is an omniscient,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: omnipotent, omnipresent society of people. This society, Tipler identifies as, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: God., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: I have mentioned several respects in which Tipler’s ‘God’ differs from the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: God or gods that most religious people believe in. There are further, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: differences, too. For instance, the people near the omega point could not,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: even if they wanted to, speak to us or communicate their wishes to us, or, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: work miracles (today). {5} They did not create the universe, and they did not, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: invent the laws of physics — nor could they violate those laws if they wanted, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to. They may listen to prayers from the present day (perhaps by detecting, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: very faint signals), but they cannot answer them. They are (and this we can, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: infer from Popperian epistemology) opposed to religious faith, and have no, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: wish to be worshipped. And so on. But Tipler ploughs on, and argues that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: most of the core features of the God of the Judaeo-Christian religions are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: also properties of the omega point. Most religious people will, I think,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: disagree with Tipler about what the core features of their religions are. {6}, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: In particular, Tipler points out that a sufficiently advanced technology will be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: able to resurrect the dead. It could do this in several different ways, of which, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the following is perhaps the simplest. Once one has enough computer power, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: (and remember that eventually any desired amount will be available), one, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: can run a virtual-reality rendering of the entire universe — indeed, the entire, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: multiverse starting at the Big Bang, with any desired degree of accuracy. If, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: one does not know the initial state accurately enough, one can try an, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: arbitrarily fine sampling of all possible initial states, and render them all, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: simultaneously. The rendering may have to pause, for reasons of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: complexity, if the epoch being rendered gets too close to the actual time at, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: which the rendering is being performed. But it will soon be able to continue, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: as more computer power comes on line. To the omega-point computers,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: nothing is intractable. There is only ‘computable’ and ‘non-computable’, and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: rendering real physical environments definitely comes into the ‘computable’, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: category. In the course of this rendering, the planet Earth and many variants, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of it will appear. Life, and eventually human beings, will evolve. All the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: human beings who have ever lived anywhere in the multiverse (that is, all, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: those whose existence was physically possible) will appear somewhere in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: this vast rendering. So will every extraterrestrial and artificial intelligence that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: could ever have existed. The controlling program can look out for these, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: intelligent beings and, if it wants to, place them in a better virtual, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: environment — one, perhaps, in which they will not die again, and will have, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: all their wishes granted (or at least, all wishes that a given, unimaginably, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: high, level of computing resources can meet). Why would it do that? One, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: reason might be a moral one: by the standards of the distant future, the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: environment we live in today is extremely harsh and we suffer atrociously. It, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: may be considered unethical not to rescue such people and give them a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: chance of a better life. But it would be counter-productive to place them, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: immediately in contact with the contemporary culture at the time of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: resurrection: they would be instantly confused, humiliated and overwhelmed., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Therefore, Tipler says, we can expect to be resurrected in an environment of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: a type that is essentially familiar to us, except that every unpleasant element, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: will have been removed, and many extremely pleasant elements will have, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: been added. In other words, heaven., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Tipler goes on in this manner to reconstitute many other aspects of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: traditional religious landscape by redefining them as physical entities or, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: processes that can plausibly be expected to exist near the omega point., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Now, let us set aside the question whether the reconstituted versions are, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: true to their religious analogues. The whole story about what these far-future, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: intelligences will or will not do is based on a string of assumptions. Even if, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: we concede that these assumptions are individually plausible, the overall, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: conclusions cannot really claim to be more than informed speculation. Such, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: speculations are worth making, but it is important to distinguish them from, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the argument for the existence of the omega point itself, and from the theory, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of the omega point’s physical and epistemological properties. For those, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: arguments assume no more than that the fabric of reality does indeed, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: conform to our best theories, an assumption that can be independently, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: justified., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: As a warning against the unreliability of even informed speculation, let me, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: revisit the ancient master builder of Chapter 1, with his pre-scientific, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: knowledge of architecture and engineering. We are separated from him by, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: so large a cultural gap that it would be extremely difficult for him to conceive, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: a workable picture of our civilization. But we and he are almost, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: contemporaries in comparison with the tremendous gap between us and the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: earliest possible moment of Tiplerian resurrection. Now, suppose that the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: master builder is speculating about the distant future of the building industry,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and that by some extraordinary fluke he happens upon a perfectly accurate, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: assessment of the technology of the present day. Then he will know, among, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: other things, that we are capable of building structures far vaster and more, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: impressive than the greatest cathedrals of his day. We could build a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: cathedral a mile high if we chose to. And we could do it using a far smaller, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: proportion of our wealth, and less time and human effort, than he would, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: have needed to build even a modest cathedral. So he would have been, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: confident in predicting that by the year 2000 there would be mile-high, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: cathedrals. He would be mistaken, and badly so, for though we have the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: technology to build such structures, we have chosen not to. Indeed, it now, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: seems unlikely that such a cathedral will ever be built. Even though we, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: supposed our near-contemporary to be right about our technology, he would, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: have been quite wrong about our preferences. He would have been wrong, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: because some of his most unquestioned assumptions about human, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: motivations have become obsolete after only a few centuries., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Similarly, it may seem natural to us that the omega-point intelligences, for, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: reasons of historical or archaeological research, or compassion, or moral, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: duty, or mere whimsy, will eventually create virtual-reality renderings of us,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and that when their experiment is over they will grant us the piffling, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: computational resources we would require to live for ever in ‘heaven’. (I, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: myself would prefer to be allowed gradually to join their culture.) But we, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: cannot know what they will want. Indeed, no attempt to prophesy future, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: large-scale developments in human (or superhuman) affairs can produce, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: reliable results. As Popper has pointed out, the future course of human, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: affairs depends on the future growth of knowledge. And we cannot predict, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: what specific knowledge will be created in the future — because if we could,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: we should by definition already possess that knowledge in the present. {7}, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: It is not only scientific knowledge that informs people’s preferences and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: determines how they choose to behave. There are also, for instance, moral, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: criteria, which assign attributes such as ‘right’ and ‘wrong’ to possible, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: actions. Such values have been notoriously difficult to accommodate in the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: scientific world-view. They seem to form a closed explanatory structure of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: their own, disconnected from that of the physical world. As David Hume, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: pointed out, it is impossible logically to derive an ‘ought’ from an ‘is’. Yet we, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: use such values both to explain and to determine our physical actions., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: The poor relation of morality is usefulness. Since it seems much easier to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: understand what is objectively useful or useless than what is objectively right, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: or wrong, there have been many attempts to define morality in terms of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: various forms of usefulness. There is, for example, evolutionary morality,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: which notes that many forms of behaviour which we explain in moral terms,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: such as not committing murder, or not cheating when we cooperate with, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: other people, have analogues in the behaviour of animals. And there is a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: branch of evolutionary theory, sociobiology, that has had some success in, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explaining animal behaviour. Many people have been tempted to conclude, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that moral explanations for human choices are just window-dressing; that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: morality has no objective basis at all, and that ‘right’ and ‘wrong’ are simply, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: tags we apply to our inborn urges to behave in one way rather than another., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Another version of the same explanation replaces genes by memes, and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: claims that moral terminology is just window-dressing for social conditioning., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: However, none of these explanations fits the facts. On the one hand, we do, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: not tend to explain inborn behaviour — say, epileptic fits — in terms of moral, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: choices; we have a notion of voluntary and involuntary actions, and only the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: voluntary ones have moral explanations. On the other hand, it is hard to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: think of a single inborn human behaviour — avoiding pain, engaging in sex,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: eating or whatever — that human beings have not under various, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: circumstances chosen to override for moral reasons. The same is true, even, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: more commonly, of socially conditioned behaviour. Indeed, overriding both, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: inborn and socially conditioned behaviours is itself a characteristic human, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: behaviour. So is explaining such rebellions in moral terms. None of these, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: behaviours has any analogue among animals; in none of these cases can, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: moral explanations be reinterpreted in genetic or memetic terms. This is a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: fatal flaw of this entire class of theories. Could there be a gene for overriding, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: genes when one feels like it? Social conditioning that promotes rebellion?, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Perhaps, but that still leaves the problem of how we choose what to do, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: instead, and of what we mean when we explain our rebellion by claiming that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: we were simply right, and that the behaviour prescribed by our genes or by, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: our society in this situation was simply evil., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: These genetic theories can be seen as a special case of a wider stratagem,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that of denying that moral judgements are meaningful on the grounds that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: we do not really choose our actions — that free will is an illusion, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: incompatible with physics. But in fact, as we saw in Chapter 13, free will is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: compatible with physics, and fits quite naturally into the fabric of reality that I, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: have described., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  Utilitarianism was an earlier attempt to integrate moral explanations with the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: scientific world-view through ‘usefulness’. Here ‘usefulness’ was identified, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: with human happiness. Making moral choices was identified with calculating, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: which action would produce the most happiness, either for one person or, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: (and the theory became more vague here) for ‘the greatest number’ of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: people. Different versions of the theory substituted ‘pleasure’ or ‘preference’, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: for ‘happiness’. Considered as a repudiation of earlier, authoritarian systems, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: of morality, utilitarianism is unexceptionable. And in the sense that it simply, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: advocates rejecting dogma and acting on the ‘preferred’ theory, the one that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: has survived rational criticism, every rational person is a utilitarian. But as an, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: attempt to solve the problem we are discussing here, of explaining the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: meaning of moral judgements, it too has a fatal flaw: we choose our, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: preferences. In particular, we change our preferences, and we give moral, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explanations for doing so. Such an explanation cannot be translated into, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: utilitarian terms. Is there an underlying, master-preference that controls, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: preference changes? If so, it could not itself be changed, and utilitarianism, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: would degenerate into the genetic theory of morality discussed above., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: What, then, is the relationship of moral values to the particular scientific, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: world-view I am advocating in this book? I can at least argue that there is no, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: fundamental obstacle to formulating one. The problem with all previous, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘scientific world-views’ was that they had hierarchical explanatory structures., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Just as it is impossible, within such a structure, to ‘justify’ scientific theories, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: as being true, so one cannot justify a course of action as being right, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: (because then, how would one justify the structure as a whole as being, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: right?). As I have said, each of the four strands has a hierarchical, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explanatory structure. But the fabric of reality as a whole does not. So, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explaining moral values as objective attributes of physical processes need, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: not amount to deriving them from anything, even in principle. Just as with, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: abstract mathematical entities, it will be a matter of what they contribute to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the explanation — whether physical reality can or cannot be understood, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: without also attributing reality to such values., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: In this connection, let me point out that ‘emergence’ in the standard sense is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: only one way in which explanations in different strands may be related. So, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: far I have really only considered what might be called predictive emergence., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: For example, we believe that the predictions of the theory of evolution follow, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: logically from the laws of physics, even though proving the connection might, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: be computationally intractable. But the explanations in the theory of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: evolution are not believed to follow from physics at all. However, a non-, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: hierarchical explanatory structure allows for the possibility of explanatory, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: emergence. Suppose, for the sake of argument, that a given moral, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: judgement can be explained as being right in some narrow utilitarian sense., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: For instance: ‘I want it; it harms no one; so it is right.’ Now, that judgement, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: might one day be called into question. I might wonder, ‘Should I want it?’ Or,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘Am I really right that it harms no one?’ — for the issue of whom I judge the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: action to ‘harm’ itself depends on moral assumptions. My sitting quietly in a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: chair in my own home ‘harms’ everyone on Earth who might benefit from my, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: going out and helping them at that moment; and it ‘harms’ any number of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: thieves who would like to steal the chair if only I went elsewhere for a while;, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and so on. To resolve such issues, I adduce further moral theories involving, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: new explanations of my moral situation. When such an explanation seems, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: satisfactory, I shall use it tentatively to make judgements of right and wrong., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: But the explanation, though temporarily satisfactory to me, still does not rise, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: above the utilitarian level., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: But now suppose that someone forms a general theory about such, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explanations themselves. Suppose that they introduce a higher-level, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: concept, such as ‘human rights’, and guess that the introduction of that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: concept will, for a given class of moral problems like the one I have just, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: described, always generate a new explanation that solves the problem in the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: utilitarian sense. Suppose, further, that this theory about explanations is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: itself an explanatory theory. It explains, in terms of some other strand, why, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: analysing problems in terms of human rights is ‘better’ (in the utilitarian, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: sense). For example, it might explain on epistemological grounds why, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: respect for human rights can be expected to promote the growth of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: knowledge, which is itself a precondition for solving moral problems., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: If the explanation seems good, it might be worth adopting such a theory., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Furthermore, since utilitarian calculations are impossibly difficult to perform,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: whereas analysing a situation in terms of human rights is often feasible, it, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: may be worth using a ‘human rights’ analysis in preference to any specific, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theory of what the happiness implications of a particular action are. If all this, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: were true, it could be that the concept of ‘human rights’ is not expressible,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: even in principle, in terms of ‘happiness’ — that it is not a utilitarian concept, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: at all. We may call it a moral concept. The connection between the two is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: through emergent explanation, not emergent prediction., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: I am not especially advocating this particular approach; I am merely, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: illustrating the way in which moral values might exist objectively by playing a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: role in emergent explanations. If this approach did work, then it would, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: explain morality as a sort of ‘emergent usefulness’., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: In a similar way, ‘artistic value’ and other aesthetic concepts have always, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: been difficult to explain in objective terms. They too are often explained, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: away as arbitrary features of culture, or in terms of inborn preferences. And, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: again we see that this is not necessarily so. Just as morality is related to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: usefulness, so artistic value has a less exalted but more objectively definable, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: counterpart, design. Again, the value of a design feature is understandable, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: only in the context of a given purpose for the designed object. But we may, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: find that it is possible to improve designs by incorporating a good aesthetic, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: criterion into the design criteria. Such aesthetic criteria would be incalculable, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: from the design criteria; one of their uses would be to improve the design, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: criteria themselves. The relationship would again be one of explanatory, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: emergence. And artistic value, or beauty, would be a sort of emergent, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: design., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Tipler’s overconfidence in predicting people’s motives near the omega point, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: has caused him to underrate an important implication of the omega-point, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theory for the role of intelligence in the multiverse. It is that intelligence is not, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: only there to control physical events on the largest scale, it is also there to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: choose what will happen. The ends of the universe are, as Popper said, for, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: us to choose. Indeed, to a large extent the content of future intelligent, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: thoughts is what will happen, for in the end the whole of space and its, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: contents will be the computer. The universe will in the end consist, literally,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of intelligent thought-processes. Somewhere towards the far end of these, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: materialized thoughts lies, perhaps, all physically possible knowledge,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: expressed in physical patterns., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Moral and aesthetic deliberations are also expressed in those patterns, as, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: are the outcomes of all such deliberations. Indeed, whether or not there is an, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: omega point, wherever there is knowledge in the multiverse (complexity, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: across many universes) there must also be the physical traces of the moral, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and aesthetic reasoning that determined what sort of problems the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: knowledge-creating entity chose to solve there. In particular, before any, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: piece of factual knowledge can become similar across a swathe of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: universes, moral and aesthetic judgements must already have been similar, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: across those universes. It follows that such judgements also contain, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: objective knowledge in the physical, multiverse sense. This justifies the use, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of epistemological terminology such as ‘problem’, ‘solution’, ‘reasoning’ and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘knowledge’ in ethics and aesthetics. Thus, if ethics and aesthetics are at all, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: compatible with the world-view advocated in this book, beauty and tightness, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: must be as objective as scientific or mathematical truth. And they must be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: created in analogous ways, through conjecture and rational criticism., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: So Keats had a point when he said that ‘beauty is truth, truth beauty’. They, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: are not the same thing, but they are the same sort of thing, they are created, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: in the same way, and they are inseparably related. (But he was of course, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: know’.), Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: In his enthusiasm (in the original sense of the word!), Tipler has neglected, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: part of the Popperian lesson about what the growth of knowledge must look, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: like. If the omega point exists, and if it will be created in the way that Tipler, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: has set out, then the late universe will indeed consist of embodied thoughts, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of inconceivable wisdom, creativity and sheer numbers. But thought is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: problem-solving, and problem-solving means rival conjectures, errors,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: criticism, refutation and backtracking. Admittedly, in the limit (which no one, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: experiences), at the instant when the universe ends, everything that is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: comprehensible may have been understood. But at every finite point our, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: descendants’ knowledge will be riddled with errors. Their knowledge will be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: controversies. For this reason it seems unlikely that it could usefully be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: regarded as a ‘person’. Rather, it will be a vast number of people interacting, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: at many levels and in many different ways, but disagreeing. They will not, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: speak with one voice, any more than present-day scientists at a research, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: (another difference, surely, from conventional religion!), and people will, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: the Omega Point will not know the unknowable (such as the Cantgotu, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: medieval theological terminology, God’s “omnipotence” was taken to mean, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that God can do anything except something involving a logical contradiction., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: In particular, God could not make a stone so heavy that even He could not, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: lift it. In other words, traditional theology does not consider the inability to do, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: something logically contradictory to limit God. It so happens that the dispute, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: between Galileo and Pope Urban VIII involved this point, but both Galileo, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: just one history. There is no reason to rule out other multiverses with other, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: laws of physics, in which the Turing Principle also holds. This implies we, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: should regard the Omega Point, the completion of ALL the multiverses, as, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: mechanism which He uses to communicate and perform miracles works as, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: follows. The Turing Principle is a final boundary condition on the universe:, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the universe simply must evolve into the Omega Point. As Deutsch has, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: pointed earlier in this extract, intelligent life must guide the universe into the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Omega Point. If we decline to do so, some other intelligent life form will. If, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: necessary, some other intelligent life form will be evolved elsewhere to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: replace us when we falter. Since the evolution of the universe is chaotic, the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: history of life is unpredictable in detail, but its broad features are predictable:, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the universe must evolve into the Omega Point. Thus if a certain historical, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: event, completely unexpected and unpredictable given the state of life at that, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: time, is necessary for the evolution of the universe into the Omega Point,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: that event will necessarily occur. Such a event, which can be inferred only, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: from the requirement that the Omega Point exist, is what is meant by the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: “direct action of the Omega Point in the world today;” i.e., this is what is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: meant by “a miracle”. A miracle is thus an event which is certain given the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Omega Point’s existence (its true probability is 1), but if we ignore the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Omega Point’s existence, we would think the event exceedingly improbable., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: For example, evolutionary biologists believe that the evolution of intelligent, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text: life is very unlikely to have occurred even once in a closed universe of the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: maximum size allowed by unitarity. But the evolution of intelligent life is, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: inevitable. Therefore (if the evolutionists are correct), intelligent life is a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: miracle, created by the direct action of the Omega Point! Asa Gray, the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Harvard botanist who was Darwin’s chief 19th century defender in America,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: argued in his book Darwiniana that the “random” mutations required by, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Darwinism were merely unpredictable by biological means; they were really, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: (at least in part) directed by God. Gray’s claim is a necessary inference of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the Omega Point Theory. The fundamentalist leader William Jennings Bryan, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: and Pope John Paul II announced that they could accept Darwinian, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: evolution provided it is granted that humans qua rational beings are created, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: by God’s direct intervention. (See Edward Larson’s Pulitzer Prize winning, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: book Summer for the Gods, pages 130-31 (Basic Books, 1997), for Bryan’s, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: opinion, and the recent encyclical on evolution for the Pope’s opinion.) The, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Omega Point Theory says such a miracle — act of God — did in fact take, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: place (if the evolutionists are correct). Similarly, if “random” fluctuations in a, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0

Text:  Tipler replies: I find it extraordinary that Deutsch would use the opinions of, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the average religious person as the touchstone of truth. As a Popperian,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Deutsch should expect a leading theologian — such as Pannenberg — to be, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: a much better critic of a theological theory than a non-expert. In fact,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: theologians and ordinary believers have given quite different meanings to, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: the expressions “prayer” and “worshipping God”. By “prayer”, the average, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: person (and Deutsch) means “petitioning a powerful being for a favor”, and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: by “worshipping”, the average person (and Deutsch) means “fawning on the, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: powerful being in hopes that this fawning will induce him to grant the favor.”, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: But in his circa 200 AD book On Prayer, the first great Christian theologian, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Origin pointed out that both of these meanings were inappropriate as applied, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to God. According to Origin, petitionatory prayer is ridiculous because an, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: omniscient God already knows what you want, and an all-loving and, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: omnipotent God will grant it to you automatically if the granting is logically, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: possible, and if the granting will not mess up the cosmic plan (and/or you)., Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: Origin pointed out that “prayer” and “worshipping” instead mean “opening, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: oneself to God’s message”. You can’t tell Him anything He doesn’t know, but, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: He can tell you something. Another form of prayer is “thinking about God”,, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: which is what you are doing as you read this. By “religious faith” Deutsch, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: appears to mean “accepting a theory without criticism, and/or not permitting, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: criticism of the theory.” Certainly the people of the far future will be opposed, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: to faith in this sense, for the reason Deutsch gives. But the core assertions, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: of the Judeo-Christian “faith” have always been defended by rational, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
Text: argument. In I Kings 18: 22-39, the prophet Elijah asserted that the question, Font: Helvetica, Size: 12.0
