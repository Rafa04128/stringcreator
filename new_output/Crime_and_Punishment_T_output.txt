Text: A few words about Dostoevsky himself may help the , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: English reader to understand his work. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: Dostoevsky was the son of a doctor. His parents were , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: very hard- working and deeply religious people, but so , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: poor that they lived with their five children in only two , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: ‘Poor Folk.’ , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: This story was published by the poet Nekrassov in his , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: unknown youth found himself instantly something of a , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: celebrity. A brilliant and successful career seemed to open , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: before him, but those hopes were soon dashed. In 1849 he , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: Proudhon. He was accused of ‘taking part in conversations , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: against the censorship, of reading a letter from Byelinsky , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: to Gogol, and of knowing of the intention to set up a , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: printing press.’ Under Nicholas I. (that ‘stern and just , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: man,’ as Maurice Baring calls him) this was enough, and , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: he was condemned to death. After eight months’ , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: imprisonment he was with twenty-one others taken out to , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: the Semyonovsky Square to be shot. Writing to his , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: brother Mihail, Dostoevsky says: ‘They snapped words , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: over our heads, and they made us put on the white shirts , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: worn by persons condemned to death. Thereupon we , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: were bound in threes to stakes, to suffer execution. Being , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: the third in the row, I concluded I had only a few minutes , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: of life before me. I thought of you and your dear ones and , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: I contrived to kiss Plestcheiev and Dourov, who were , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: next to me, and to bid them farewell. Suddenly the troops , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: beat a tattoo, we were unbound, brought back upon the , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: scaffold, and informed that his Majesty had spared us our , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: lives.’ The sentence was commuted to hard labour. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: One of the prisoners, Grigoryev, went mad as soon as , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: he was untied, and never regained his sanity. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: The intense suffering of this experience left a lasting , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: stamp on Dostoevsky’s mind. Though his religious temper , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: led him in the end to accept every suffering with , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: He had shown signs of some obscure nervous disease , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: before his arrest and this now developed into violent , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: attacks of epilepsy, from which he suffered for the rest of , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: his life. The fits occurred three or four times a year and , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: were more frequent in periods of great strain. In 1859 he , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: was allowed to return to Russia. He started a journal— , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘Vremya,’ which was forbidden by the Censorship , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: through a misunderstanding. In 1864 he lost his first wife , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: and his brother Mihail. He was in terrible poverty, yet he , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: took upon himself the payment of his brother’s debts. He , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: started another journal—‘The Epoch,’ which within a few , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: months was also prohibited. He was weighed down by , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: debt, his brother’s family was dependent on him, he was , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: In June 1880 he made his famous speech at the , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: A few months later Dostoevsky died. He was followed , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: the most widely read writer in Russia. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: In the words of a Russian critic, who seeks to explain , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: the feeling inspired by Dostoevsky: ‘He was one of , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: has suffered and has seen so much more deeply than we , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: Chapter I , Font: Bembo-Bold, Size: 13.5
Text: On an exceptionally hot evening early in July a young , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: man came out of the garret in which he lodged in S. Place , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: and walked slowly, as though in hesitation, towards K. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: bridge. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: He had successfully avoided meeting his landlady on , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: the staircase. His garret was under the roof of a high, five-, Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: storied house and was more like a cupboard than a room. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: The landlady who provided him with garret, dinners, and , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: attendance, lived on the floor below, and every time he , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: went out he was obliged to pass her kitchen, the door of , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: which invariably stood open. And each time he passed, the , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: young man had a sick, frightened feeling, which made him , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: scowl and feel ashamed. He was hopelessly in debt to his , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: landlady, and was afraid of meeting her. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: This was not because he was cowardly and abject, quite , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: the contrary; but for some time past he had been in an , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: overstrained irritable condition, verging on hypochondria. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: He had become so completely absorbed in himself, and , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: isolated from his fellows that he dreaded meeting, not only , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: his landlady, but anyone at all. He was crushed by poverty, , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: but the anxieties of his position had of late ceased to weigh , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: upon him. He had given up attending to matters of , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text:  967 , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: practical importance; he had lost all desire to do so. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: Nothing that any landlady could do had a real terror for , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: him. But to be stopped on the stairs, to be forced to listen , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: to her trivial, irrelevant gossip, to pestering demands for , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: payment, threats and complaints, and to rack his brains for , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: excuses, to prevaricate, to lie—no, rather than that, he , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: would creep down the stairs like a cat and slip out unseen. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: This evening, however, on coming out into the street, , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: he became acutely aware of his fears. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘I want to attempt a thing , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: like that, Font: Bembo-Italic, Size: 12.0
Text:  and am frightened by , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: these trifles,’ he thought, with an odd smile. ‘Hm … yes, , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: all is in a man’s hands and he lets it all slip from cowardice, , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: that’s an axiom. It would be interesting to know what it is , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: men are most afraid of. Taking a new step, uttering a new , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: word is what they fear most…. But I am talking too , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: much. It’s because I chatter that I do nothing. Or perhaps , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: it is that I chatter because I do nothing. I’ve learned to , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: chatter this last month, lying for days together in my den , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: thinking … of Jack the Giant-killer. Why am I going , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: there now? Am I capable of , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: that, Font: Bembo-Italic, Size: 12.0
Text: ? Is , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: that, Font: Bembo-Italic, Size: 12.0
Text:  serious? It is not , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: serious at all. It’s simply a fantasy to amuse myself; a , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: plaything! Yes, maybe it is a plaything.’ , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: town, and the drunken men whom he met continually, , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: although it was a working day, completed the revolting , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: misery of the picture. An expression of the profoundest , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: disgust gleamed for a moment in the young man’s refined , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: face. He was, by the way, exceptionally handsome, above , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: the average in height, slim, well-built, with beautiful dark , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: eyes and dark brown hair. Soon he sank into deep , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: thought, or more accurately speaking into a complete , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: blankness of mind; he walked along not observing what , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: was about him and not caring to observe it. From time to , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: time, he would mutter something, from the habit of , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: talking to himself, to which he had just confessed. At these , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: moments he would become conscious that his ideas were , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: sometimes in a tangle and that he was very weak; for two , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: days he had scarcely tasted food. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: He was so badly dressed that even a man accustomed to , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: shabbiness would have been ashamed to be seen in the , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: Petersburg, types so various were to be seen in the streets , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: that no figure, however queer, would have caused , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: surprise. But there was such accumulated bitterness and , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: contempt in the young man’s heart, that, in spite of all the , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: fastidiousness of youth, he minded his rags least of all in , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: the street. It was a different matter when he met with , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: acquaintances or with former fellow students, whom, , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: indeed, he disliked meeting at any time. And yet when a , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: drunken man who, for some unknown reason, was being , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: taken somewhere in a huge waggon dragged by a heavy , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: dray horse, suddenly shouted at him as he drove past: ‘Hey , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: there, German hatter’ bawling at the top of his voice and , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: pointing at him—the young man stopped suddenly and , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: clutched tremulously at his hat. It was a tall round hat , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: from Zimmerman’s, but completely worn out, rusty with , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: age, all torn and bespattered, brimless and bent on one side , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: in a most unseemly fashion. Not shame, however, but , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: quite another feeling akin to terror had overtaken him. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: wears such a hat, it would be noticed a mile off, it would , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: it was from the gate of his lodging house: exactly seven , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: those dreams and was only tantalising himself by their , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: the monologues in which he jeered at his own impotence , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: sitting a little distance from him, who looked like a retired , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: clerk. The young man often recalled this impression , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: looked repeatedly at the clerk, partly no doubt because the , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: enter into conversation. At the other persons in the room, , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: including the tavern- keeper, the clerk looked as though , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: he were used to their company, and weary of it, showing a , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: shade of condescending contempt for them as persons of , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: station and culture inferior to his own, with whom it , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: fifty, bald and grizzled, of medium height, and stoutly , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: built. His face, bloated from continual drinking, was of a , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: yellow, even greenish, tinge, with swollen eyelids out of , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: which keen reddish eyes gleamed like little chinks. But , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: there was something very strange in him; there was a light , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: with all its buttons missing except one, and that one he , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: respectability. A crumpled shirt front, covered with spots , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: superfluous. In this way she was busy for , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: several days in driving about the whole , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: town, because some people had taken , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: offence through precedence having been , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: given to others. And therefore they had to , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: without asking your consent, I think you , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: and begged for a speedy and decided , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: answer. He is a very busy man and is in a , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: man, to be depended upon, he has two , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: prepossessing appearance and might still be , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: morose and somewhat conceited. But , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: explained to me that, though he is not a , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: man of great education, he is clever and , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: seems to be good-natured. You know your , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: Of course, there is no great love either on , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: make it her duty to make her husband , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: good reason to doubt, though it must be , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: admitted the matter has been arranged in , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: great haste. Besides he is a man of great , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: prudence and he will see, to be sure, of , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: himself, that his own happiness will be the , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: more secure, the happier Dounia is with , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: for some habits and even certain differences , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: of opinion —which indeed are inevitable , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: a great deal, if only their future relationship , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: rather abrupt, but that may well come from , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: his being an outspoken man, and that is no , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: doubt how it is. For instance, at his second , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: visit, after he had received Dounia’s , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: consent, in the course of conversation, he , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: declared that before making Dounia’s , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: acquaintance, he had made up his mind to , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: marry a girl of good reputation, without , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: dowry and, above all, one who had , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: experienced poverty, because, as he , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: explained, a man ought not to be indebted , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: to his wife, but that it is better for a wife to , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: look upon her husband as her benefactor. I , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: must add that he expressed it more nicely , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: and politely than I have done, for I have , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: forgotten his actual phrases and only , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: remember the meaning. And, besides, it , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: was obviously not said of design, but , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: slipped out in the heat of conversation, so , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: that he tried afterwards to correct himself , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: and smooth it over, but all the same it did , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: strike me as somewhat rude, and I said so , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: ‘She is first-rate,’ he said. ‘You can always get money , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: that she had a sister Lizaveta, whom the wretched little , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: pledge, Font: Bembo-Italic, Size: 12.0
Text:  which he had got , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: ready long before and hidden there. This pledge was, , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: however, only a smoothly planed piece of wood the size , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: and thickness of a silver cigarette case. He picked up this , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: piece of wood in one of his wanderings in a courtyard , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: where there was some sort of a workshop. Afterwards he , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: had added to the wood a thin smooth piece of iron, which , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: he had also picked up at the same time in the street. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: Putting the iron which was a little the smaller on the piece , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: of wood, he fastened them very firmly, crossing and re-, Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: crossing the thread round them; then wrapped them , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: carefully and daintily in clean white paper and tied up the , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: parcel so that it would be very difficult to untie it. This , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: was in order to divert the attention of the old woman for a , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: gain a moment. The iron strip was added to give weight, , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: so that the woman might not guess the first minute that , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: like a cat. He had still the most important thing to do—to , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: steal the axe from the kitchen. That the deed must be , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: done with an axe he had decided long ago. He had also a , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: pocket pruning-knife, but he could not rely on the knife , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: and still less on his own strength, and so resolved finally on , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: the axe. We may note in passing, one peculiarity in regard , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: to all the final resolutions taken by him in the matter; they , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: had one strange characteristic: the more final they were, , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: the more hideous and the more absurd they at once , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: became in his eyes. In spite of all his agonising inward , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: struggle, he never for a single instant all that time could , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: believe in the carrying out of his plans. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: And, indeed, if it had ever happened that everything to , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: the least point could have been considered and finally , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: would, it seems, have renounced it all as something , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text:  967 , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: the axe, that trifling business cost him no anxiety, for , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: nothing could be easier. Nastasya was continually out of , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: the house, especially in the evenings; she would run in to , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: the neighbours or to a shop, and always left the door ajar. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: It was the one thing the landlady was always scolding her , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: about. And so, when the time came, he would only have , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: to go quietly into the kitchen and to take the axe, and an , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: hour later (when everything was over) go in and put it , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: back again. But these were doubtful points. Supposing he , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: returned an hour later to put it back, and Nastasya had , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: come back and was on the spot. He would of course have , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: to go by and wait till she went out again. But supposing , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: she were in the meantime to miss the axe, look for it, , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: make an outcry —that would mean suspicion or at least , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: grounds for suspicion. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: But those were all trifles which he had not even begun , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: to consider, and indeed he had no time. He was thinking , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: of the chief point, and put off trifling details, until , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: he could , Font: Bembo-Italic, Size: 12.0
Text: believe in it all, Font: Bembo-Italic, Size: 12.0

Text: up and simply go there…. Even his late experiment (i.e. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: that his analysis was complete; his casuistry had become , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: criminals leave such obvious traces? He had come , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: gradually to many different and curious conclusions, and , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: in his opinion the chief reason lay not so much in the , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: material impossibility of concealing the crime, as in the , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: phenomenal heedlessness, at the very instant when , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: that his reason and will would remain unimpaired at the , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: From the porter’s room, two paces away from him, , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: something shining under the bench to the right caught his , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: out from under the bench, where it lay between two , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: considering the building of great fountains, and of their , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: refreshing effect on the atmosphere in all the squares. By , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: degrees he passed to the conviction that if the summer , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: joined to the garden of the Mihailovsky Palace, it would , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: be a splendid thing and a great benefit to the town. Then , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: peculiar way inclined to live in those parts of the town , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: ‘So probably men led to execution clutch mentally at , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: to dismiss this thought…. And by now he was near; here , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: was the house, here was the gate. Suddenly a clock , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: Impossible, it must be fast!’ , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: Luckily for him, everything went well again at the , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: through into the yard, before he had slipped in a flash to , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: He could stand it no longer, he slowly put out his hand to , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: loudly. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: No answer. To go on ringing was useless and out of , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: was suspicious and alone. He had some knowledge of her , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: habits … and once more he put his ear to the door. Either , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: his senses were peculiarly keen (which it is difficult to , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: The door was as before opened a tiny crack, and again , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: it towards him to prevent the old woman from attempting , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: to shut it again. Seeing this she did not pull the door back, , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: but she did not let go the handle so that he almost dragged , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: standing in the doorway not allowing him to pass, he , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: advanced straight upon her. She stepped back in alarm, , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: tried to say something, but seemed unable to speak and , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: unloosed. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘Good heavens! What it is? Who is it? What do you , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: ‘Why, , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: The old woman glanced for a moment at the pledge, , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: but at once stared in the eyes of her uninvited visitor. She , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: looked intently, maliciously and mistrustfully. A minute , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: passed; he even fancied something like a sneer in her eyes, , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: as though she had already guessed everything. He felt that , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: he was losing his head, that he was almost frightened, so , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: frightened that if she were to look like that and not say a , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: word for another half minute, he thought he would have , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: run away from her. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘Why do you look at me as though you did not know , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: me?’ he said suddenly, also with malice. ‘Take it if you , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: like, if not I’ll go elsewhere, I am in a hurry.’ , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: He had not even thought of saying this, but it was , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: suddenly said of itself. The old woman recovered herself, , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: and her visitor’s resolute tone evidently restored her , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: ‘The silver cigarette case; I spoke of it last time, you , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: She held out her hand. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘But how pale you are, to be sure … and your hands , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: are trembling too? Have you been bathing, or what?’ , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘Fever,’ he answered abruptly. ‘You can’t help getting , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: articulating the words. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: His strength was failing him again. But his answer , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: sounded like the truth; the old woman took the pledge. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘What is it?’ she asked once more, scanning , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: ‘A thing … cigarette case…. Silver…. Look at it.’ , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘It does not seem somehow like silver…. How he has , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: to the light (all her windows were shut, in spite of the , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: stifling heat), she left him altogether for some seconds and , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: stood with her back to him. He unbuttoned his coat and , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: afraid he would let the axe slip and fall…. A sudden , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: giddiness came over him. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘But what has he tied it up like this for?’ the old , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: woman cried with vexation and moved towards him. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: He had not a minute more to lose. He pulled the axe , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: quite out, swung it with both arms, scarcely conscious of , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: himself, and almost without effort, almost mechanically, , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: brought the blunt side down on her head. He seemed not , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: to use his own strength in this. But as soon as he had once , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: brought the axe down, his strength returned to him. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: The old woman was as always bareheaded. Her thin, , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: was plaited in a rat’s tail and fastened by a broken horn , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: comb which stood out on the nape of her neck. As she , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: was so short, the blow fell on the very top of her skull. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: She cried out, but very faintly, and suddenly sank all of a , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: heap on the floor, raising her hands to her head. In one , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: hand she still held ‘the pledge.’ Then he dealt her another , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: and another blow with the blunt side and on the same , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: spot. The blood gushed as from an overturned glass, the , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: bent over her face; she was dead. Her eyes seemed to be , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: He laid the axe on the ground near the dead body and , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: felt at once in her pocket (trying to avoid the streaming , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: body)—the same right-hand pocket from which she had , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: taken the key on his last visit. He was in full possession of , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: his faculties, free from confusion or giddiness, but his , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: hands were still trembling. He remembered afterwards that , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: he had been particularly collected and careful, trying all , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: the time not to get smeared with blood…. He pulled out , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: the keys at once, they were all, as before, in one bunch on , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: a steel ring. He ran at once into the bedroom with them. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: It was a very small room with a whole shrine of holy , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: images. Against the other wall stood a big bed, very clean , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: and covered with a silk patchwork wadded quilt. Against a , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: third wall was a chest of drawers. Strange to say, so soon as , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: he began to fit the keys into the chest, so soon as he heard , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: their jingling, a convulsive shudder passed over him. He , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: But that was only for an instant; it was too late to go back. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: He positively smiled at himself, when suddenly another , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: terrifying idea occurred to his mind. He suddenly fancied , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: that the old woman might be still alive and might recover , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: her senses. Leaving the keys in the chest, he ran back to , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: the old woman, but did not bring it down. There was no , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: doubt that she was dead. Bending down and examining , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: her again more closely, he saw clearly that the skull was , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: broken and even battered in on one side. He was about to , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: feel it with his finger, but drew back his hand and indeed , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: it was evident without that. Meanwhile there was a perfect , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: pool of blood. All at once he noticed a string on her neck; , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: he tugged at it, but the string was strong and did not snap , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: and besides, it was soaked with blood. He tried to pull it , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: out from the front of the dress, but something held it and , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: prevented its coming. In his impatience he raised the axe , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: again to cut the string from above on the body, but did , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: not dare, and with difficulty, smearing his hand and the , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: axe in the blood, after two minutes’ hurried effort, he cut , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: the string and took it off without touching the body with , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: the axe; he was not mistaken—it was a purse. On the , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: string were two crosses, one of Cyprus wood and one of , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: copper, and an image in silver filigree, and with them a , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: small greasy chamois leather purse with a steel rim and , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: in his pocket without looking at it, flung the crosses on , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: began trying them again. But he was unsuccessful. They , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: would not fit in the locks. It was not so much that his , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: though he saw for instance that a key was not the right , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: he remembered and realised that the big key with the deep , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: notches, which was hanging there with the small keys , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: could not possibly belong to the chest of drawers (on his , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: that everything perhaps was hidden in that box. He left , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: the chest of drawers, and at once felt under the bedstead, , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: knowing that old women usually keep boxes under their , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: beds. And so it was; there was a good-sized box under the , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: bed, at least a yard in length, with an arched lid covered , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: with red leather and studded with steel nails. The notched , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: key fitted at once and unlocked it. At the top, under a , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: white sheet, was a coat of red brocade lined with hareskin; , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: under it was a silk dress, then a shawl and it seemed as , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: though there was nothing below but clothes. The first , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: thing he did was to wipe his blood- stained hands on the , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: red brocade. ‘It’s red, and on red blood will be less , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: But no sooner did he touch the clothes than a gold , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: made of gold among the clothes—probably all pledges, , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: unredeemed or waiting to be redeemed—bracelets, chains, , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: would have flung up everything, and would have gone to , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: give himself up, and not from fear, but from simple horror , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: and loathing of what he had done. The feeling of loathing , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: especially surged up within him and grew stronger every , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: into the room for anything in the world. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: But a sort of blankness, even dreaminess, had begun by , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: degrees to take possession of him; at moments he forgot , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: himself, or rather, forgot what was of importance, and , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: caught at trifles. Glancing, however, into the kitchen and , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: seeing a bucket half full of water on a bench, he bethought , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: him of washing his hands and the axe. His hands were , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: sticky with blood. He dropped the axe with the blade in , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: the water, snatched a piece of soap that lay in a broken , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: saucer on the window, and began washing his hands in the , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: blood rubbing them with soap. Then he wiped it all with , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: some linen that was hanging to dry on a line in the , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: kitchen and then he was a long while attentively , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: examining the axe at the window. There was no trace left , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: on it, only the wood was still damp. He carefully hung the , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: axe in the noose under his coat. Then as far as was , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: possible, in the dim light in the kitchen, he looked over , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: his overcoat, his trousers and his boots. At the first glance , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: there seemed to be nothing but stains on the boots. He , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: wetted the rag and rubbed the boots. But he knew he was , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: not looking thoroughly, that there might be something , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: quite noticeable that he was overlooking. He stood in the , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: middle of the room, lost in thought. Dark agonising ideas , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: rose in his mind—the idea that he was mad and that at , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: that moment he was incapable of reasoning, of protecting , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: himself, that he ought perhaps to be doing something , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: utterly different from what he was now doing. ‘Good , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: He listened a long time. Somewhere far away, it might , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: shouting, quarrelling and scolding. ‘What are they about?’ , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: He waited patiently. At last all was still, as though , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: suddenly cut off; they had separated. He was meaning to , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: go out, but suddenly, on the floor below, a door was , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: noisily opened and someone began going downstairs , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: humming a tune. ‘How is it they all make such a noise?’ , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: flashed through his mind. Once more he closed the door , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: and waited. At last all was still, not a soul stirring. He was , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: just taking a step towards the stairs when he heard fresh , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: The steps sounded very far off, at the very bottom of , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: that from the first sound he began for some reason to , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: suspect that this was someone coming , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: there, Font: Bembo-Italic, Size: 12.0
Text:  to the fourth , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: floor, to the old woman. Why? Were the sounds , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: somehow peculiar, significant? The steps were heavy, even , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: and unhurried. Now , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: he, Font: Bembo-Italic, Size: 12.0
Text:  had passed the first floor, now he , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: was mounting higher, it was growing more and more , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: distinct! He could hear his heavy breathing. And now the , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: third storey had been reached. Coming here! And it , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: caught and will be killed, and is rooted to the spot and , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: cannot even move one’s arms. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: At last when the unknown was mounting to the fourth , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: and quickly back into the flat and closing the door behind , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: him. Then he took the hook and softly, noiselessly, fixed , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: it in the catch. Instinct helped him. When he had done , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: this, he crouched holding his breath, by the door. The , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: unknown visitor was by now also at the door. They were , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: now standing opposite one another, as he had just before , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: been standing with the old woman, when the door , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: the bell and rang it loudly. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: As soon as the tin bell tinkled, Raskolnikov seemed to , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: be aware of something moving in the room. For some , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: seconds he listened quite seriously. The unknown rang , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: again, waited and suddenly tugged violently and , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: impatiently at the handle of the door. Raskolnikov gazed , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: in horror at the hook shaking in its fastening, and in blank , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: terror expected every minute that the fastening would be , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: pulled out. It certainly did seem possible, so violently was , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: he shaking it. He was tempted to hold the fastening, but , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: he, Font: Bembo-Italic, Size: 12.0

Text: ‘I shall fall down!’ flashed through his mind, but the , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: once. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘What’s up? Are they asleep or murdered? D-damn , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: door! Oh, damn them! Are they asleep or what?’ , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: And again, enraged, he tugged with all his might a , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: and only in the nick of time; they had already reached the , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: ran down the stairs. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: No one was on the stairs, nor in the gateway. He , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: He knew, he knew perfectly well that at that moment , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: they were at the flat, that they were greatly astonished at , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: finding it unlocked, as the door had just been fastened, , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: that by now they were looking at the bodies, that before , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: another minute had passed they would guess and , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: completely realise that the murderer had just been there, , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: and had succeeded in hiding somewhere, slipping by them , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: and escaping. They would guess most likely that he had , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: been in the empty flat, while they were going upstairs. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: And meanwhile he dared not quicken his pace much, , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: though the next turning was still nearly a hundred yards , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: away. ‘Should he slip through some gateway and wait , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: somewhere in an unknown street? No, hopeless! Should , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: dead than alive. Here he was half way to safety, and he , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: understood it; it was less risky because there was a great , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: crowd of people, and he was lost in it like a grain of sand. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: But all he had suffered had so weakened him that he could , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: however, that on coming out on to the canal bank, he was , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: alarmed at finding few people there and so being more , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: conspicuous, and he had thought of turning back. Though , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: he was almost falling from fatigue, he went a long way , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: round so as to get home from quite a different direction. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: He was not fully conscious when he passed through the , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: gateway of his house! he was already on the staircase , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: observation as far as possible in doing so. He was of course , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: incapable of reflecting that it might perhaps be far better , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: not to restore the axe at all, but to drop it later on in , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: had so completely lost all power of reflection that he , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: walked straight to the door and opened it. If the porter , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: had asked him, ‘What do you want?’ he would perhaps , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: wood as before. He met no one, not a soul, afterwards on , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: far into the night, but it did not occur to him to get up. At , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: lying on his back, still dazed from his recent oblivion. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: Fearful, despairing cries rose shrilly from the street, sounds , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: which he heard every night, indeed, under his window , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: after two o’clock. They woke him up now. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘Ah! the drunken men are coming out of the taverns,’ , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: he thought, ‘it’s past two o’clock,’ and at once he leaped , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: up, as though someone had pulled him from the sofa. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘What! Past two o’clock!’ , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: He sat down on the sofa—and instantly recollected , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: everything! All at once, in one flash, he recollected , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: everything. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: For the first moment he thought he was going mad. A , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: dreadful chill came over him; but the chill was from the , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: fever that had begun long before in his sleep. Now he was , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: suddenly taken with violent shivering, so that his teeth , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: chattered and all his limbs were shaking. He opened the , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: door and began listening—everything in the house was , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: everything in the room around him, wondering how he , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: could have come in the night before without fastening the , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: door, and have flung himself on the sofa without , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: undressing, without even taking his hat off. It had fallen , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: off and was lying on the floor near his pillow. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘If anyone had come in, what would he have thought? , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: He rushed to the window. There was light enough, , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: and he began hurriedly looking himself all over from head , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: to foot, all his clothes; were there no traces? But there was , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: no doing it like that; shivering with cold, he began taking , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: off everything and looking over again. He turned , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: everything over to the last threads and rags, and , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: mistrusting himself, went through his search three times. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: But there seemed to be nothing, no trace, except in , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: one place, where some thick drops of congealed blood , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: were clinging to the frayed edge of his trousers. He picked , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: up a big claspknife and cut off the frayed threads. There , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: seemed to be nothing more. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: Suddenly he remembered that the purse and the things , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: he had taken out of the old woman’s box were still in his , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: pockets! He had not thought till then of taking them out , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: When he had pulled out everything, and turned the , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: pocket inside out to be sure there was nothing left, he , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: carried the whole heap to the corner. The paper had come , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: ‘They’re in! All out of sight, and the purse too!’ he , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: concentration he fell to gazing about him again, at the , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: ‘Ah! Then there must be blood on the pocket too, for I , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: yes!—there were traces, stains on the lining of the pocket! , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘So my reason has not quite deserted me, so I still have , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: Raskolnikov gave back the pen; but instead of getting , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: up and going away, he put his elbows on the table and , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: pressed his head in his hands. He felt as if a nail were being , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: driven into his skull. A strange idea suddenly occurred to , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: off the burden without thinking.’ But all at once he stood , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: still, rooted to the spot. Nikodim Fomitch was talking , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: eagerly with Ilya Petrovitch, and the words reached him: , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘It’s impossible, they’ll both be released. To begin with, , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: the whole story contradicts itself. Why should they have , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: against themselves? Or as a blind? No, that would be too , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: cunning! Besides, Pestryakov, the student, was seen at the , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: was walking with three friends, who left him only at the , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: He rushed to the corner, slipped his hand under the , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: them. There were eight articles in all: two little boxes , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: with ear-rings or something of the sort, he hardly looked , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: to see; then four small leather cases. There was a chain, , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: too, merely wrapped in newspaper and something else in , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: newspaper, that looked like a decoration…. He put them , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: all in the different pockets of his overcoat, and the , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: remaining pocket of his trousers, trying to conceal them as , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: quickly and resolutely, and though he felt shattered, he , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: clear everything up while he still had some strength, some , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: reasoning power left him…. Where was he to go? , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: That had long been settled: ‘Fling them into the canal, , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: and all traces hidden in the water, the thing would be at , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: an end.’ So he had decided in the night of his delirium , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: when several times he had had the impulse to get up and , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: go away, to make haste, and get rid of it all. But to get rid , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: of it, turned out to be a very difficult task. He wandered , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: along the bank of the Ekaterininsky Canal for half an hour , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: or more and looked several times at the steps running , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: down to the water, but he could not think of carrying out , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: his plan; either rafts stood at the steps’ edge, and women , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: were washing clothes on them, or boats were moored , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: there, and people were swarming everywhere. Moreover , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: he could be seen and noticed from the banks on all sides; , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: it would look suspicious for a man to go down on , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: purpose, stop, and throw something into the water. And , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: what if the boxes were to float instead of sinking? And of , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: course they would. Even as it was, everyone he met , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: seemed to stare and look round, as if they had nothing to , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: do but to watch him. ‘Why is it, or can it be my fancy?’ , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text:  967 , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: At last the thought struck him that it might be better to , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: go to the Neva. There were not so many people there, he , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: would be less observed, and it would be more convenient , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: in every way, above all it was further off. He wondered , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: how he could have been wandering for a good half- hour, , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: worried and anxious in this dangerous past without , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: thinking of it before. And that half-hour he had lost over , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: an irrational plan, simply because he had thought of it in , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: delirium! He had become extremely absent and forgetful , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: and he was aware of it. He certainly must make haste. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: He walked towards the Neva along V—— Prospect, , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: but on the way another idea struck him. ‘Why to the , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: Neva? Would it not be better to go somewhere far off, to , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: the Islands again, and there hide the things in some solitary , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: place, in a wood or under a bush, and mark the spot , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: perhaps?’ And though he felt incapable of clear judgment, , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: the idea seemed to him a sound one. But he was not , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: destined to go there. For coming out of V—— Prospect , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: towards the square, he saw on the left a passage leading , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: between two blank walls to a courtyard. On the right , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: hand, the blank unwhitewashed wall of a four-storied , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: house stretched far into the court; on the left, a wooden , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: smutty, stone shed, apparently part of some workshop, , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: carriage builder’s or carpenter’s shed; the whole place from , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: the entrance was black with coal dust. Here would be the , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: place to throw it, he thought. Not seeing anyone in the , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: such as is often put in yards where there are many , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: workmen or cab-drivers; and on the hoarding above had , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: been scribbled in chalk the time-honoured witticism, , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘Standing here strictly forbidden.’ This was all the better, , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: for there would be nothing suspicious about his going in. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘Here I could throw it all in a heap and get away!’ , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: Looking round once more, with his hand already in his , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: pocket, he noticed against the outer wall, between the , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: entrance and the sink, a big unhewn stone, weighing , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: perhaps sixty pounds. The other side of the wall was a , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: part, but he could not be seen from the entrance, unless , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: someone came in from the street, which might well , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: happen indeed, so there was need of haste. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: He bent down over the stone, seized the top of it , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: and he immediately emptied his pocket into it. The purse , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: lay at the top, and yet the hollow was not filled up. Then , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: he seized the stone again and with one twist turned it , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: back, so that it was in the same position again, though it , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: stood a very little higher. But he scraped the earth about it , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: and pressed it at the edges with his foot. Nothing could be , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: noticed. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: Then he went out, and turned into the square. Again , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: an intense, almost unbearable joy overwhelmed him for an , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: instant, as it had in the police-office. ‘I have buried my , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: stone? It has been lying there most likely ever since the , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: were found, who would think of me? It is all over! No , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: though asking himself what sort of place he had come to. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: Mistrustfully and with an affectation of being alarmed and , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: almost affronted, he scanned Raskolnikov’s low and , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: Raskolnikov, who lay undressed, dishevelled, unwashed, , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: Raskolnikov himself lay without speaking, on his back, , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: because this shabby and impudent person had introduced , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: ‘Your mamma,’ began Luzhin. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: I purposely allowed a few days to elapse before coming to , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: ‘I know, I know!’ Raskolnikov cried suddenly with , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: fiancé, Font: Bembo-Italic, Size: 12.0
Text: ? I know, and , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: that’s enough!’ , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: There was no doubt about Pyotr Petrovitch’s being , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: offended this time, but he said nothing. He made a violent , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: effort to understand what it all meant. There was a , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: moment’s silence. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: Meanwhile Raskolnikov, who had turned a little , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: had struck him; he rose from his pillow on purpose to , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: stare at him. There certainly was something peculiar in , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: Pyotr Petrovitch’s whole appearance, something which , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: seemed to justify the title of ‘fiancé’ so unceremoniously , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: applied to him. In the first place, it was evident, far too , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: much so indeed, that Pyotr Petrovitch had made eager use , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: of his few days in the capital to get himself up and rig , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: himself out in expectation of his betrothed—a perfectly , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: innocent and permissible proceeding, indeed. Even his , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: own, perhaps too complacent, consciousness of the , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: agreeable improvement in his appearance might have been , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: forgiven in such circumstances, seeing that Pyotr , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: Petrovitch had taken up the rôle of fiancé. All his clothes , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: were fresh from the tailor’s and were all right, except for , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: being too new and too distinctly appropriate. Even the , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: stylish new round hat had the same significance. Pyotr , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: Petrovitch treated it too respectfully and held it too , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: carefully in his hands. The exquisite pair of lavender , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: gloves, real Louvain, told the same tale, if only from the , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: fact of his not wearing them, but carrying them in his , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: hand for show. Light and youthful colours predominated , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: handsome face looked younger than his forty-five years at , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: shining, clean-shaven chin. Even his hair, touched here , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: and there with grey, though it had been combed and , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: ‘I feel the greatest regret at finding you in this , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: ‘… Any minute. I have found a lodging for them on , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: ‘Where?’ asked Raskolnikov weakly. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘Very near here, in Bakaleyev’s house.’ , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘That’s in Voskresensky,’ put in Razumihin. ‘There are , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: ‘Yes, rooms …’ , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘A disgusting place—filthy, stinking and, what’s more, , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: ‘Yes, Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov, a clerk in , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: ‘Yes … no,’ Raskolnikov answered. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘Excuse me, I fancied so from your inquiry. I was once , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: ‘That’s true,’ Zossimov let drop. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘Nonsense! There’s no practicality.’ Razumihin flew at , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: drop down from heaven. And for the last two hundred , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: years we have been divorced from all practical life. Ideas, if , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: weaker that he could scarcely reach this place. He longed , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: to sit or lie down somewhere in the street. Bending over , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: flashed before his eyes, the houses seemed moving, the , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: passers-by, the canal banks, the carriages, all danced before , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: swooning by an uncanny and hideous sight. He became , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: aware of someone standing on the right side of him; he , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: looked and saw a tall woman with a kerchief on her head, , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: and looked round him with curiosity; on the first landing , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: the framework of the window had been taken out. ‘That , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: wasn’t so then,’ he thought. Here was the flat on the , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: second storey where Nikolay and Dmitri had been , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: working. ‘It’s shut up and the door newly painted. So it’s , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: was perplexed to find the door of the flat wide open. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: There were men there, he could hear voices; he had not , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: somehow fancied that he would find everything as he left , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: it, even perhaps the corpses in the same places on the , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: strange. He walked to the window and sat down on the , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: window-sill. There were two workmen, both young , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: a child, with a modest and refined manner, with a candid , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: embarrassed as completely overwhelmed with shyness, like , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: He laid special emphasis on the delirium. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘Yes, yes,’ Razumihin hastened to agree—with what , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: was not clear. ‘Then that’s why you … were stuck … , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: ‘Shall we find him?’ he asked suddenly. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: he is a man of polished manners, but I mean clumsy in a , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: incredulous, sceptical, cynical … he likes to impose on , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: But it does not follow from that that Newton had a right , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: Lycurgus, Solon, Mahomet, Napoleon, and so on, were all , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: without exception criminals, from the very fact that, , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: handed down from their ancestors and held sacred by the , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: controlled, because that’s their vocation, and there is , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: nothing humiliating in it for them. The second category , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: all transgress the law; they are destroyers or disposed to , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: destruction according to their capacities. The crimes of , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: in my article (you remember it began with the legal , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: standing wide open, he hesitated and went in. It was very , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: dark and empty in the passage, as though everything had , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: you what; I have an uncle, I must introduce him to you (a , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: most accommodating and respectable old man). This uncle , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: has got a capital of a thousand roubles, and he lives on his , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: pension and has no need of that money. For the last two , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: pay him six per cent. interest. I know what that means; he , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text:  967 , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: Then Razumihin began to unfold his project, and he , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: explained at length that almost all our publishers and , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: booksellers know nothing at all of what they are selling, , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: and for that reason they are usually bad publishers, and , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: that any decent publications pay as a rule and give a profit, , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: sometimes a considerable one. Razumihin had, indeed, , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: been dreaming of setting up as a publisher. For the last , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: two years he had been working in publishers’ offices, and , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: knew three European languages well, though he had told , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: Raskolnikov six days before that he was ‘schwach’ in , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: German with an object of persuading him to take half his , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: ‘Why, why should we let our chance slip when we , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: lodging. Sonia’s room looked like a barn; it was a very , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: ‘No, no! It can’t be, no!’ Sonia cried aloud in , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: ‘You say Katerina Ivanovna’s mind is unhinged; your , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: Five minutes passed. He still paced up and down the , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: room in silence, not looking at her. At last he went up to , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: her; his eyes glittered. He put his two hands on her , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: shoulders and looked straight into her tearful face. His eyes , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: were hard, feverish and piercing, his lips were twitching. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: All at once he bent down quickly and dropping to the , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: ‘What are you doing to me?’ she muttered, turning , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: pale, and a sudden anguish clutched at her heart. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: He stood up at once. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘I did not bow down to you, I bowed down to all the , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: suffering of humanity,’ he said wildly and walked away to , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: the window. ‘Listen,’ he added, turning to her a minute , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: later. ‘I said just now to an insolent man that he was not , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: ‘Ach, you said that to them! And in her presence?’ , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: ‘It was not because of your dishonour and your sin I , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: said that of you, but because of your great suffering. But , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: you are a great sinner, that’s true,’ he added almost , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: solemnly, ‘and your worst sin is that you have destroyed , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: and betrayed yourself , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: gazing at him with eyes of anguish, but not seeming , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: surprised at his suggestion. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: Raskolnikov looked strangely at her. He read it all in , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: her face; so she must have had that thought already, , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: perhaps many times, and earnestly she had thought out in , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: her despair how to end it and so earnestly, that now she , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: scarcely wondered at his suggestion. She had not even , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: noticed the cruelty of his words. (The significance of his , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: reproaches and his peculiar attitude to her shame she had, , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: of course, not noticed either, and that, too, was clear to , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: disgraceful, shameful position was torturing her and had , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: long tortured her. ‘What, what,’ he thought, ‘could , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: of education, her previous life might, one would have , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: The noise behind the door increased, and suddenly the , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: ‘What is it?’ cried Porfiry Petrovitch, annoyed. ‘Why, I , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: For an instant there was no answer, but it was evident , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: that there were several persons at the door, and that they , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: were apparently pushing somebody back. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘What is it?’ Porfiry Petrovitch repeated, uneasily. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘The prisoner Nikolay has been brought,’ someone , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: ‘But he …’ began the same voice, and suddenly ceased. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: Two seconds, not more, were spent in actual struggle, , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: There was a determined gleam in his eyes; at the same , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: time there was a deathly pallor in his face, as though he , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: were being led to the scaffold. His white lips were faintly , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: twitching. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: He was dressed like a workman and was of medium , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: height, very young, slim, his hair cut in round crop, with , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: thin spare features. The man whom he had thrust back , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: followed him into the room and succeeded in seizing him , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: by the shoulder; he was a warder; but Nikolay pulled his , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: arm away. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: Several persons crowded inquisitively into the , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: ‘Go away, it’s too soon! Wait till you are sent for! … , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: muttered, extremely annoyed, and as it were thrown out , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: of his reckoning. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: But Nikolay suddenly knelt down. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘What’s the matter?’ cried Porfiry, surprised. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘I am guilty! Mine is the sin! I am the murderer,’ , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: For ten seconds there was silence as though all had , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: mechanically retreated to the door, and stood immovable. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘What is it?’ cried Porfiry Petrovitch, recovering from , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: his momentary stupefaction. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘I … am the murderer,’ repeated Nikolay, after a brief , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: ‘What … you … what … whom did you kill?’ Porfiry , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: ‘Alyona Ivanovna and her sister Lizaveta Ivanovna, I … , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: suddenly, and was again silent. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: He still remained on his knees. Porfiry Petrovitch stood , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: for some moments as though meditating, but suddenly , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: roused himself and waved back the uninvited spectators. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: They instantly vanished and closed the door. Then he , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: looked towards Raskolnikov, who was standing in the , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: ‘I suppose you didn’t expect it?’ said Raskolnikov who, , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: ‘And your little surprise, aren’t you going to show it to , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: the, Font: Bembo-Italic, Size: 12.0

Text: that night to the police station. They stood there waiting. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: But he was no sooner on the stairs than he heard the voice , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: of Porfiry Petrovitch behind him. Turning round, he saw , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: the latter running after him, out of breath. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘One word, Rodion Romanovitch; as to all the rest, it’s , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: He seemed to want to say something more, but could , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: not speak out. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘You must forgive me, Porfiry Petrovitch, for what has , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: inclined to display his coolness. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘Don’t mention it, don’t mention it,’ Porfiry replied, , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: I admit it! But we shall meet again. If it’s God’s will, we , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: may see a great deal of one another.’ , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘And will get to know each other through and , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: Porfiry Petrovitch, and he screwed up his eyes, looking , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: earnestly at Raskolnikov. ‘Now you’re going to a birthday , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: ‘To a funeral.’ , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: ‘I don’t know what to wish you,’ said Raskolnikov, , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: who had begun to descend the stairs, but looked back , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: again. ‘I should like to wish you success, but your office is , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: ‘Why comical?’ Porfiry Petrovitch had turned to go, , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: ‘Why, how you must have been torturing and harassing , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: And the whole scene of the day before yesterday in the , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: gateway came clearly before Raskolnikov’s mind; he , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: recollected that there had been several people there besides , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: the porters, women among them. He remembered one , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: voice had suggested taking him straight to the police- , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: even now he did not recognise it, but he remembered that , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: he had turned round and made him some answer…. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: So this was the solution of yesterday’s horror. The most , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: awful thought was that he had been actually almost lost, , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: trivial, Font: Bembo-Italic, Size: 12.0
Text:  , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: what had seemed to him only the day before fantastic and , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: He was afraid that he had jaundice. However his health , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: skinned countenance which had grown fattish of late, , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: Pyotr Petrovitch for an instant was positively comforted in , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: the conviction that he would find another bride and, , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: perhaps, even a better one. But coming back to the sense , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: of his present position, he turned aside and spat vigorously, , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: which excited a sarcastic smile in Andrey Semyonovitch , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: Lebeziatnikov, the young friend with whom he was , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: staying. That smile Pyotr Petrovitch noticed, and at once , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: set it down against his young friend’s account. He had set , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: down a good many points against him of late. His anger , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: made in temper, through impulsiveness and irritability…. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: Moreover, all that morning one unpleasantness followed , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: another. He even found a hitch awaiting him in his legal , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: case in the senate. He was particularly irritated by the , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: owner of the flat which had been taken in view of his , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: approaching marriage and was being redecorated at his , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: own expense; the owner, a rich German tradesman, would , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: not entertain the idea of breaking the contract which had , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: just been signed and insisted on the full forfeit money, , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: though Pyotr Petrovitch would be giving him back the , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: flat practically redecorated. In the same way the , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: upholsterers refused to return a single rouble of the , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: instalment paid for the furniture purchased but not yet , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: removed to the flat. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘Am I to get married simply for the sake of the , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: furniture?’ Pyotr Petrovitch ground his teeth and at the , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: ‘Can all that be really so irrevocably over? Is it no use to , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: make another effort?’ The thought of Dounia sent a , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: that moment, and if it had been possible to slay , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: important part in certain interesting circles, the doings of , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: which were a legend in the provinces. It had impressed , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: Pyotr Petrovitch. These powerful omniscient circles who , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: despised everyone and showed everyone up had long , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: inspired in him a peculiar but quite vague alarm. He had , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: not, of course, been able to form even an approximate , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: notion of what they meant. He, like everyone, had heard , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: that there were, especially in Petersburg, progressives of , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: some sort, nihilists and so on, and, like many people, he , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: exaggerated and distorted the significance of those words , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: to an absurd degree. What for many years past he had , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: feared more than anything was , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: being shown up, Font: Bembo-Italic, Size: 12.0
Text:  and this was , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: the chief ground for his continual uneasiness at the , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: afraid of this as little children are sometimes panic-stricken. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: Some years before, when he was just entering on his own , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: important personages in the province, patrons of his, had , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: been cruelly shown up. One instance had ended in great , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: reached Petersburg and, if necessary, to anticipate , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: as she was a slut she could not judge what made one really , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: in pockets went, and always used to say: ‘Poof! poof!’’ and , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: she leapt up from the table to represent her father, sticking , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: her hands in her pockets, puffing her cheeks, and uttering , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: vague sounds resembling ‘poof! poof!’ amid loud laughter , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: from all the lodgers, who purposely encouraged Amalia , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: Ivanovna, hoping for a fight. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: But this was too much for Katerina Ivanovna, and she , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: Ivanovna probably never had a father, but was simply a , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: drunken Petersburg Finn, and had certainly once been a , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: it was evident, too, that he had come upon some matter of , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: consequence, that some exceptional cause must have , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: brought him and that therefore something was going to , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: you wanted to test her, to see whether, when she found it, , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: Katerina Ivanovna some money for the funeral, as a friend , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: the … character of Sofya Semyonovna, that is, hinted at , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: the character of my attitude to Sofya Semyonovna. All this , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: let Sofya Semyonovna sit down beside my sister, I , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: my mother and sister were unwilling to quarrel with me at , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: his insinuations, he gradually began being unpardonably , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: rude to them. A final rupture took place and he was , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: turned out of the house. All this happened yesterday , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: had now succeeded in proving that Sofya Semyonovna , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: was a thief, he would have shown to my mother and sister , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: that he was almost right in his suspicions, that he had , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: reason to be angry at my putting my sister on a level with , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: Sofya Semyonovna, that, in attacking me, he was , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: protecting and preserving the honour of my sister, his , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: for supposing that the honour and happiness of Sofya , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: wound up his speech which was followed very attentively, , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: though often interrupted by exclamations from his , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: horror and anguish in his own heart. But having gone , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: through so much in the morning, he found a sort of relief , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: in a change of sensations, apart from the strong personal , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: feeling which impelled him to defend Sonia. He was , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: agitated too, especially at some moments, by the thought , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: of his approaching interview with Sonia: he , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: had, Font: Bembo-Italic, Size: 12.0
Text:  to tell her , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: who had killed Lizaveta. He knew the terrible suffering it , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: would be to him and, as it were, brushed away the , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: thought of it. So when he cried as he left Katerina , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: Ivanovna’s, ‘Well, Sofya Semyonovna, we shall see what , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: you’ll say now!’ he was still superficially excited, still , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: vigorous and defiant from his triumph over Luzhin. But, , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: strange to say, by the time he reached Sonia’s lodging, he , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: felt a sudden impotence and fear. He stood still in , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: hesitation at the door, asking himself the strange question: , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘Must he tell her who killed Lizaveta?’ It was a strange , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: question because he felt at the very time not only that he , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: off the telling. He did not yet know why it must be so, he , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: felt, Font: Bembo-Italic, Size: 12.0

Text: the inevitable almost crushed him. To cut short his , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: looked at Sonia from the doorway. She was sitting with , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: Evidently she was in haste to say this to him. It was , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: what she had been waiting for. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: Raskolnikov went to the table and sat down on the , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: chair from which she had only just risen. She stood facing , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: him, two steps away, just as she had done the day before. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘Well, Sonia?’ he said, and felt that his voice was , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: trembling, ‘it was all due to ‘your social position and the , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: though a fog had fallen upon him and wrapped him in a , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: dreary solitude from which there was no escape. Recalling , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: that period long after, he believed that his mind had been , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: clouded at times, and that it had continued so, with , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: intervals, till the final catastrophe. He was convinced that , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: he had been mistaken about many things at that time, for , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: instance as to the date of certain events. Anyway, when he , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: tried later on to piece his recollections together, he learnt , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: a great deal about himself from what other people told , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: him. He had mixed up incidents and had explained events , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: as due to circumstances which existed only in his , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: remembered, too, moments, hours, perhaps whole days, of , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: eating-house, sitting alone lost in thought, hardly knowing , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: dismay that he ought at once to come to an understanding , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: with that man and to make what terms he could. Walking , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: From his childhood the thought of death and the presence , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: slight friendly gesture bewildered Raskolnikov. It seemed , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: strange to him that there was no trace of repugnance, no , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: trace of disgust, no tremor in her hand. It was the furthest , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: Sonia said nothing. Raskolnikov pressed her hand and , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: had never been able to feel alone. Sometimes he walked , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: out of the town on to the high road, once he had even , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: reached a little wood, but the lonelier the place was, the , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: more he seemed to be aware of an uneasy presence near , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: him. It did not frighten him, but greatly annoyed him, so , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: that he made haste to return to the town, to mingle with , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: the crowd, to enter restaurants and taverns, to walk in , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: busy thoroughfares. There he felt easier and even more , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: solitary. One day at dusk he sat for an hour listening to , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: songs in a tavern and he remembered that he positively , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: the only cause of his uneasiness; there was something , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: requiring immediate decision, but it was something he , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: could not clearly understand or put into words. It was a , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: Porfiry again … or Svidrigaïlov…. Better some challenge , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: thought of Dounia and his mother suddenly reduced him , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: There was another thought which had been continually , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: hovering of late about Raskolnikov’s mind, and causing , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: distinct efforts to get rid of it. He sometimes thought that , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: Svidrigaïlov was dogging his footsteps. Svidrigaïlov had , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: against Dounia? , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: This idea sometimes even tormented his dreams, but it , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: had never presented itself so vividly to him as on his way , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: to Svidrigaïlov. The very thought moved him to gloomy , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: rage. To begin with, this would transform everything, , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: even his own position; he would have at once to confess , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: sitting at a tea-table right in the open window with a pipe , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: almost terrified. Svidrigaïlov was silently watching and , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: scrutinising him and, what struck Raskolnikov at once, , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: seemed to be meaning to get up and slip away , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: seen him, but to be looking absent-mindedly away, while , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: he watched him out of the corner of his eye. His heart was , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: beating violently. Yet, it was evident that Svidrigaïlov did , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: not want to be seen. He took the pipe out of his mouth , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: and was on the point of concealing himself, but as he got , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: up and moved back his chair, he seemed to have become , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: suddenly aware that Raskolnikov had seen him, and was , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: watching him. What had passed between them was much , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: the same as what happened at their first meeting in , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: Raskolnikov’s room. A sly smile came into Svidrigaïlov’s , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: Svidrigaïlov stood an open bottle and a glass half full of , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: champagne. In the room he found also a boy with a little , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: hand organ, a healthy-looking red- cheeked girl of , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: eighteen, wearing a tucked-up striped skirt, and a Tyrolese , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: hat with ribbons. In spite of the chorus in the other room, , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: contralto, to the accompaniment of the organ. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘Come, that’s enough,’ Svidrigaïlov stopped her at , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: Raskolnikov’s entrance. The girl at once broke off and , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: after her with the organ. Both had been brought in from , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: speaking the truth, it leads to a discord, and that leads to , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: trouble. But if all, to the last note, is false in flattery, it is , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: just as agreeable, and is heard not without satisfaction. It , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: may be a coarse satisfaction, but still a satisfaction. And , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: seem true. That’s so for all stages of development and , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: classes of society. A vestal virgin might be seduced by , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: flattery. I can never remember without laughter how I , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: annihilated and prostrate before her purity. I flattered her , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: shamelessly, and as soon as I succeeded in getting a , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: pressure of the hand, even a glance from her, I would , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: reproach myself for having snatched it by force, and would , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: declare that she had resisted, so that I could never have , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: maintained that she was so innocent that she could not , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: foresee my treachery, and yielded to me unconsciously, , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: and faithful to all her duties and obligations and had , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: passed his hand over his forehead. A strange smile , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: despair. The blood, which was already getting dry, , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: smeared his hand. He looked angrily at it, then wetted a , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: particularly drawn to these clerks by the fact that they both , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: had crooked noses, one bent to the left and the other to , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: spite of the late hour there were lights in the windows and , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: signs of life within. He went in and asked a ragged fellow , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: who met him in the corridor for a room. The latter, , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: scanning Svidrigaïlov, pulled himself together and led him , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: at once to a close and tiny room in the distance, at the end , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: of the corridor, under the stairs. There was no other, all , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: ‘Yes, sir.’ , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: ‘Nothing, nothing.’ , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: The ragged man went away, completely disillusioned. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: ‘It must be a nice place,’ thought Svidrigaïlov. ‘How , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: café chantant and have had some adventure on the way. It , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: would be interesting to know who stay here?’ , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: He lighted the candle and looked at the room more , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: carefully. It was a room so low-pitched that Svidrigaïlov , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: could only just stand up in it; it had one window; the bed, , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: which was very dirty, and the plain- stained chair and , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: table almost filled it up. The walls looked as though they , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: were made of planks, covered with shabby paper, so torn , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: and dusty that the pattern was indistinguishable, though , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: the general colour—yellow—could still be made out. One , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: of the walls was cut short by the sloping ceiling, though , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: the room was not an attic but just under the stairs. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: Svidrigaïlov set down the candle, sat down on the bed , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: and sank into thought. But a strange persistent murmur , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: which sometimes rose to a shout in the next room , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: attracted his attention. The murmur had not ceased from , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: the moment he entered the room. He listened: someone , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: only one voice. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: Svidrigaïlov got up, shaded the light with his hand and , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: at once he saw light through a crack in the wall; he went , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: up and peeped through. The room, which was somewhat , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: larger than his, had two occupants. One of them, a very , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: curly-headed man with a red inflamed face, was standing , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: in the pose of an orator, without his coat, with his legs , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: wide apart to preserve his balance, and smiting himself on , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: the breast. He reproached the other with being a beggar, , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: with having no standing whatever. He declared that he , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: had taken the other out of the gutter and he could turn , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: him out when he liked, and that only the finger of , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: Providence sees it all. The object of his reproaches was , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: sitting in a chair, and had the air of a man who wants , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: dreadfully to sneeze, but can’t. He sometimes turned , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: sheepish and befogged eyes on the speaker, but obviously , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: had not the slightest idea what he was talking about and , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: scarcely heard it. A candle was burning down on the table; , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: there were wine-glasses, a nearly empty bottle of vodka, , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: bread and cucumber, and glasses with the dregs of stale , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: tea. After gazing attentively at this, Svidrigaïlov turned , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: away indifferently and sat down on the bed. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: resist asking him again whether he didn’t want anything , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: more, and again receiving a negative reply, finally , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: withdrew. Svidrigaïlov made haste to drink a glass of tea to , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: warm himself, but could not eat anything. He began to , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: feel feverish. He took off his coat and, wrapping himself in , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: the blanket, lay down on the bed. He was annoyed. ‘It , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: would have been better to be well for the occasion,’ he , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: thought with a smile. The room was close, the candle , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: burnt dimly, the wind was roaring outside, he heard a , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: mouse scratching in the corner and the room smelt of , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: mice and of leather. He lay in a sort of reverie: one , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: thought followed another. He felt a longing to fix his , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: imagination on something. ‘It must be a garden under the , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: window,’ he thought. ‘There’s a sound of trees. How I , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: dislike the sound of trees on a stormy night, in the dark! , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: They give one a horrid feeling.’ He remembered how he , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: had disliked it when he passed Petrovsky Park just now. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: This reminded him of the bridge over the Little Neva and , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: he felt cold again as he had when standing there. ‘I never , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: he suddenly smiled again at a strange idea: ‘Surely now all , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: cold, ha-ha! As though I were seeking pleasant sensations! , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: … By the way, why haven’t I put out the candle?’ he , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: blew it out. ‘They’ve gone to bed next door,’ he thought, , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: not seeing the light at the crack. ‘Well, now, Marfa , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: Petrovna, now is the time for you to turn up; it’s dark, , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: and the very time and place for you. But now you won’t , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: come!’ , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: He suddenly recalled how, an hour before carrying out , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: his design on Dounia, he had recommended Raskolnikov , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: to trust her to Razumihin’s keeping. ‘I suppose I really did , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: say it, as Raskolnikov guessed, to tease myself. But what a , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: rogue that Raskolnikov is! He’s gone through a good deal. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: He may be a successful rogue in time when he’s got over , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: He could not get to sleep. By degrees Dounia’s image , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: rose before him, and a shudder ran over him. ‘No, I must , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: give up all that now,’ he thought, rousing himself. ‘I must , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: think of something else. It’s queer and funny. I never had , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: Dounia’s image rose before him, just as she was when, , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: after shooting the first time, she had lowered the revolver , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: get up, get cold, but all at once something unpleasant ran , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: over his leg again. He pulled off the blanket and lighted , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: The room was dark. He was lying on the bed and , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: coarser than the rosy cheeks of childhood. ‘It’s a flush of , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: drinking, as though she had been given a full glass to , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: drink. Her crimson lips were hot and glowing; but what , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: perfectly clear. The lawyers and the judges were very , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: much struck, among other things, by the fact that he had , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: hidden the trinkets and the purse under a stone, without , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: making use of them, and that, what was more, he did not , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: now remember what the trinkets were like, or even how , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: many there were. The fact that he had never opened the , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: purse and did not even know how much was in it seemed , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: incredible. There turned out to be in the purse three , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: hundred and seventeen roubles and sixty copecks. From , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: being so long under the stone, some of the most valuable , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: notes lying uppermost had suffered from the damp. They , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: were a long while trying to discover why the accused man , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: should tell a lie about this, when about everything else he , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: had made a truthful and straightforward confession. Finally , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: some of the lawyers more versed in psychology admitted , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: that it was possible he had really not looked into the purse, , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: and so didn’t know what was in it when he hid it under , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: the stone. But they immediately drew the deduction that , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: the crime could only have been committed through , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: temporary mental derangement, through homicidal mania, , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: without object or the pursuit of gain. This fell in with the , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: most recent fashionable theory of temporary insanity, so , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: Raskolnikov’s hypochondriacal condition was proved by , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: many witnesses, by Dr. Zossimov, his former fellow , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: students, his landlady and her servant. All this pointed , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: strongly to the conclusion that Raskolnikov was not quite , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: like an ordinary murderer and robber, but that there was , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: another element in the case. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: To the intense annoyance of those who maintained this , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: opinion, the criminal scarcely attempted to defend himself. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: To the decisive question as to what motive impelled him , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: to the murder and the robbery, he answered very clearly , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: with the coarsest frankness that the cause was his miserable , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: position, his poverty and helplessness, and his desire to , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: provide for his first steps in life by the help of the three , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: thousand roubles he had reckoned on finding. He had , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: been led to the murder through his shallow and cowardly , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: nature, exasperated moreover by privation and failure. To , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: the question what led him to confess, he answered that it , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: was his heartfelt repentance. All this was almost coarse…. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: The sentence however was more merciful than could , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: have been expected, perhaps partly because the criminal , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: had not tried to justify himself, but had rather shown a , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: desire to exaggerate his guilt. All the strange and peculiar , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: stricken condition of the criminal at the time. The fact , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: that he had made no use of what he had stolen was put , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: down partly to the effect of remorse, partly to his , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: abnormal mental condition at the time of the crime. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: Incidentally the murder of Lizaveta served indeed to , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: confirm the last hypothesis: a man commits two murders , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: and forgets that the door is open! Finally, the confession, , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: at the very moment when the case was hopelessly , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: muddled by the false evidence given by Nikolay through , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: melancholy and fanaticism, and when, moreover, there , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: were no proofs against the real criminal, no suspicions , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: even (Porfiry Petrovitch fully kept his word) —all this did , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: much to soften the sentence. Other circumstances, too, in , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: the prisoner’s favour came out quite unexpectedly. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: Razumihin somehow discovered and proved that while , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: Raskolnikov was at the university he had helped a poor , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: maintained almost from his thirteenth year, Raskolnikov , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: had got the old man into a hospital and paid for his funeral , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: with tears how he had come to say good-bye to her, , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: hinting that she alone knew many mysterious and , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: As for his future career, she had no doubt that it would be , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: brilliant when certain sinister influences could be , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: one day a great statesman, that his article and brilliant , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: literary talent proved it. This article she was continually , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: reading, she even read it aloud, almost took it to bed with , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: her, but scarcely asked where Rodya was, though the , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: subject was obviously avoided by the others, which might , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: have been enough to awaken her suspicions. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: They began to be frightened at last at Pulcheria , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: Alexandrovna’s strange silence on certain subjects. She did , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: though in previous years she had only lived on the hope of , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: letters from her beloved Rodya. This was the cause of , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: great uneasiness to Dounia; the idea occurred to her that , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: her mother suspected that there was something terrible in , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: her son’s fate and was afraid to ask, for fear of hearing , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: something still more awful. In any case, Dounia saw , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: faculties. , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: It happened once or twice, however, that Pulcheria , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: Alexandrovna gave such a turn to the conversation that it , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: was impossible to answer her without mentioning where , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: Rodya was, and on receiving unsatisfactory and suspicious , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: answers she became at once gloomy and silent, and this , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: mood lasted for a long time. Dounia saw at last that it was , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: hard to deceive her and came to the conclusion that it was , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: better to be absolutely silent on certain points; but it , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: became more and more evident that the poor mother , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: suspected something terrible. Dounia remembered her , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: talking in her sleep on the night after her interview with , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: and even weeks of gloomy silence and tears would be , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: succeeded by a period of hysterical animation, and the , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: of her hopes of his future…. Her fancies were sometimes , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: Raskolnikov had been very dreamy for a few days , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0

Text: her that it alarmed Dounia. When he heard about his , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: mother’s illness he became very gloomy. With Sonia he , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
Text: was particularly reserved all the time. With the help of the , Font: Bembo, Size: 12.0
